    <th>risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks before investing in our common stock. these risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. you could lose part or all of your investment. risks relating to our businessesinterest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and profitability. our insurance and investment products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and expose us to the risk that falling interest rates will reduce our "spread," or the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under these products and the amounts that we must pay policyholders and contractholders. because we may reduce the interest rates we credit on most of these products only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because some of them have guaranteed minimum crediting rates, declines in interest rates may adversely affect the profitability of those products. for example, interest rates declined to unusually low levels from 2001 to 2003. during this period, our net earnings from spread-based products, such as fixed and income annuities and guaranteed investment contracts, declined from $207 million for the year ended december31, 2001 to $138 million for the year ended december31, 2003. during periods of increasing market interest rates, we must offer higher crediting rates on interest-sensitive products, such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities, and we must increase crediting rates on in-force products to keep these products competitive. in addition, increases in market interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans, as policyholders and contractholders seek to shift assets to products with perceived higher returns. increases in crediting rates, as well as surrenders and withdrawals, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. an increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals also may require us to accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition costs or other intangibles or cause an impairment of goodwill, which would reduce our net earnings. our long-term care insurance products also expose us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. the pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns. over time, long-term care insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums, which we invest as we receive them. declining interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and may adversely affect the profitability of our long-term care insurance products. in our mortgage insurance business, rising interest rates generally reduce the volume of new mortgages, resulting in a decrease in the volume of new insurance written. rising interest rates also can increase the monthly mortgage payments for insured homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages, or arms, which could have the effect of increasing default rates on arm loans and thereby increasing our exposure on our mortgage insurance policies. this is particularly relevant in our non-u.s. mortgage insurance business, where armsare the predominant mortgage product. declining interest rates increase the rate at which insured borrowers refinance their existing mortgages, thereby resulting in cancellations of the mortgage insurance covering the refinanced loans. declining interest rates also generally are associated with home price appreciation, which may provide insured borrowers the option of canceling their mortgage insurance coverage earlier than we anticipated in pricing that coverage. these cancellations could have an adverse effect on our results from our mortgage insurance business. interest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio. during periods of declining market interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases. in addition, during those periods, we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. issuers of fixed-income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates the risk that we may have to invest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower-yielding or lower-credit instruments. declining interest rates from 2001 to 2003 contributed to a decrease in our weighted average investment yield from 6.5% for the year ended december31, 2001 to 5.2% for the year ended december31, 2003. for additional information regarding our investment portfolio, see "businessinvestments." for additional information regarding the sensitivity of the fixed maturities in our investment portfolio to interest rate fluctuations, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risksensitivity analysis."downturns and volatility in equity markets could adversely affect our business and profitability. significant downturns and volatility in equity markets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in three principal ways. first, market downturns and volatility may cause potential new purchasers of our products to refrain from purchasing products, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance, that have returns linked to the performance of the equity markets and may cause current policyholders and contractholders to withdraw cash values from those products. the sharp declines in the equity markets during 2001 and 2002 have had adverse impacts on our sales of variable annuities and other products linked to equity markets. for example, our deposits for variable annuities decreased by 28% from $2,309million for the year ended december31, 2001 to $1,667million for the year ended december31, 2002. second, downturns and volatility in equity markets can have an adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our separate account and private asset management products and services. because these products depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, declines in the equity markets have reduced our revenues by reducing the value of the investment assets we manage. for example, the recent equity market downturn caused a reduction in the value of the separate account assets underlying our variable life insurance policies, variable annuities and assets under management. as a result, our policy fees and other income in our retirement income and investments segment decreased by 7% from $243million for the year ended december31, 2002 to $225million for the year ended december31, 2003. in addition, some of our variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum income payments tied to the investment performance of the assets held within the variable annuity. a significant market decline could result in declines in account values which could increase our payments under the guaranteed minimum death benefits and certain income payments in connection with variable annuities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. third, we are exposed to equity risk on our holdings of common stock and other equities. an economic downturn, corporate malfeasance or a variety of other factors could cause declines in the value of our equity portfolio and cause our net earnings to decline. for additional information regarding the sensitivity of the equity securities in our investment portfolio to equity market fluctuations, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risksensitivity analysis."defaults in our fixed-income securities portfolio may reduce our earnings. issuers of the fixed-income securities that we own may default on principal and interest payments. as of each of march31, 2004 and december31, 2003 and 2002, 93% of our fixed maturities had ratings equivalent to investment-grade. nevertheless, as a result of the economic downturn and recent corporate malfeasance, the number of companies defaulting on their debt obligations increased dramatically in 2001 and 2002. as of march31, 2004 and december31, 2003 and 2002, we had fixed maturities in or near default (where the issuer has missed payment of principal or interest or entered bankruptcy) with a fair value of $177million, $190million and $181million, respectively. an economic downturn, further events of corporate malfeasance or a variety of other factors could cause declines in the value of our fixed maturities porfolio and cause our net earnings to decline. we recognized gross capital gains of $27million, $181million, $473million, $790million and $814million for the three months ended march31, 2004 and 2003 and the years ended december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. we realized these capital gains in part to offset default-related losses during those periods. however, capital gains may not be available in the future, and if they are, we may elect not to recognize capital gains to offset losses.a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. financial strength ratings, which various ratings organizations publish as measures of an insurance company's ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintaining public confidence in our products, the ability to market our products and our competitive position. a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including: reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other investment products; adversely affecting our relationships with independent sales intermediaries and our dedicated sales specialists; materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders; requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance. in connection with our initial public offering and separation from ge, our principal life insurance companies were downgraded from financial strength ratings of "aa" (very strong) by s&p and "aa2" (excellent) by moody's, to "aa-" (very strong) and "aa3" (excellent), respectively. in addition, as a result of our 2003 decision to reduce excess capital at our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, our mortgage insurance companies were downgraded from financial strength ratings of "aaa" (extremely strong) by s&p and fitch and "aaa" (exceptional) by moody's to "aa" (very strong) by s&p and fitch and "aa2" (excellent) by moody's. although we do not believe that these downgrades have negatively affected our business overall in any material respect, we cannot assure you that they will not have an adverse effect over time or that our ratings will not be further downgraded in the future. the "aa" and "aa-" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of s&p's 21 ratings categories, respectively. the "aa2" and "aa3" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of moody's 21 ratings categories, respectively. the "aa" rating is the third-highest of fitch's 24 ratings categories. the charters of the federal national mortgage corporation, or fannie mae, and the federal home loan mortgage corporation, or freddie mac, only permit them to buy high loan-to-value mortgages that are insured by a "qualified insurer," as determined by each of them. their current rules effectively provide that they will accept mortgage insurance only from private mortgage insurers with financial strength ratings of at least "aa-" by s&p and "aa3" by moody's. if our mortgage insurance companies' financial strength ratings decrease below the thresholds established by fannie mae and freddie mac, we would not be able to insure mortgages purchased by fannie mae or freddie mac. approximately 69% and 68% of the loans we insured in the u.s. during the three months ended march31, 2004 and the year ended december31, 2003, respectively, were sold to either fannie mae or freddie mac. an inability to insure mortgage loans sold to fannie mae or freddie mac, or their transfer of our existing policies to an alternative mortgage insurer, would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in 2003, the u.s. office of federal housing enterprise oversight announced a risk-based capital rule that treats credit enhancements issued by private mortgage insurers with financial strength ratings of "aaa" more favorably than those issued by "aa" rated insurers. neither fannie mae nor freddie mac has adopted policies that distinguish between "aa" rated and "aaa" rated mortgage insurers. however, if fannie mae or freddie mac adopts policies that treat "aaa" rated insurers more favorably than "aa" rated insurers, our competitive position may suffer. our mortgage insurance subsidiaries in canada and australia are also subject to local regulations that require them to maintain specified financial strength ratings to continue their operations. in addition to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, ratings agencies also publish credit ratings for our company. the credit ratings have an impact on the interest rates we pay on the money we borrow. therefore, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are not evaluations directed to the protection of investors in our common stock. the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries described under "businessfinancial strength ratings" reflect each rating agency's current opinion of each subsidiary's financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders and contractholders. these factors are of concern to policyholders, contractholders, agents, sales intermediaries and lenders. ratings are not evaluations directed to the protection of investors in our common stock. they are not ratings of our common stock and should not be relied upon when making a decision to buy, hold or sell our shares of common stock or any other security. in addition, the standards used by rating agencies in determining financial strength are different from capital requirements set by state insurance regulators. we may need to take actions in response to changing standards set by any of the ratings agencies, as well as statutory capital requirements, which could cause our business and operations to suffer.if our reserves for future policy benefits and claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish reserve liabilities to provide for future obligations under our insurance policies, annuities and other investment products, and mortgage insurance contract underwriting arrangements. reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are estimates of expected net policy and contract benefits and claims payments over time. our reserving assumptions and estimates require significant judgments and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual benefit and claim payments, the timing of those payments, or whether the assets supporting our policy and contract liabilities will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of benefits or claims. we continually monitor our reserves. if we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claims payments, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. for more information on how we set our reserves, see "businessreserves."as a holding company, we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations. we will act as a holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and will not have any significant operations of our own. dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our tax sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries will be our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations. these obligations will include our operating expenses, interest and principal on debt and contract adjustment payments on our equity units. these obligations also include amounts we will owe to ge under the tax matters agreement that we and ge will enter into prior to the completion of this offering. if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets. the payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations. in general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed "extraordinary" and require insurance regulatory approval. see "regulation." during the years ended december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we received dividends from our insurance subsidiaries of $1,472million ($1,400million of which were deemed "extraordinary"), $840million ($375million of which were deemed "extraordinary") and $410million (none of which were deemed "extraordinary"), respectively. in addition, during the years ended december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we received dividends from insurance subsidiaries related to discontinued operations of $495million, $62million and $0, respectively. based on statutory results as of december31, 2003, our subsidiaries could pay dividends of $1,121million to us in 2004 without obtaining regulatory approval. however, as a result of the dividends we will pay in connection with our corporate reorganization, most of our insurance subsidiaries will not be able to pay us any additional dividends for the twelve months following this offering without prior regulatory approval. as part of our corporate reorganization, we will retain cash at the holding company level which we believe will be adequate to fund our dividend payments, debt service, obligations under the tax matters agreement and other obligations until our subsidiaries can resume paying dividends to us. in addition, the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, are subject to various conditions imposed by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings.some of our investments are relatively illiquid. our investments in privately placed fixed maturities, mortgage loans, policy loans, limited partnership interests, real estate and restricted investments held by securitization entities are relatively illiquid. these asset classes represented approximately 30% of the carrying value of our total cash and invested assets as of march31, 2004, on a pro forma basis. if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. for example, our floating rate funding agreements generally contain "put" provisions through which a contractholder may terminate the funding agreement for any reason after giving notice within the contract's specified notice period, which is generally 90days but can be less than 30days. as of march31, 2004, the aggregate amount of our outstanding funding agreements with put option features was approximately $2.4billion, and the aggregate amount of funding agreements with put option notice periods of 30days or less was $450million. if an unexpected number of contractholders exercise this right and we are unable to access other liquidity sources, we may have to liquidate assets quickly. our inability to quickly dispose of illiquid investments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability. our businesses are subject to intense competition. we believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of our products are product features, price, commission structure, marketing and distribution arrangements, brand, reputation, financial strength ratings and service. many other companies actively compete for sales in our protection and retirement income and investments markets, including other major insurers, banks, other financial institutions and specialty providers. the principal direct and indirect competitors for our mortgage insurance business include other private mortgage insurers, as well as federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies in the u.s., including the federal housing administration, or fha, and to a lesser degree, the veterans administration, or va, fannie mae and freddie mac, as well as local and state housing finance agencies. we also compete in our mortgage insurance business with structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to manage credit risk, such as credit default swaps and credit linked notes, with lenders who forego mortgage insurance, or self-insure, on loans held in their portfolios, and with lenders that provide mortgage reinsurance through captive mortgage reinsurance programs. in canada and some european countries, our mortgage insurance business competes directly with government entities, which provide comparable mortgage insurance. government entities with which we compete typically do not have the same capital requirements and do not have the same profit objectives as we do. although private companies, such as our company, establish pricing terms for their products to achieve targeted returns, these government entities may offer products on terms designed to accomplish social or political objectives or reflect other non-economic goals. in many of our product lines, we face competition from competitors that have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do. many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels. the substantial expansion of banks' and insurance companies' distribution capacities and expansion of product features in recent years have intensified pressure on margins and production levels and have increased the level of competition in many of our business lines.we may be unable to attract and retain independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists. we distribute our products through financial intermediaries, independent producers and dedicated sales specialists. we compete with other financial institutions to attract and retain commercial relationships in each of these channels, and our success in competing for sales through these sales intermediaries depends upon factors such as the amount of sales commissions and fees we pay, the breadth of our product offerings, the strength of our brand, our perceived stability and our financial strength ratings, the marketing and services we provide to them and the strength of the relationships we maintain with individuals at those firms. from time to time, due to competitive forces, we have experienced unusually high attrition in particular sales channels for specific products. our inability to continue to recruit productive independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists, or our inability to retain strong relationships with the individual agents at our independent sales intermediaries, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.if the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to the derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks default, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we use reinsurance and derivative instruments to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. we cannot assure you that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverable owed to us now or in the future or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. a reinsurer's insolvency or inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. prior to the completion of this offering, we will cede to uflic, effective as of january1, 2004, policy obligations under our structured settlement contracts, which had reserves of $12.0billion, and our variable annuity contracts, which had general account reserves of $2.8billion and separate account reserves of $7.9billion, in each case as of december31, 2003. these contracts represent substantially all of our contracts that were in force as of december31, 2003 for these products. in addition, effective as of january1, 2004, we will cede to uflic policy obligations under a block of long-term care insurance policies that we reinsured from travelers, which had reserves of $1.5billion as of december31, 2003. uflic has agreed to establish trust accounts for our benefit to secure its obligations under the reinsurance arrangements, and general electric capital corporation, an indirect subsidiary of ge, or ge capital, has agreed to maintain uflic's risk-based capital above a specified minimum level. if uflic becomes insolvent notwithstanding this agreement, and the amounts in the trust accounts are insufficient to pay uflic's obligations to us, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. see "arrangements between ge and our companyreinsurance transactions." in addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various business risks. we enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate and currency swaps and options to enter into interest rate and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. if our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. that failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and international securities markets could negatively affect our profitability. our international operations generate revenues denominated in local currencies. for the three months ended march31, 2004 and 2003, and the years ended december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, 20%, 16%, 18%, 14% and 14% of our revenues, and 32%, 23%, 26%, 12% and 11% of our net earnings from continuing operations were generated by our international operations. we generally invest cash generated by our international operations in securities denominated in local currencies. as of each of march31, 2004 and december31, 2003 and 2002, approximately 5% of our invested assets were held by our international operations and were invested primarily in non-u.s.-denominated securities. although investing in securities denominated in local currencies limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results, we remain exposed to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates as we translate the operating results of our foreign operations into our combined financial statements. we currently do not hedge this exposure, and as a result, period-to-period comparability of our results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. for example, our net earnings for the three months ended march31, 2004 and the year ended december31, 2003, included approximately $12million and $25million, respectively, due to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. in addition, because we derive a significant portion of our earnings from non-u.s.-denominated revenue, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent the dollar value of non-u.s.-denominated revenue is reduced due to a strengthening u.s. dollar. in addition, our investments in non-u.s.-denominated securities are subject to fluctuations in non-u.s. securities and currency markets, and those markets can be volatile. non-u.s. currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to their parent companies in the u.s. for additional information regarding the sensitivity of our net earnings to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risksensitivity analysis."our insurance businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. our non-u.s. insurance operations are regulated principally by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled. state laws in the u.s. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; approving changes in control of insurance companies; restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners, or naic, regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. changes in these laws and regulations are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our mortgage insurance business is subject to additional laws and regulations. for a discussion of the risks associated with those laws and regulations, see "risks relating to our mortgage insurance businesschanges in regulations that affect the mortgage insurance business could affect our operations significantly and could reduce the demand for mortgage insurance." currently, the u.s. federal government does not regulate directly the business of insurance. however, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. these areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. in addition, legislation has been introduced in the u.s. senate, which, if ena</th>

    <th>an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the following risk factors and the other information contained in this prospectus before you decide to purchase our common stock. additional risks that are not currently known or foreseeable to us may materialize at a future date. the trading price of our common stock could decline if any of these risks or uncertainties occur and you might lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our businesswe have a history of operating losses and we expect to continue to incur losses and may never be profitable. as of september 30, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $225.1million. we had net losses of $53.0 million and $60.4 million for the nine month period september 30, 2006 and the year ended december 31, 2005, respectively. we have had operating losses since inception as a result of our significant clinical development, research and development, general and administrative, sales and marketing and business development expenses. we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years as we expand our sales and marketing capabilities and continue our clinical trials and research and development activities. our prospects for achieving profitability will depend primarily on how successful we are in executing our business plan to: market and sell zanaflex capsules; obtain fda approval for and commercialize fampridine-sr; continue to develop our preclinical product candidates and advance them into clinical trials; and enter into strategic partnerships and collaboration arrangements related to our drug discovery programs and product candidates. if we are not successful in executing our business plan, we may never achieve or may not sustain profitability.we will be substantially dependent on sales of one product, zanaflex capsules, to generate revenue for the foreseeable future. we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets, which are our only fda-approved products. although we currently distribute zanaflex tablets, our marketing efforts are focused on zanaflex capsules and we do not, and do not intend to, actively promote zanaflex tablets. as a result, prescriptions for zanaflex tablets have declined and we expect that they will continue to decline. our goal is to convert sales of zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets to sales of zanaflex capsules. we believe that sales of zanaflex capsules will constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. if we are unable to convert tablet sales to capsule sales or are otherwise unable to increase our revenue from the sale of this product, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.if we are unable to successfully differentiate zanaflex capsules from both zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets we may not be able to increase sales of zanaflex capsules. there are currently 12 companies with generic versions of tizanidine tablets on the market and they are significantly cheaper than either zanaflex capsules or zanaflex tablets. as of september 30, 2006, these generic versions of tizanidine tablets constituted approximately 95% of tizanidine sales in the unitedstates. although zanaflex capsules have a different pharmacokinetic profile when taken with food 6 and are available in a higher dose than zanaflex tablets and their generic equivalents, we may be unsuccessful in convincing prescribers, patients and third-party payors that these differences justify the higher price of zanaflex capsules. prescribers may prescribe generic tizanidine tablets instead of zanaflex capsules, and third-party payors may establish unfavorable reimbursement policies for zanaflex capsules or otherwise seek to encourage patients and prescribers to use generic tizanidine tablets instead of zanaflex capsules. in addition, although the fda has determined that neither zanaflex tablets nor generic tizanidine tablets are equivalent, or ab-rated, to zanaflex capsules, pharmacists may improperly fill prescriptions with generic tizanidine tablets or may seek to influence patients or physicians to change prescriptions from zanaflex capsules to generic tizanidine tablets. if we are unable to successfully differentiate zanaflex capsules from zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets in the minds of prescribers, pharmacists, patients and third-party payors, our ability to generate meaningful revenue from this product will be adversely affected.our company has limited sales and marketing experience and we may not be successful in building an effective sales and marketing organization to market zanaflex capsules to specialty physicians. as a company, we have limited sales and marketing experience, having only launched zanaflex capsules in april2005. in order to successfully commercialize zanaflex capsules or any other products that we may bring to market, we will need to have adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. although we intend to increase our sales force from 32 to 65 persons, we may not be able to attract, train and retain skilled sales and marketing personnel, in a timely manner or at all, or integrate and manage a growing sales and marketing organization. in addition, we may not succeed in increasing our sales of zanaflex capsules sufficiently to justify the expense associated with our expanded sales force, which would adversely affect our cash flow and our prospects for achieving profitability. we had initially planned to target potential high-prescribing primary care physicians through contract sales representative companies, cardinal health pts, llc and innovex, inc., that had been hired to provide sales representatives targeting the primary care market. we now intend to address that market through our expanded sales force. there can be no assurances that our sales force will be effective in reaching the primary care market.our product candidates must undergo rigorous clinical testing, the results of which are uncertain and could substantially delay or prevent us from bringing them to market. before we can obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we must undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda and other regulatory agencies. clinical trials of new product candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensive and take years to complete, and the outcome of such trials is uncertain. clinical development of any product candidate that we determine to take into clinical trials may be curtailed, redirected, delayed or eliminated at any time for some or all of the following reasons: negative or ambiguous results regarding the efficacy of the product candidate; undesirable side effects that delay or extend the trials, or other unforeseen or undesirable safety issues that make the product candidate not medically or commercially viable; inability to locate, recruit and qualify a sufficient number of patients for our trials; difficulty in determining meaningful end points or other measurements of success in our clinical trials; regulatory delays or other regulatory actions, including changes in regulatory requirements; 7 difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of the product candidate manufactured under current good manufacturing practices; delays, suspension or termination of the trials imposed by us, an independent institutional review board for a clinical trial site, or clinical holds placed upon the trials by the fda; fda approval of new drugs that are more effective than our product candidates; change in the focus of our development efforts or a re-evaluation of our clinical development strategy; and a change in our financial position. a delay in or termination of any of our clinical development programs could have an adverse effect on our business.if any additional studies required by the fda for fampridine-sr do not yield favorable results or we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for fampridine-sr, or any approval is unduly limited in scope or delayed, our business prospects will be adversely affected. in september 2006, we announced positive results from our phase 3 clinical trial of fampridine-sr for the improvement of walking in patients with ms, which was performed under a spa from the fda. although statistical significance was achieved on all three efficacy criteria defined in the spa, typically, positive results from at least one other clinical trial are needed to support the filing of an nda with the fda. based on our december 2006 meeting with the fda, we will design and conduct an additional phase 3 trial of fampridine-sr in people with ms. in addition, we will execute a qt safety cardiac study in accordance with the fdas october 2005 guidance, clinical evaluation of qt/qtc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for non-antiarrhythmic drugs. we cannot predict how long these two studies, or any additional studies that might be required by the fda, will take or what the cost will be. in addition, if the fda determines that a new substantial scientific issue regarding the safety or efficacy of fampridine-sr is identified, the fda may alter its conclusion, expressed in the spa, regarding the adequacy of the phase 3 protocol. the fda may also identify a need for studies in addition to the second phase3 trial and the qt safety cardiac study to confirm efficacy that would examine safety or other properties or characteristics of the drug. notwithstanding the results of our clinical trials, the fda could determine that the overall balance of risks and benefits for fampridine-sr is not adequate to support approval, or only justifies approval for a narrow set of uses or approval with restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements and limitations. if the fda denies approval of fampridine-sr in ms, if fda approval is substantially delayed, if approval is granted on a narrow basis or with restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements, or if the fampridine-sr program is terminated, our business prospects will be adversely affected. in march2004, we completed two phase 3 clinical trials of fampridine-sr in sci in which our results failed to reach their primary endpoints. we may resume development of fampridine-sr for sci after we have completed further development of the drug for ms. we cannot predict whether future clinical trials of fampridine-sr in sci will achieve their primary endpoints, how long these clinical trials will take or how much they will cost.our other drug development programs are in early stages of development and may never be commercialized. all of our development programs other than fampridine-sr are in the preclinical phase. our future success depends, in part, on our ability to select successful product candidates, complete preclinical development of these product candidates and advance them to clinical trials. these product candidates will 8 require significant development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory clearances and substantial additional investment before they can be commercialized. our preclinical programs may not lead to commercially viable products for several reasons. for example, we may fail to identify promising product candidates, our product candidates may fail to be safe and effective in preclinical tests or clinical trials, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue discovery and development efforts for new product candidates. in addition, because we have limited resources, we are focusing on product candidates that we believe are the most promising. as a result, we may delay or forego pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates. from time to time, we may establish and announce certain development goals for our product candidates and programs; however, given the complex nature of the drug discovery and development process, it is difficult to predict accurately if and when we will achieve these goals. if we are unsuccessful in advancing our preclinical programs into clinical testing or in obtaining regulatory approval, our long-term business prospects will be harmed.the pharmaceutical industry is subject to stringent regulation and failure to obtain regulatory approval will prevent commercialization of our product candidates. our research, development, preclinical and clinical trial activities, as well as the manufacture and marketing of any products that we may successfully develop, are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the fda and other regulatory agencies abroad. the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals for drugs is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and any regulatory approvals may contain limitations on the indicated usage of a drug, distribution restrictions or may be conditioned on burdensome post-approval study or other requirements, including the requirement that we institute and follow a special risk management plan to monitor and manage potential safety issues, all of which may eliminate or reduce the drugs market potential. post-market evaluation of a product could result in marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market. the results of preclinical and phase 1 and phase 2 clinical studies are not necessarily indicative of whether a product will demonstrate safety and efficacy in larger patient populations, as evaluated in phase3 clinical trials. additional adverse events that could impact commercial success, or even continued regulatory approval, might emerge with more extensive post-approval patient use. of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an nda to the fda and even fewer are approved for commercialization. in order to conduct clinical trials to obtain fda approval to commercialize any product candidate, an ind application must first be submitted to the fda and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. subsequently, an nda must be submitted to the fda, including the results of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating, among other things, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in humans for each target indication. in addition, the manufacturing facilities used to produce the products must comply with current good manufacturing practices and must pass a pre-approval fda inspection. extensive submissions of preclinical and clinical trial data are required to demonstrate the safety, efficacy, potency and purity for each intended use. the fda may refuse to accept our regulatory submissions for filing if they are incomplete. clinical trials are subject to oversight by institutional review boards and the fda to ensure compliance with the fdas good clinical practice requirements, as well as other requirements for the protection of clinical trial participants. we depend, in part, on third-party laboratories and medical institutions to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials for our products and other third-party organizations to perform data collection and analysis, all of which must maintain both good laboratory and good clinical practices required by regulators. if any such standards are not complied with in our clinical trials, the resulting data from the clinical trial may not be usable or we, an institutional review board or the 9 fda may suspend or terminate such trial, which would severely delay our development and possibly end the development of such product candidate. we also depend upon third party manufacturers of our products to qualify for fda approval and to comply with good manufacturing practices required by regulators. we cannot be certain that our present or future manufacturers and suppliers will comply with current good manufacturing practices. the failure to comply with good manufacturing practices may result in the termination of clinical studies, restrictions in the sale of, or withdrawal of the products from the market. compliance by third parties with these standards and practices is outside of our direct control. in addition, we are subject to regulation under other state and federal laws, including requirements regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and may be subject to other local, state, federal and foreign regulations. we cannot predict the impact of such regulations on us, although it could impose significant restrictions on our business and additional expenses to comply with these regulations.our products and product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenue. market acceptance of our products and product candidates will depend on the benefits of our products in terms of safety, efficacy, convenience, ease of administration and cost effectiveness and our ability to demonstrate these benefits to physicians and patients. we believe market acceptance also depends on the pricing of our products and the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors, as well as on the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities. physicians may not prescribe our products, and patients may determine, for any reason, that our products are not useful to them. for example, physicians may not believe that the benefits of zanaflex capsules outweigh their higher cost in relation to zanaflex tablets or generic tizanidine tablets. the failure of any of our products or product candidates, once approved, to achieve market acceptance would limit our ability to generate revenue and would adversely affect our results of operations.our potential products may not be commercially viable if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for these products by medicaid, medicare or other third-party payors. our commercial success will depend in part on third-party payors, such as government health administrative authorities, including medicaid and medicare, private health insurers and other such organizations, agreeing to reimburse patients for the cost of our products. significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly-approved healthcare products. our business would be materially adversely affected if the medicaid program, medicare program or other third-party payors were to deny reimbursement for our products or provide reimbursement only on unfavorable terms. our business could also be adversely affected if the medicaid program, medicare program or other reimbursing bodies or payors limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed to a smaller set of indications than we believe is appropriate. third-party payors frequently require that drug companies negotiate agreements with them that provide discounts or rebates from list prices. at present we do not have any such agreements with private third-party payors and only a small number of such agreements with government payors. if sales of zanaflex capsules increase we may need to offer larger discounts or discounts to a greater number of third-party payors to maintain acceptable reimbursement levels. if we were required to negotiate such agreements, there is no guarantee that we would be able to negotiate them at price levels that are profitable to us, or at all. if we are unsuccessful in maintaining reimbursement for our products at acceptable levels, our business will be adversely affected. in addition, if our competitors reduce the prices of their products, or otherwise demonstrate that they are better or more cost effective than our products, this may result in a greater level of reimbursement for their products relative to our products, which would reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations. we may experience pressure to lower prices on our approved products due to new and/or proposed federal legislation. federal legislation enacted in december2003 added an outpatient prescription drug benefit to medicare, effective january2006. the benefit is provided primarily through private entities, which attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. these negotiations increase pressure to lower prescription drug prices. while the new law specifically prohibits the u.s. government from interfering in price negotiations between manufacturers and medicare drug plan sponsors, some members of congress are pursuing legislation that would permit the u.s. government to use its enormous purchasing power to demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies, thereby creating de facto price controls on prescription drugs. in addition, the new law contains triggers for congressional consideration of cost containment measures for medicare in the event medicare cost increases exceed a certain level. these cost containment measures could include limitations on prescription drug prices. this medicare prescription drug coverage legislation, as well as additional healthcare legislation that may be enacted at a future date, could reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations.if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or more convenient than our approved products, or obtain marketing approval before we obtain approval of future products, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated. competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense and is expected to increase. composition of matter patents on tizanidine, the active ingredient in zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets, expired in 2002. as of september30, 2006, there were currently 12 companies with generic versions of tizanidine tablets on the market. to the extent that we are not able to differentiate zanaflex capsules from zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets and/or pharmacists improperly substitute generic tizanidine tablets when filling prescriptions for zanaflex capsules, we may be unable to convert additional sales of zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets to zanaflex capsules and our ability to generate revenue from this product will be adversely affected. although no other fda-approved capsule formulation of tizanidine exists, another company could develop a capsule or other formulation of tizanidine that competes with zanaflex capsules. many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are involved in research and/or product development for various neurological diseases, including ms and sci. we are aware of a company developing a sodium/potassium channel blocker and a second company developing an immediate release form of fampridine, both of which may compete with fampridine-sr, if approved. in certain circumstances, pharmacists are not prohibited from formulating certain drug compounds to fill prescriptions on an individual patient basis. we are aware that at present compounded fampridine is used by some people with ms or sci and it is possible that some people will want to continue to use compounded formulations even if fampridine-sr is approved. several companies are engaged in developing products that include novel immune system approaches and cell transplant approaches to remyelination for the treatment of people with ms. these programs are in early stages of development and may compete in the future with fampridine-sr or our preclinical candidates. our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective, safer or more convenient than our products or the ones we have under development or that render our approved or proposed products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. in addition, our competitors may achieve product commercialization before we do. if any of our competitors develops a product that is more effective, safer or more convenient for patients, or is able to obtain fda approval for commercialization before we do, we may not be able to achieve market acceptance for our products, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and recover the substantial development costs we have incurred and will continue to incur. 11 our products may be subject to competition from lower-priced versions of such products and competing products imported into the united states from canada, mexico and other countries where there are government price controls or other market dynamics that make the products lower priced.our operations could be curtailed if we are unable to obtain any necessary additional financing on favorable terms or at all. on september 30, 2006, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to our private placement in october2006, we would have approximately $48.2million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. although we anticipate this will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our financial obligations through the first quarter of 2008 based on our current projected revenue and spending levels, we have several product candidates in various stages of development, and all will require significant further investment to develop, test and obtain regulatory approval prior to commercialization. we will likely need to seek additional equity or debt financing or strategic collaborations to continue our product development activities, and could require substantial funding to commercialize any products that we successfully develop. we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all. to the extent that we are able to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of those securities would result in dilution to our stockholders. holders of such new equity securities may also have rights, preference or privileges that are senior to yours. if additional capital is raised through the incurrence of indebtedness, we may become subject to various restrictions and covenants that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, provide for unanticipated capital investments or take advantage of business opportunities. to the extent funding is raised through collaborations or intellectual property-based financings, we may be required to give up some or all of the rights and related intellectual property to one or more of our products, product candidates or preclinical programs. if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms when and if needed, we may be required to reduce, defer or discontinue one or more of our product development programs or devote fewer resources to marketing zanaflex capsules.under our financing arrangement with the paul royalty fund, or prf, upon the occurrence of certain events, prf may require us to repurchase the right to receive revenues that we assigned to it or may foreclose on certain assets that secure our obligations to prf. any exercise by prf of its right to cause us to repurchase the assigned right or any foreclosure by prf could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition. on december23, 2005, we entered into a revenue interests assignment agreement with prf, which was amended on november28, 2006, pursuant to which we assigned to prf the right to receive a portion of our net revenues from zanaflex capsules, zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products. to secure our obligations to prf, we also granted prf a security interest in substantially all of our assets related to zanaflex. under our arrangement with prf, upon the occurrence of certain events, including if we experience a change of control, undergo certain bankruptcy events, transfer any of our interests in zanaflex (other than pursuant to a license agreement, development, commercialization, co-promotion, collaboration, partnering or similar agreement), transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or breach certain of the covenants, representations or warranties under the revenue interests assignment agreement, prf may (i)require us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it at the put/call price in effect on the date such right is exercised or (ii)foreclose on the zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to prf. except in the case of certain bankruptcy events, if prf exercises its right to cause us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it, prf may not foreclose unless we fail to pay the put/call price as required. the put/call price on a given date is the greater of (i)150% of all payments made by prf to us as of such date, less all payments received by prf from us as of such date, and (ii)an amount that would generate an internal rate of return to prf of 12 25% on all payments made by prf to us as of such date, taking into account the amount and timing of all payments received by prf from us as of such date. if prf were to exercise its right to cause us to repurchase the right we assigned to it, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available to pay the put/call price in effect at that time. even if we have sufficient funds available, we may have to use funds that we planned to use for other purposes and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. if prf were to foreclose on the zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to prf, our results of operations and financial condition could also be adversely affected. because prfs right to cause us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it is triggered by, among other things, a change in control, transfer of any of our interests in zanaflex (other than pursuant to a license agreement, development, commercialization, co-promotion, collaboration, partnering or similar agreement) or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, the existence of that right could discourage us or a potential acquirer from entering into a business transaction that would result in the occurrence of any of those events.the loss of our key management and scientific personnel may hinder our ability to execute our business plan. our success depends on the continuing contributions of our management team and scientific personnel, and maintaining relationships with our scientific and medical network and the network of centers in the united states and canada that conducts our clinical trials. we are highly dependent on the services of dr.ron cohen, our president and chief executive officer, as well as the other principal members of our management and scientific staff. our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. we face intense competition in our hiring efforts with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations, and we may have to pay higher salaries to attract and retain qualified personnel. with the exception of dr.ron cohen, we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on the lives of our officers, directors or employees. the loss of one or more of our key employees, or our inability to attract additional qualified personnel, could substantially impair our ability to implement our business plan.we face an inherent risk of liability in the event that the use or misuse of our products results in personal injury or death. if the use or misuse of zanaflex capsules or any other fda-approved products we may sell in the future harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, third-party payors or others. the use of our product candidates in clinical trials could also expose us to product liability claims. we currently maintain a product liability insurance policy that includes coverage of our clinical trials. this insurance policy has a $10million per claim limit and the aggregate amount of claims under the policy is also capped at $10million. we cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result from the use of our products or the testing of product candidates and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we currently have may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or defense costs we might incur. a product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could give rise to a substantial liability that could exceed our resources. even if claims are not successful, the costs of defending such claims and potential adverse publicity could be harmful to our business. we are subject to various federal and state laws regulating the marketing of zanaflex capsules and, if we do not comply with these regulations, we could face substant</th>

    <th>RISK FACTORS An investment in the Common Stock offered hereby involves a high degree of risk, including the risks described below. In addition to the other information contained herein, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company before purchasing the Common Stock offered hereby. Information contained in this Prospectus contains "forward-looking statements" which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "could," "intent," "estimated," "projected," "contemplated" or "anticipates" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. No assurance can be given that the future results covered by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. These statements, by their nature, involve substantial risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond the Company's control. The following factors and other factors described elsewhere in this Prospectus could cause actual experience to vary materially from the future results covered in such forward-looking statements. Other factors, such as regional and national economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, credit risks of lending activities, and competition and regulatory factors, could also cause actual experience to vary materially from the matters covered in such forward-looking statements.EXPOSURE TO LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS The Company's success is dependent to a significant extent upon general economic conditions in Florida, particularly south Florida. General economic conditions include such factors as the south Florida real estate market, inflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond the Company's control. The south Florida economy is susceptible to adverse effects resulting from adverse conditions in the south Florida real estate markets, a decline in tourism, or adverse economic conditions or recession in the national economy.Economic recession over a prolonged period or other economic dislocation in south Florida could cause increases in nonperforming assets, thereby causing operating losses, impairing liquidity and eroding capital. There can be no assurance that future adverse changes in the Florida economy would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.INTEREST RATE RISK The Company's earnings depend to a great extent on "rate differentials," which are the differences between interest income that the Company earns on interest-bearing assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings. Financial institutions, including the Bank, are affected by changes in general interest rate levels. Fluctuations in interest rates are not predictable or controllable. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the Company's control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various government and regulatory authorities. For example, actions taken by Federal Reserve Board can lead to changes in interest rates, which affect the Company's interest income, interest expense and investment portfolio.The nature, timing and effect of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies on the Company and its results of operations are not predictable. From time to time, maturities of assets and liabilities are not balanced, and a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the net interest margin and results of operations of the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience a material adverse effect on its net interest income in a changing rate environment. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- For the Years Ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 -- Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity."COMPETITION IN THE BANK'S MARKET AREAS Most of the financial institutions in the Bank's market areas have been in existence for significantly longer periods of time than the Bank and are better established in their market areas. Many of such competitors are larger in size and possess substantially greater financial and other resources than the Bank.There is currently a trend toward consolidation of the banking industry, which may make it more difficult for smaller banks to operate profitability. There can be no assurance that the Bank will be able to continue to compete successfully against larger institutions. See "BUSINESS -- Competition." 9 CHANGE IN COMPOSITION OF LOAN PORTFOLIO As part of the Company's change in focus from the transaction orientation of mortgage banking and residential lending to the relationship orientation of community banking, the Company has reduced its focus on the residential mortgage lending business and increased its commercial lending activity. While commercial business loans generally are made for shorter terms and at higher yields than one- to four-family residential loans, such loans generally involve a higher level of risk. The commercial loan risk of borrower default is greater than in owner-occupied residential property loans, since the collateral may be more difficult to liquidate and more likely to decline in value.REGULATION AND SUPERVISION Bank holding companies and banks operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to extensive supervision and examination by several federal and state regulatory agencies. The Company is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC"), and to regulation and supervision by theFederal Reserve Board. The Bank, as a Florida state bank, is subject to regulation and supervision by the Florida Department of Banking and Finance and, as a result of the insurance of its deposits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). These regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers, rather than for the benefit of investors. The Company and the Bank are subject to changes in federal and state laws, as well as changes in regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles. The effects of any potential changes cannot be predicted but could adversely affect the business and operations of the Company and the Bank in the future. See "Regulation and Supervision." The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a policy that requires a bank holding company such as the Company to serve as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board has required bank holding companies to contribute cash to their troubled bank subsidiaries based upon this "source of strength" policy, which could have the effect of decreasing funds available for distributions to shareholders. In addition, a bank holding company in certain circumstances could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary. See "Regulation and Supervision."DEPENDENCE ON KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL The Company's success depends to a significant extent upon the performance of its executive officers, the loss of any of whom could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. The Company has not, however, entered into employment agreements with, or obtained "key man" insurance for, its executive officers. The Company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to retain such personnel; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in doing so.RESTRICTIONS ON ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS The Company has not paid cash dividends on the Common Stock and at the present time the Company does not foresee paying cash dividends to shareholders and intends to retain all earnings to fund the growth of the Company and the Bank. Any declaration and payment of dividends on the Common Stock will depend upon the earnings and financial condition of the Company, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, the Company's ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the Common Stock and other factors deemed relevant by the Company's Board of Directors. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company's ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Company's principal source of funds to pay dividends on the shares ofCommon Stock will be cash dividends that the Company receives from the Bank. The payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal and state banking laws, regulations and authorities. Under Florida law, a state bank may not pay dividends from its capital. All dividends must be paid out of current net profits then on hand plus retained net profits of the preceding two years. See "Dividend Policy."Accordingly, 10 since the Bank had no net profits in either 1996 or 1995, in 1997 the Bank was unable to pay dividends to the Company. As of March 31, 1998, an aggregate of approximately $694,000 was available for payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company under applicable restrictions without regulatory approval. The Company's sole activity is holding all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of theBank and accordingly, the Company does not anticipate paying any dividends until it receives dividends from the Bank. See "Regulation and Supervision." The federal banking statutes prohibit federally insured banks from making any capital distributions (including a dividend payment) if, after making the distribution, the institution would be "undercapitalized" as defined by statute.In addition, the relevant federal regulatory agencies also have the authority to prohibit an insured bank from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice, as determined by the agency, in conducting an activity. The payment of dividends could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe and unsound practice, depending on the financial condition of the Bank. Regulatory authorities could impose administratively stricter limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company if such limits were deemed appropriate to preserve certain capital adequacy requirements. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Capital Resources" and "Regulation and Supervision."CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP; CONTROL BY MANAGEMENT After the consummation of the Offering, the executive officers and directors of the Company will beneficially own 27.70% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, and approximately 26.27% of such shares of Common Stock if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is fully exercised. Accordingly, these executive officers and directors will be able to influence, to a significant extent, the outcome of all matters required to be submitted to the Company's shareholders for approval, including decisions relating to the election of directors of the Company, the determination of day-to-day corporate and management policies of the Company and other significant corporate transactions.See "Management," "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" and "Description of Capital Stock." YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE Almost all of the Company's operations are supported by accounting and recordkeeping computerized systems and are dependent on the capability of software applications and operating systems to function properly in the year 2000. The Company has an ongoing program designed to ensure that its operational and financial systems will not be adversely affected by year 2000 software failures, due to processing errors arising from calculations using the year 2000 date. Based on current estimates, the Company expects to incur expenses of $50,000 over the next two years on its program to redevelop, replace, or repair its computer applications to make them "year 2000 compliant," and expects them to be so by July 1999. While the Company believes it is doing everything technologically possible to assure year 2000 compliance, it is to some extent dependent upon vendor cooperation. The Company is requiring its computer system and software vendors to represent that the products provided are, or will be, year 2000 compliant, and has planned a program of testing for compliance. While the Company believes that all essential computer applications will be year 2000 compliant and that the costs associated with year 2000 compliance will not be material to the Company, any year 2000 compliance failure could result in additional expense to the Company.NO PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET; VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE; NO GUARANTEE OF ACTIVE AND LIQUID TRADING MARKET Before the Offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock. The initial public offering price will be determined through negotiations between the Company and the Representatives of the Underwriters based on several factors that may not be indicative of future market prices. See "Underwriting" for a discussion of the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price. Although the Common Stock has been approved for quotation on Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that it will be actively traded on such market or that, if active trading does develop, it will be sustained. 11SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Upon consummation of the Offering, the Company will have 2,252,722 shares of Common Stock outstanding (2,383,157 if the over-allotment option granted to the Underwriters is exercised in full). Of these shares, 869,565 shares (1,000,000 shares if the over-allotment option granted to the Underwriters is exercised in full) together with 812,728 shares previously registered in connection with the Company's acquisition of the Bank and the Thrift, will be freely transferable without restriction or registration under the SecuritiesAct, unless purchased by persons deemed to be "affiliates" (as that term is defined under the Securities Act) of the Company. All of the remaining 570,429 shares of Common Stock will be "restricted securities," as that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. The Company and its executive officers and directors and certain of the Company's existing shareholders have agreed that they will not sell or otherwise transfer any shares of Common Stock for 180 days after the Offering without the prior written consent of theRepresentatives. Future sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for future sale, could impair the Company's ability to raise capital through an offering of securities and may adversely affect the then-prevailing market prices. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS Certain provisions of the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving the Company more difficult, even if such events could be perceived as beneficial to the interests of the stockholders. For example, the Company's Articles of Incorporation provide for classes of directors, whereby one-third of the members of the Board of Directors are elected each year and each director of the Company is to serve for a term of three years. In addition, options granted under the Company's stock option plan provide for accelerated vesting of such options in the event of a change in control of the Company. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging or prohibiting a future takeover attempt in which stockholders of the Company might otherwise receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-current market prices. See "Description of Capital Stock -- Certain Anti-TakeoverProvisions." REGULATION OF CONTROL Individuals or entities, alone or acting in concert with others, who acquire 10% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company are presumed to have acquired "control" of the Company under the Change in Bank Control Act, which requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any such acquisition. Entities, acting alone or through one or more other persons, seeking to acquire, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (5% or more in the case of an acquiror that is a bank holding company) of any class of voting securities of, or otherwise to control, the Company are required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC. Accordingly, prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with these requirements in connection with any purchase of shares of the Common Stock offered hereby.IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION Purchasers of Common Stock in the Offering will experience immediate dilution in net tangible book value of $3.875 per share, based on the initial public offering price of $15.375 per share. To the extent that any options to be granted with respect to the Common Stock are exercised, purchasers of CommonStock will experience additional dilution. See "Dilution" and "Management." 12</th>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks before investing in our common stock. these risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. you could lose part or all of your investment. risks relating to our businessesinterest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and profitability. our insurance and investment products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and expose us to the risk that falling interest rates will reduce our "spread," or the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under these products and the amounts that we must pay policyholders and contractholders. because we may reduce the interest rates we credit on most of these products only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because some of them have guaranteed minimum crediting rates, declines in interest rates may adversely affect the profitability of those products. for example, interest rates declined to unusually low levels from 2001 to 2003. during this period, our net earnings from spread-based products, such as fixed and income annuities and guaranteed investment contracts, declined from $207 million for the year ended december31, 2001 to $138 million for the year ended december31, 2003. during periods of increasing market interest rates, we must offer higher crediting rates on interest-sensitive products, such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities, and we must increase crediting rates on in-force products to keep these products competitive. in addition, increases in market interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans, as policyholders and contractholders seek to shift assets to products with perceived higher returns. increases in crediting rates, as well as surrenders and withdrawals, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. an increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals also may require us to accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition costs or other intangibles or cause an impairment of goodwill, which would reduce our net earnings. our long-term care insurance products also expose us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. the pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns. over time, long-term care insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums, which we invest as we receive them. declining interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and may adversely affect the profitability of our long-term care insurance products. in our mortgage insurance business, rising interest rates generally reduce the volume of new mortgages, resulting in a decrease in the volume of new insurance written. rising interest rates also can increase the monthly mortgage payments for insured homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages, or arms, which could have the effect of increasing default rates on arm loans and thereby increasing our exposure on our mortgage insurance policies. this is particularly relevant in our non-u.s. mortgage insurance business, where armsare the predominant mortgage product. declining interest rates increase the rate at which insured borrowers refinance their existing mortgages, thereby resulting in cancellations of the mortgage insurance covering the refinanced loans. declining interest rates also generally are associated with home price appreciation, which may provide insured borrowers the option of canceling their mortgage insurance coverage earlier than we anticipated in pricing that coverage. these cancellations could have an adverse effect on our results from our mortgage insurance business. interest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio. during periods of declining market interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases. in addition, during those periods, we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. issuers of fixed-income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates the risk that we may have to invest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower-yielding or lower-credit instruments. declining interest rates from 2001 to 2003 contributed to a decrease in our weighted average investment yield from 6.5% for the year ended december31, 2001 to 5.2% for the year ended december31, 2003. for additional information regarding our investment portfolio, see "businessinvestments." for additional information regarding the sensitivity of the fixed maturities in our investment portfolio to interest rate fluctuations, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risksensitivity analysis."downturns and volatility in equity markets could adversely affect our business and profitability. significant downturns and volatility in equity markets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in three principal ways. first, market downturns and volatility may cause potential new purchasers of our products to refrain from purchasing products, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance, that have returns linked to the performance of the equity markets and may cause current policyholders and contractholders to withdraw cash values from those products. the sharp declines in the equity markets during 2001 and 2002 have had adverse impacts on our sales of variable annuities and other products linked to equity markets. for example, our deposits for variable annuities decreased by 28% from $2,309million for the year ended december31, 2001 to $1,667million for the year ended december31, 2002. second, downturns and volatility in equity markets can have an adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our separate account and private asset management products and services. because these products depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, declines in the equity markets have reduced our revenues by reducing the value of the investment assets we manage. for example, the recent equity market downturn caused a reduction in the value of the separate account assets underlying our variable life insurance policies, variable annuities and assets under management. as a result, our policy fees and other income in our retirement income and investments segment decreased by 7% from $243million for the year ended december31, 2002 to $225million for the year ended december31, 2003. in addition, some of our variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum income payments tied to the investment performance of the assets held within the variable annuity. a significant market decline could result in declines in account values which could increase our payments under the guaranteed minimum death benefits and certain income payments in connection with variable annuities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. third, we are exposed to equity risk on our holdings of common stock and other equities. an economic downturn, corporate malfeasance or a variety of other factors could cause declines in the value of our equity portfolio and cause our net earnings to decline. for additional information regarding the sensitivity of the equity securities in our investment portfolio to equity market fluctuations, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risksensitivity analysis."defaults in our fixed-income securities portfolio may reduce our earnings. issuers of the fixed-income securities that we own may default on principal and interest payments. as of each of march31, 2004 and december31, 2003 and 2002, 93% of our fixed maturities had ratings equivalent to investment-grade. nevertheless, as a result of the economic downturn and recent corporate malfeasance, the number of companies defaulting on their debt obligations increased dramatically in 2001 and 2002. as of march31, 2004 and december31, 2003 and 2002, we had fixed maturities in or near default (where the issuer has missed payment of principal or interest or entered bankruptcy) with a fair value of $177million, $190million and $181million, respectively. an economic downturn, further events of corporate malfeasance or a variety of other factors could cause declines in the value of our fixed maturities porfolio and cause our net earnings to decline. we recognized gross capital gains of $27million, $181million, $473million, $790million and $814million for the three months ended march31, 2004 and 2003 and the years ended december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. we realized these capital gains in part to offset default-related losses during those periods. however, capital gains may not be available in the future, and if they are, we may elect not to recognize capital gains to offset losses.a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. financial strength ratings, which various ratings organizations publish as measures of an insurance company's ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintaining public confidence in our products, the ability to market our products and our competitive position. a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including: reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other investment products; adversely affecting our relationships with independent sales intermediaries and our dedicated sales specialists; materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders; requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance. in connection with our initial public offering and separation from ge, our principal life insurance companies were downgraded from financial strength ratings of "aa" (very strong) by s&p and "aa2" (excellent) by moody's, to "aa-" (very strong) and "aa3" (excellent), respectively. in addition, as a result of our 2003 decision to reduce excess capital at our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, our mortgage insurance companies were downgraded from financial strength ratings of "aaa" (extremely strong) by s&p and fitch and "aaa" (exceptional) by moody's to "aa" (very strong) by s&p and fitch and "aa2" (excellent) by moody's. although we do not believe that these downgrades have negatively affected our business overall in any material respect, we cannot assure you that they will not have an adverse effect over time or that our ratings will not be further downgraded in the future. the "aa" and "aa-" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of s&p's 21 ratings categories, respectively. the "aa2" and "aa3" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of moody's 21 ratings categories, respectively. the "aa" rating is the third-highest of fitch's 24 ratings categories. the charters of the federal national mortgage corporation, or fannie mae, and the federal home loan mortgage corporation, or freddie mac, only permit them to buy high loan-to-value mortgages that are insured by a "qualified insurer," as determined by each of them. their current rules effectively provide that they will accept mortgage insurance only from private mortgage insurers with financial strength ratings of at least "aa-" by s&p and "aa3" by moody's. if our mortgage insurance companies' financial strength ratings decrease below the thresholds established by fannie mae and freddie mac, we would not be able to insure mortgages purchased by fannie mae or freddie mac. approximately 69% and 68% of the loans we insured in the u.s. during the three months ended march31, 2004 and the year ended december31, 2003, respectively, were sold to either fannie mae or freddie mac. an inability to insure mortgage loans sold to fannie mae or freddie mac, or their transfer of our existing policies to an alternative mortgage insurer, would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in 2003, the u.s. office of federal housing enterprise oversight announced a risk-based capital rule that treats credit enhancements issued by private mortgage insurers with financial strength ratings of "aaa" more favorably than those issued by "aa" rated insurers. neither fannie mae nor freddie mac has adopted policies that distinguish between "aa" rated and "aaa" rated mortgage insurers. however, if fannie mae or freddie mac adopts policies that treat "aaa" rated insurers more favorably than "aa" rated insurers, our competitive position may suffer. our mortgage insurance subsidiaries in canada and australia are also subject to local regulations that require them to maintain specified financial strength ratings to continue their operations. in addition to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, ratings agencies also publish credit ratings for our company. the credit ratings have an impact on the interest rates we pay on the money we borrow. therefore, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are not evaluations directed to the protection of investors in our common stock. the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries described under "businessfinancial strength ratings" reflect each rating agency's current opinion of each subsidiary's financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders and contractholders. these factors are of concern to policyholders, contractholders, agents, sales intermediaries and lenders. ratings are not evaluations directed to the protection of investors in our common stock. they are not ratings of our common stock and should not be relied upon when making a decision to buy, hold or sell our shares of common stock or any other security. in addition, the standards used by rating agencies in determining financial strength are different from capital requirements set by state insurance regulators. we may need to take actions in response to changing standards set by any of the ratings agencies, as well as statutory capital requirements, which could cause our business and operations to suffer.if our reserves for future policy benefits and claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish reserve liabilities to provide for future obligations under our insurance policies, annuities and other investment products, and mortgage insurance contract underwriting arrangements. reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are estimates of expected net policy and contract benefits and claims payments over time. our reserving assumptions and estimates require significant judgments and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual benefit and claim payments, the timing of those payments, or whether the assets supporting our policy and contract liabilities will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of benefits or claims. we continually monitor our reserves. if we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claims payments, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. for more information on how we set our reserves, see "businessreserves."as a holding company, we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations. we will act as a holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and will not have any significant operations of our own. dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our tax sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries will be our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations. these obligations will include our operating expenses, interest and principal on debt and contract adjustment payments on our equity units. these obligations also include amounts we will owe to ge under the tax matters agreement that we and ge will enter into prior to the completion of this offering. if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets. the payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations. in general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed "extraordinary" and require insurance regulatory approval. see "regulation." during the years ended december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we received dividends from our insurance subsidiaries of $1,472million ($1,400million of which were deemed "extraordinary"), $840million ($375million of which were deemed "extraordinary") and $410million (none of which were deemed "extraordinary"), respectively. in addition, during the years ended december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we received dividends from insurance subsidiaries related to discontinued operations of $495million, $62million and $0, respectively. based on statutory results as of december31, 2003, our subsidiaries could pay dividends of $1,121million to us in 2004 without obtaining regulatory approval. however, as a result of the dividends we will pay in connection with our corporate reorganization, most of our insurance subsidiaries will not be able to pay us any additional dividends for the twelve months following this offering without prior regulatory approval. as part of our corporate reorganization, we will retain cash at the holding company level which we believe will be adequate to fund our dividend payments, debt service, obligations under the tax matters agreement and other obligations until our subsidiaries can resume paying dividends to us. in addition, the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, are subject to various conditions imposed by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings.some of our investments are relatively illiquid. our investments in privately placed fixed maturities, mortgage loans, policy loans, limited partnership interests, real estate and restricted investments held by securitization entities are relatively illiquid. these asset classes represented approximately 30% of the carrying value of our total cash and invested assets as of march31, 2004, on a pro forma basis. if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. for example, our floating rate funding agreements generally contain "put" provisions through which a contractholder may terminate the funding agreement for any reason after giving notice within the contract's specified notice period, which is generally 90days but can be less than 30days. as of march31, 2004, the aggregate amount of our outstanding funding agreements with put option features was approximately $2.4billion, and the aggregate amount of funding agreements with put option notice periods of 30days or less was $450million. if an unexpected number of contractholders exercise this right and we are unable to access other liquidity sources, we may have to liquidate assets quickly. our inability to quickly dispose of illiquid investments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability. our businesses are subject to intense competition. we believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of our products are product features, price, commission structure, marketing and distribution arrangements, brand, reputation, financial strength ratings and service. many other companies actively compete for sales in our protection and retirement income and investments markets, including other major insurers, banks, other financial institutions and specialty providers. the principal direct and indirect competitors for our mortgage insurance business include other private mortgage insurers, as well as federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies in the u.s., including the federal housing administration, or fha, and to a lesser degree, the veterans administration, or va, fannie mae and freddie mac, as well as local and state housing finance agencies. we also compete in our mortgage insurance business with structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to manage credit risk, such as credit default swaps and credit linked notes, with lenders who forego mortgage insurance, or self-insure, on loans held in their portfolios, and with lenders that provide mortgage reinsurance through captive mortgage reinsurance programs. in canada and some european countries, our mortgage insurance business competes directly with government entities, which provide comparable mortgage insurance. government entities with which we compete typically do not have the same capital requirements and do not have the same profit objectives as we do. although private companies, such as our company, establish pricing terms for their products to achieve targeted returns, these government entities may offer products on terms designed to accomplish social or political objectives or reflect other non-economic goals. in many of our product lines, we face competition from competitors that have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do. many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels. the substantial expansion of banks' and insurance companies' distribution capacities and expansion of product features in recent years have intensified pressure on margins and production levels and have increased the level of competition in many of our business lines.we may be unable to attract and retain independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists. we distribute our products through financial intermediaries, independent producers and dedicated sales specialists. we compete with other financial institutions to attract and retain commercial relationships in each of these channels, and our success in competing for sales through these sales intermediaries depends upon factors such as the amount of sales commissions and fees we pay, the breadth of our product offerings, the strength of our brand, our perceived stability and our financial strength ratings, the marketing and services we provide to them and the strength of the relationships we maintain with individuals at those firms. from time to time, due to competitive forces, we have experienced unusually high attrition in particular sales channels for specific products. our inability to continue to recruit productive independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists, or our inability to retain strong relationships with the individual agents at our independent sales intermediaries, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.if the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to the derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks default, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we use reinsurance and derivative instruments to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. we cannot assure you that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverable owed to us now or in the future or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. a reinsurer's insolvency or inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. prior to the completion of this offering, we will cede to uflic, effective as of january1, 2004, policy obligations under our structured settlement contracts, which had reserves of $12.0billion, and our variable annuity contracts, which had general account reserves of $2.8billion and separate account reserves of $7.9billion, in each case as of december31, 2003. these contracts represent substantially all of our contracts that were in force as of december31, 2003 for these products. in addition, effective as of january1, 2004, we will cede to uflic policy obligations under a block of long-term care insurance policies that we reinsured from travelers, which had reserves of $1.5billion as of december31, 2003. uflic has agreed to establish trust accounts for our benefit to secure its obligations under the reinsurance arrangements, and general electric capital corporation, an indirect subsidiary of ge, or ge capital, has agreed to maintain uflic's risk-based capital above a specified minimum level. if uflic becomes insolvent notwithstanding this agreement, and the amounts in the trust accounts are insufficient to pay uflic's obligations to us, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. see "arrangements between ge and our companyreinsurance transactions." in addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various business risks. we enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate and currency swaps and options to enter into interest rate and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. if our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. that failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and international securities markets could negatively affect our profitability. our international operations generate revenues denominated in local currencies. for the three months ended march31, 2004 and 2003, and the years ended december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, 20%, 16%, 18%, 14% and 14% of our revenues, and 32%, 23%, 26%, 12% and 11% of our net earnings from continuing operations were generated by our international operations. we generally invest cash generated by our international operations in securities denominated in local currencies. as of each of march31, 2004 and december31, 2003 and 2002, approximately 5% of our invested assets were held by our international operations and were invested primarily in non-u.s.-denominated securities. although investing in securities denominated in local currencies limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results, we remain exposed to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates as we translate the operating results of our foreign operations into our combined financial statements. we currently do not hedge this exposure, and as a result, period-to-period comparability of our results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. for example, our net earnings for the three months ended march31, 2004 and the year ended december31, 2003, included approximately $12million and $25million, respectively, due to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. in addition, because we derive a significant portion of our earnings from non-u.s.-denominated revenue, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent the dollar value of non-u.s.-denominated revenue is reduced due to a strengthening u.s. dollar. in addition, our investments in non-u.s.-denominated securities are subject to fluctuations in non-u.s. securities and currency markets, and those markets can be volatile. non-u.s. currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to their parent companies in the u.s. for additional information regarding the sensitivity of our net earnings to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risksensitivity analysis."our insurance businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. state insurance laws regulate most aspects of our u.s. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. our non-u.s. insurance operations are regulated principally by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled. state laws in the u.s. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; mandating certain insurance benefits; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; approving changes in control of insurance companies; restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners, or naic, regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. changes in these laws and regulations are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our mortgage insurance business is subject to additional laws and regulations. for a discussion of the risks associated with those laws and regulations, see "risks relating to our mortgage insurance businesschanges in regulations that affect the mortgage insurance business could affect our operations significantly and could reduce the demand for mortgage insurance." currently, the u.s. federal government does not regulate directly the business of insurance. however, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. these areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. in addition, legislation has been introduced in the u.s. senate, which, if ena</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the following risk factors and the other information contained in this prospectus before you decide to purchase our common stock. additional risks that are not currently known or foreseeable to us may materialize at a future date. the trading price of our common stock could decline if any of these risks or uncertainties occur and you might lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our businesswe have a history of operating losses and we expect to continue to incur losses and may never be profitable. as of september 30, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $225.1million. we had net losses of $53.0 million and $60.4 million for the nine month period september 30, 2006 and the year ended december 31, 2005, respectively. we have had operating losses since inception as a result of our significant clinical development, research and development, general and administrative, sales and marketing and business development expenses. we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years as we expand our sales and marketing capabilities and continue our clinical trials and research and development activities. our prospects for achieving profitability will depend primarily on how successful we are in executing our business plan to: market and sell zanaflex capsules; obtain fda approval for and commercialize fampridine-sr; continue to develop our preclinical product candidates and advance them into clinical trials; and enter into strategic partnerships and collaboration arrangements related to our drug discovery programs and product candidates. if we are not successful in executing our business plan, we may never achieve or may not sustain profitability.we will be substantially dependent on sales of one product, zanaflex capsules, to generate revenue for the foreseeable future. we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets, which are our only fda-approved products. although we currently distribute zanaflex tablets, our marketing efforts are focused on zanaflex capsules and we do not, and do not intend to, actively promote zanaflex tablets. as a result, prescriptions for zanaflex tablets have declined and we expect that they will continue to decline. our goal is to convert sales of zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets to sales of zanaflex capsules. we believe that sales of zanaflex capsules will constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. if we are unable to convert tablet sales to capsule sales or are otherwise unable to increase our revenue from the sale of this product, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.if we are unable to successfully differentiate zanaflex capsules from both zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets we may not be able to increase sales of zanaflex capsules. there are currently 12 companies with generic versions of tizanidine tablets on the market and they are significantly cheaper than either zanaflex capsules or zanaflex tablets. as of september 30, 2006, these generic versions of tizanidine tablets constituted approximately 95% of tizanidine sales in the unitedstates. although zanaflex capsules have a different pharmacokinetic profile when taken with food 6 and are available in a higher dose than zanaflex tablets and their generic equivalents, we may be unsuccessful in convincing prescribers, patients and third-party payors that these differences justify the higher price of zanaflex capsules. prescribers may prescribe generic tizanidine tablets instead of zanaflex capsules, and third-party payors may establish unfavorable reimbursement policies for zanaflex capsules or otherwise seek to encourage patients and prescribers to use generic tizanidine tablets instead of zanaflex capsules. in addition, although the fda has determined that neither zanaflex tablets nor generic tizanidine tablets are equivalent, or ab-rated, to zanaflex capsules, pharmacists may improperly fill prescriptions with generic tizanidine tablets or may seek to influence patients or physicians to change prescriptions from zanaflex capsules to generic tizanidine tablets. if we are unable to successfully differentiate zanaflex capsules from zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets in the minds of prescribers, pharmacists, patients and third-party payors, our ability to generate meaningful revenue from this product will be adversely affected.our company has limited sales and marketing experience and we may not be successful in building an effective sales and marketing organization to market zanaflex capsules to specialty physicians. as a company, we have limited sales and marketing experience, having only launched zanaflex capsules in april2005. in order to successfully commercialize zanaflex capsules or any other products that we may bring to market, we will need to have adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. although we intend to increase our sales force from 32 to 65 persons, we may not be able to attract, train and retain skilled sales and marketing personnel, in a timely manner or at all, or integrate and manage a growing sales and marketing organization. in addition, we may not succeed in increasing our sales of zanaflex capsules sufficiently to justify the expense associated with our expanded sales force, which would adversely affect our cash flow and our prospects for achieving profitability. we had initially planned to target potential high-prescribing primary care physicians through contract sales representative companies, cardinal health pts, llc and innovex, inc., that had been hired to provide sales representatives targeting the primary care market. we now intend to address that market through our expanded sales force. there can be no assurances that our sales force will be effective in reaching the primary care market.our product candidates must undergo rigorous clinical testing, the results of which are uncertain and could substantially delay or prevent us from bringing them to market. before we can obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we must undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda and other regulatory agencies. clinical trials of new product candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensive and take years to complete, and the outcome of such trials is uncertain. clinical development of any product candidate that we determine to take into clinical trials may be curtailed, redirected, delayed or eliminated at any time for some or all of the following reasons: negative or ambiguous results regarding the efficacy of the product candidate; undesirable side effects that delay or extend the trials, or other unforeseen or undesirable safety issues that make the product candidate not medically or commercially viable; inability to locate, recruit and qualify a sufficient number of patients for our trials; difficulty in determining meaningful end points or other measurements of success in our clinical trials; regulatory delays or other regulatory actions, including changes in regulatory requirements; 7 difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of the product candidate manufactured under current good manufacturing practices; delays, suspension or termination of the trials imposed by us, an independent institutional review board for a clinical trial site, or clinical holds placed upon the trials by the fda; fda approval of new drugs that are more effective than our product candidates; change in the focus of our development efforts or a re-evaluation of our clinical development strategy; and a change in our financial position. a delay in or termination of any of our clinical development programs could have an adverse effect on our business.if any additional studies required by the fda for fampridine-sr do not yield favorable results or we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for fampridine-sr, or any approval is unduly limited in scope or delayed, our business prospects will be adversely affected. in september 2006, we announced positive results from our phase 3 clinical trial of fampridine-sr for the improvement of walking in patients with ms, which was performed under a spa from the fda. although statistical significance was achieved on all three efficacy criteria defined in the spa, typically, positive results from at least one other clinical trial are needed to support the filing of an nda with the fda. based on our december 2006 meeting with the fda, we will design and conduct an additional phase 3 trial of fampridine-sr in people with ms. in addition, we will execute a qt safety cardiac study in accordance with the fdas october 2005 guidance, clinical evaluation of qt/qtc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for non-antiarrhythmic drugs. we cannot predict how long these two studies, or any additional studies that might be required by the fda, will take or what the cost will be. in addition, if the fda determines that a new substantial scientific issue regarding the safety or efficacy of fampridine-sr is identified, the fda may alter its conclusion, expressed in the spa, regarding the adequacy of the phase 3 protocol. the fda may also identify a need for studies in addition to the second phase3 trial and the qt safety cardiac study to confirm efficacy that would examine safety or other properties or characteristics of the drug. notwithstanding the results of our clinical trials, the fda could determine that the overall balance of risks and benefits for fampridine-sr is not adequate to support approval, or only justifies approval for a narrow set of uses or approval with restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements and limitations. if the fda denies approval of fampridine-sr in ms, if fda approval is substantially delayed, if approval is granted on a narrow basis or with restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements, or if the fampridine-sr program is terminated, our business prospects will be adversely affected. in march2004, we completed two phase 3 clinical trials of fampridine-sr in sci in which our results failed to reach their primary endpoints. we may resume development of fampridine-sr for sci after we have completed further development of the drug for ms. we cannot predict whether future clinical trials of fampridine-sr in sci will achieve their primary endpoints, how long these clinical trials will take or how much they will cost.our other drug development programs are in early stages of development and may never be commercialized. all of our development programs other than fampridine-sr are in the preclinical phase. our future success depends, in part, on our ability to select successful product candidates, complete preclinical development of these product candidates and advance them to clinical trials. these product candidates will 8 require significant development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory clearances and substantial additional investment before they can be commercialized. our preclinical programs may not lead to commercially viable products for several reasons. for example, we may fail to identify promising product candidates, our product candidates may fail to be safe and effective in preclinical tests or clinical trials, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue discovery and development efforts for new product candidates. in addition, because we have limited resources, we are focusing on product candidates that we believe are the most promising. as a result, we may delay or forego pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates. from time to time, we may establish and announce certain development goals for our product candidates and programs; however, given the complex nature of the drug discovery and development process, it is difficult to predict accurately if and when we will achieve these goals. if we are unsuccessful in advancing our preclinical programs into clinical testing or in obtaining regulatory approval, our long-term business prospects will be harmed.the pharmaceutical industry is subject to stringent regulation and failure to obtain regulatory approval will prevent commercialization of our product candidates. our research, development, preclinical and clinical trial activities, as well as the manufacture and marketing of any products that we may successfully develop, are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the fda and other regulatory agencies abroad. the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals for drugs is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and any regulatory approvals may contain limitations on the indicated usage of a drug, distribution restrictions or may be conditioned on burdensome post-approval study or other requirements, including the requirement that we institute and follow a special risk management plan to monitor and manage potential safety issues, all of which may eliminate or reduce the drugs market potential. post-market evaluation of a product could result in marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market. the results of preclinical and phase 1 and phase 2 clinical studies are not necessarily indicative of whether a product will demonstrate safety and efficacy in larger patient populations, as evaluated in phase3 clinical trials. additional adverse events that could impact commercial success, or even continued regulatory approval, might emerge with more extensive post-approval patient use. of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an nda to the fda and even fewer are approved for commercialization. in order to conduct clinical trials to obtain fda approval to commercialize any product candidate, an ind application must first be submitted to the fda and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. subsequently, an nda must be submitted to the fda, including the results of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating, among other things, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in humans for each target indication. in addition, the manufacturing facilities used to produce the products must comply with current good manufacturing practices and must pass a pre-approval fda inspection. extensive submissions of preclinical and clinical trial data are required to demonstrate the safety, efficacy, potency and purity for each intended use. the fda may refuse to accept our regulatory submissions for filing if they are incomplete. clinical trials are subject to oversight by institutional review boards and the fda to ensure compliance with the fdas good clinical practice requirements, as well as other requirements for the protection of clinical trial participants. we depend, in part, on third-party laboratories and medical institutions to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials for our products and other third-party organizations to perform data collection and analysis, all of which must maintain both good laboratory and good clinical practices required by regulators. if any such standards are not complied with in our clinical trials, the resulting data from the clinical trial may not be usable or we, an institutional review board or the 9 fda may suspend or terminate such trial, which would severely delay our development and possibly end the development of such product candidate. we also depend upon third party manufacturers of our products to qualify for fda approval and to comply with good manufacturing practices required by regulators. we cannot be certain that our present or future manufacturers and suppliers will comply with current good manufacturing practices. the failure to comply with good manufacturing practices may result in the termination of clinical studies, restrictions in the sale of, or withdrawal of the products from the market. compliance by third parties with these standards and practices is outside of our direct control. in addition, we are subject to regulation under other state and federal laws, including requirements regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and may be subject to other local, state, federal and foreign regulations. we cannot predict the impact of such regulations on us, although it could impose significant restrictions on our business and additional expenses to comply with these regulations.our products and product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenue. market acceptance of our products and product candidates will depend on the benefits of our products in terms of safety, efficacy, convenience, ease of administration and cost effectiveness and our ability to demonstrate these benefits to physicians and patients. we believe market acceptance also depends on the pricing of our products and the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors, as well as on the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities. physicians may not prescribe our products, and patients may determine, for any reason, that our products are not useful to them. for example, physicians may not believe that the benefits of zanaflex capsules outweigh their higher cost in relation to zanaflex tablets or generic tizanidine tablets. the failure of any of our products or product candidates, once approved, to achieve market acceptance would limit our ability to generate revenue and would adversely affect our results of operations.our potential products may not be commercially viable if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for these products by medicaid, medicare or other third-party payors. our commercial success will depend in part on third-party payors, such as government health administrative authorities, including medicaid and medicare, private health insurers and other such organizations, agreeing to reimburse patients for the cost of our products. significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly-approved healthcare products. our business would be materially adversely affected if the medicaid program, medicare program or other third-party payors were to deny reimbursement for our products or provide reimbursement only on unfavorable terms. our business could also be adversely affected if the medicaid program, medicare program or other reimbursing bodies or payors limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed to a smaller set of indications than we believe is appropriate. third-party payors frequently require that drug companies negotiate agreements with them that provide discounts or rebates from list prices. at present we do not have any such agreements with private third-party payors and only a small number of such agreements with government payors. if sales of zanaflex capsules increase we may need to offer larger discounts or discounts to a greater number of third-party payors to maintain acceptable reimbursement levels. if we were required to negotiate such agreements, there is no guarantee that we would be able to negotiate them at price levels that are profitable to us, or at all. if we are unsuccessful in maintaining reimbursement for our products at acceptable levels, our business will be adversely affected. in addition, if our competitors reduce the prices of their products, or otherwise demonstrate that they are better or more cost effective than our products, this may result in a greater level of reimbursement for their products relative to our products, which would reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations. we may experience pressure to lower prices on our approved products due to new and/or proposed federal legislation. federal legislation enacted in december2003 added an outpatient prescription drug benefit to medicare, effective january2006. the benefit is provided primarily through private entities, which attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. these negotiations increase pressure to lower prescription drug prices. while the new law specifically prohibits the u.s. government from interfering in price negotiations between manufacturers and medicare drug plan sponsors, some members of congress are pursuing legislation that would permit the u.s. government to use its enormous purchasing power to demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies, thereby creating de facto price controls on prescription drugs. in addition, the new law contains triggers for congressional consideration of cost containment measures for medicare in the event medicare cost increases exceed a certain level. these cost containment measures could include limitations on prescription drug prices. this medicare prescription drug coverage legislation, as well as additional healthcare legislation that may be enacted at a future date, could reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations.if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or more convenient than our approved products, or obtain marketing approval before we obtain approval of future products, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated. competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense and is expected to increase. composition of matter patents on tizanidine, the active ingredient in zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets, expired in 2002. as of september30, 2006, there were currently 12 companies with generic versions of tizanidine tablets on the market. to the extent that we are not able to differentiate zanaflex capsules from zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets and/or pharmacists improperly substitute generic tizanidine tablets when filling prescriptions for zanaflex capsules, we may be unable to convert additional sales of zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets to zanaflex capsules and our ability to generate revenue from this product will be adversely affected. although no other fda-approved capsule formulation of tizanidine exists, another company could develop a capsule or other formulation of tizanidine that competes with zanaflex capsules. many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are involved in research and/or product development for various neurological diseases, including ms and sci. we are aware of a company developing a sodium/potassium channel blocker and a second company developing an immediate release form of fampridine, both of which may compete with fampridine-sr, if approved. in certain circumstances, pharmacists are not prohibited from formulating certain drug compounds to fill prescriptions on an individual patient basis. we are aware that at present compounded fampridine is used by some people with ms or sci and it is possible that some people will want to continue to use compounded formulations even if fampridine-sr is approved. several companies are engaged in developing products that include novel immune system approaches and cell transplant approaches to remyelination for the treatment of people with ms. these programs are in early stages of development and may compete in the future with fampridine-sr or our preclinical candidates. our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective, safer or more convenient than our products or the ones we have under development or that render our approved or proposed products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. in addition, our competitors may achieve product commercialization before we do. if any of our competitors develops a product that is more effective, safer or more convenient for patients, or is able to obtain fda approval for commercialization before we do, we may not be able to achieve market acceptance for our products, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and recover the substantial development costs we have incurred and will continue to incur. 11 our products may be subject to competition from lower-priced versions of such products and competing products imported into the united states from canada, mexico and other countries where there are government price controls or other market dynamics that make the products lower priced.our operations could be curtailed if we are unable to obtain any necessary additional financing on favorable terms or at all. on september 30, 2006, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to our private placement in october2006, we would have approximately $48.2million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. although we anticipate this will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our financial obligations through the first quarter of 2008 based on our current projected revenue and spending levels, we have several product candidates in various stages of development, and all will require significant further investment to develop, test and obtain regulatory approval prior to commercialization. we will likely need to seek additional equity or debt financing or strategic collaborations to continue our product development activities, and could require substantial funding to commercialize any products that we successfully develop. we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all. to the extent that we are able to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of those securities would result in dilution to our stockholders. holders of such new equity securities may also have rights, preference or privileges that are senior to yours. if additional capital is raised through the incurrence of indebtedness, we may become subject to various restrictions and covenants that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, provide for unanticipated capital investments or take advantage of business opportunities. to the extent funding is raised through collaborations or intellectual property-based financings, we may be required to give up some or all of the rights and related intellectual property to one or more of our products, product candidates or preclinical programs. if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms when and if needed, we may be required to reduce, defer or discontinue one or more of our product development programs or devote fewer resources to marketing zanaflex capsules.under our financing arrangement with the paul royalty fund, or prf, upon the occurrence of certain events, prf may require us to repurchase the right to receive revenues that we assigned to it or may foreclose on certain assets that secure our obligations to prf. any exercise by prf of its right to cause us to repurchase the assigned right or any foreclosure by prf could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition. on december23, 2005, we entered into a revenue interests assignment agreement with prf, which was amended on november28, 2006, pursuant to which we assigned to prf the right to receive a portion of our net revenues from zanaflex capsules, zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products. to secure our obligations to prf, we also granted prf a security interest in substantially all of our assets related to zanaflex. under our arrangement with prf, upon the occurrence of certain events, including if we experience a change of control, undergo certain bankruptcy events, transfer any of our interests in zanaflex (other than pursuant to a license agreement, development, commercialization, co-promotion, collaboration, partnering or similar agreement), transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or breach certain of the covenants, representations or warranties under the revenue interests assignment agreement, prf may (i)require us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it at the put/call price in effect on the date such right is exercised or (ii)foreclose on the zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to prf. except in the case of certain bankruptcy events, if prf exercises its right to cause us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it, prf may not foreclose unless we fail to pay the put/call price as required. the put/call price on a given date is the greater of (i)150% of all payments made by prf to us as of such date, less all payments received by prf from us as of such date, and (ii)an amount that would generate an internal rate of return to prf of 12 25% on all payments made by prf to us as of such date, taking into account the amount and timing of all payments received by prf from us as of such date. if prf were to exercise its right to cause us to repurchase the right we assigned to it, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available to pay the put/call price in effect at that time. even if we have sufficient funds available, we may have to use funds that we planned to use for other purposes and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. if prf were to foreclose on the zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to prf, our results of operations and financial condition could also be adversely affected. because prfs right to cause us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it is triggered by, among other things, a change in control, transfer of any of our interests in zanaflex (other than pursuant to a license agreement, development, commercialization, co-promotion, collaboration, partnering or similar agreement) or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, the existence of that right could discourage us or a potential acquirer from entering into a business transaction that would result in the occurrence of any of those events.the loss of our key management and scientific personnel may hinder our ability to execute our business plan. our success depends on the continuing contributions of our management team and scientific personnel, and maintaining relationships with our scientific and medical network and the network of centers in the united states and canada that conducts our clinical trials. we are highly dependent on the services of dr.ron cohen, our president and chief executive officer, as well as the other principal members of our management and scientific staff. our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. we face intense competition in our hiring efforts with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations, and we may have to pay higher salaries to attract and retain qualified personnel. with the exception of dr.ron cohen, we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on the lives of our officers, directors or employees. the loss of one or more of our key employees, or our inability to attract additional qualified personnel, could substantially impair our ability to implement our business plan.we face an inherent risk of liability in the event that the use or misuse of our products results in personal injury or death. if the use or misuse of zanaflex capsules or any other fda-approved products we may sell in the future harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, third-party payors or others. the use of our product candidates in clinical trials could also expose us to product liability claims. we currently maintain a product liability insurance policy that includes coverage of our clinical trials. this insurance policy has a $10million per claim limit and the aggregate amount of claims under the policy is also capped at $10million. we cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result from the use of our products or the testing of product candidates and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we currently have may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or defense costs we might incur. a product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could give rise to a substantial liability that could exceed our resources. even if claims are not successful, the costs of defending such claims and potential adverse publicity could be harmful to our business. we are subject to various federal and state laws regulating the marketing of zanaflex capsules and, if we do not comply with these regulations, we could face substant</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS An investment in the Common Stock offered hereby involves a high degree of risk, including the risks described below. In addition to the other information contained herein, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company before purchasing the Common Stock offered hereby. Information contained in this Prospectus contains "forward-looking statements" which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "could," "intent," "estimated," "projected," "contemplated" or "anticipates" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. No assurance can be given that the future results covered by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. These statements, by their nature, involve substantial risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond the Company's control. The following factors and other factors described elsewhere in this Prospectus could cause actual experience to vary materially from the future results covered in such forward-looking statements. Other factors, such as regional and national economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, credit risks of lending activities, and competition and regulatory factors, could also cause actual experience to vary materially from the matters covered in such forward-looking statements.EXPOSURE TO LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS The Company's success is dependent to a significant extent upon general economic conditions in Florida, particularly south Florida. General economic conditions include such factors as the south Florida real estate market, inflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond the Company's control. The south Florida economy is susceptible to adverse effects resulting from adverse conditions in the south Florida real estate markets, a decline in tourism, or adverse economic conditions or recession in the national economy.Economic recession over a prolonged period or other economic dislocation in south Florida could cause increases in nonperforming assets, thereby causing operating losses, impairing liquidity and eroding capital. There can be no assurance that future adverse changes in the Florida economy would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.INTEREST RATE RISK The Company's earnings depend to a great extent on "rate differentials," which are the differences between interest income that the Company earns on interest-bearing assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings. Financial institutions, including the Bank, are affected by changes in general interest rate levels. Fluctuations in interest rates are not predictable or controllable. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the Company's control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various government and regulatory authorities. For example, actions taken by Federal Reserve Board can lead to changes in interest rates, which affect the Company's interest income, interest expense and investment portfolio.The nature, timing and effect of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies on the Company and its results of operations are not predictable. From time to time, maturities of assets and liabilities are not balanced, and a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the net interest margin and results of operations of the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience a material adverse effect on its net interest income in a changing rate environment. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- For the Years Ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 -- Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity."COMPETITION IN THE BANK'S MARKET AREAS Most of the financial institutions in the Bank's market areas have been in existence for significantly longer periods of time than the Bank and are better established in their market areas. Many of such competitors are larger in size and possess substantially greater financial and other resources than the Bank.There is currently a trend toward consolidation of the banking industry, which may make it more difficult for smaller banks to operate profitability. There can be no assurance that the Bank will be able to continue to compete successfully against larger institutions. See "BUSINESS -- Competition." 9 CHANGE IN COMPOSITION OF LOAN PORTFOLIO As part of the Company's change in focus from the transaction orientation of mortgage banking and residential lending to the relationship orientation of community banking, the Company has reduced its focus on the residential mortgage lending business and increased its commercial lending activity. While commercial business loans generally are made for shorter terms and at higher yields than one- to four-family residential loans, such loans generally involve a higher level of risk. The commercial loan risk of borrower default is greater than in owner-occupied residential property loans, since the collateral may be more difficult to liquidate and more likely to decline in value.REGULATION AND SUPERVISION Bank holding companies and banks operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to extensive supervision and examination by several federal and state regulatory agencies. The Company is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC"), and to regulation and supervision by theFederal Reserve Board. The Bank, as a Florida state bank, is subject to regulation and supervision by the Florida Department of Banking and Finance and, as a result of the insurance of its deposits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). These regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers, rather than for the benefit of investors. The Company and the Bank are subject to changes in federal and state laws, as well as changes in regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles. The effects of any potential changes cannot be predicted but could adversely affect the business and operations of the Company and the Bank in the future. See "Regulation and Supervision." The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a policy that requires a bank holding company such as the Company to serve as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board has required bank holding companies to contribute cash to their troubled bank subsidiaries based upon this "source of strength" policy, which could have the effect of decreasing funds available for distributions to shareholders. In addition, a bank holding company in certain circumstances could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary. See "Regulation and Supervision."DEPENDENCE ON KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL The Company's success depends to a significant extent upon the performance of its executive officers, the loss of any of whom could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. The Company has not, however, entered into employment agreements with, or obtained "key man" insurance for, its executive officers. The Company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to retain such personnel; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in doing so.RESTRICTIONS ON ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS The Company has not paid cash dividends on the Common Stock and at the present time the Company does not foresee paying cash dividends to shareholders and intends to retain all earnings to fund the growth of the Company and the Bank. Any declaration and payment of dividends on the Common Stock will depend upon the earnings and financial condition of the Company, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, the Company's ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the Common Stock and other factors deemed relevant by the Company's Board of Directors. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company's ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Company's principal source of funds to pay dividends on the shares ofCommon Stock will be cash dividends that the Company receives from the Bank. The payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal and state banking laws, regulations and authorities. Under Florida law, a state bank may not pay dividends from its capital. All dividends must be paid out of current net profits then on hand plus retained net profits of the preceding two years. See "Dividend Policy."Accordingly, 10 since the Bank had no net profits in either 1996 or 1995, in 1997 the Bank was unable to pay dividends to the Company. As of March 31, 1998, an aggregate of approximately $694,000 was available for payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company under applicable restrictions without regulatory approval. The Company's sole activity is holding all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of theBank and accordingly, the Company does not anticipate paying any dividends until it receives dividends from the Bank. See "Regulation and Supervision." The federal banking statutes prohibit federally insured banks from making any capital distributions (including a dividend payment) if, after making the distribution, the institution would be "undercapitalized" as defined by statute.In addition, the relevant federal regulatory agencies also have the authority to prohibit an insured bank from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice, as determined by the agency, in conducting an activity. The payment of dividends could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe and unsound practice, depending on the financial condition of the Bank. Regulatory authorities could impose administratively stricter limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company if such limits were deemed appropriate to preserve certain capital adequacy requirements. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Capital Resources" and "Regulation and Supervision."CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP; CONTROL BY MANAGEMENT After the consummation of the Offering, the executive officers and directors of the Company will beneficially own 27.70% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, and approximately 26.27% of such shares of Common Stock if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is fully exercised. Accordingly, these executive officers and directors will be able to influence, to a significant extent, the outcome of all matters required to be submitted to the Company's shareholders for approval, including decisions relating to the election of directors of the Company, the determination of day-to-day corporate and management policies of the Company and other significant corporate transactions.See "Management," "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" and "Description of Capital Stock." YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE Almost all of the Company's operations are supported by accounting and recordkeeping computerized systems and are dependent on the capability of software applications and operating systems to function properly in the year 2000. The Company has an ongoing program designed to ensure that its operational and financial systems will not be adversely affected by year 2000 software failures, due to processing errors arising from calculations using the year 2000 date. Based on current estimates, the Company expects to incur expenses of $50,000 over the next two years on its program to redevelop, replace, or repair its computer applications to make them "year 2000 compliant," and expects them to be so by July 1999. While the Company believes it is doing everything technologically possible to assure year 2000 compliance, it is to some extent dependent upon vendor cooperation. The Company is requiring its computer system and software vendors to represent that the products provided are, or will be, year 2000 compliant, and has planned a program of testing for compliance. While the Company believes that all essential computer applications will be year 2000 compliant and that the costs associated with year 2000 compliance will not be material to the Company, any year 2000 compliance failure could result in additional expense to the Company.NO PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET; VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE; NO GUARANTEE OF ACTIVE AND LIQUID TRADING MARKET Before the Offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock. The initial public offering price will be determined through negotiations between the Company and the Representatives of the Underwriters based on several factors that may not be indicative of future market prices. See "Underwriting" for a discussion of the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price. Although the Common Stock has been approved for quotation on Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that it will be actively traded on such market or that, if active trading does develop, it will be sustained. 11SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Upon consummation of the Offering, the Company will have 2,252,722 shares of Common Stock outstanding (2,383,157 if the over-allotment option granted to the Underwriters is exercised in full). Of these shares, 869,565 shares (1,000,000 shares if the over-allotment option granted to the Underwriters is exercised in full) together with 812,728 shares previously registered in connection with the Company's acquisition of the Bank and the Thrift, will be freely transferable without restriction or registration under the SecuritiesAct, unless purchased by persons deemed to be "affiliates" (as that term is defined under the Securities Act) of the Company. All of the remaining 570,429 shares of Common Stock will be "restricted securities," as that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. The Company and its executive officers and directors and certain of the Company's existing shareholders have agreed that they will not sell or otherwise transfer any shares of Common Stock for 180 days after the Offering without the prior written consent of theRepresentatives. Future sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for future sale, could impair the Company's ability to raise capital through an offering of securities and may adversely affect the then-prevailing market prices. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS Certain provisions of the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving the Company more difficult, even if such events could be perceived as beneficial to the interests of the stockholders. For example, the Company's Articles of Incorporation provide for classes of directors, whereby one-third of the members of the Board of Directors are elected each year and each director of the Company is to serve for a term of three years. In addition, options granted under the Company's stock option plan provide for accelerated vesting of such options in the event of a change in control of the Company. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging or prohibiting a future takeover attempt in which stockholders of the Company might otherwise receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-current market prices. See "Description of Capital Stock -- Certain Anti-TakeoverProvisions." REGULATION OF CONTROL Individuals or entities, alone or acting in concert with others, who acquire 10% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company are presumed to have acquired "control" of the Company under the Change in Bank Control Act, which requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any such acquisition. Entities, acting alone or through one or more other persons, seeking to acquire, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (5% or more in the case of an acquiror that is a bank holding company) of any class of voting securities of, or otherwise to control, the Company are required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC. Accordingly, prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with these requirements in connection with any purchase of shares of the Common Stock offered hereby.IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION Purchasers of Common Stock in the Offering will experience immediate dilution in net tangible book value of $3.875 per share, based on the initial public offering price of $15.375 per share. To the extent that any options to be granted with respect to the Common Stock are exercised, purchasers of CommonStock will experience additional dilution. See "Dilution" and "Management." 12</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. investing in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. any of the following factors could harm our business and future results of operations and could result in a partial or complete loss of your investment. these risks are not the only ones that we may face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations and hinder our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders. risks related to our business and properties our initial portfolio of properties, together with our three option properties, are all located in greater washington, d.c. and any downturn in the areas economy may negatively affect our operating results. all of our initial properties and option properties are located in greater washington, d.c. as a result of this geographic concentration, we are exposed to greater economic risks than if we owned a more geographically-diverse portfolio of properties. in addition, nine of our 10 initial properties are located in northern virginia, a real estate market which we believe has only recently emerged from a period of higher vacancy and lower rental rates, as compared to historical rates. greater washington, d.c., and more specifically, northern virginia, is distinguished by a high concentration of professional service firms, technology and telecommunications companies, federal and local government agencies and various trade groups and associations. adverse economic developments affecting one or more of these groups, including decreased procurement spending by the u.s. government, outsourcing, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, businesses relocations, changing demographics, acts of terrorism, infrastructure quality, increases in real estate and other taxes, costs associated with government regulations or increased regulation, and other factors, including the potential for decreased u.s. government leasing in greater washington, d.c. as a result of the department of defenses recently adopted base realignment and closure initiative, may significantly affect the occupancy, rental rates and value of our properties, which may negatively affect our results of operations.the consideration paid by us for the properties and other rights being contributed to us as part of the formation transactions may exceed the fair market value of these assets. we have not obtained recent third-party appraisals of the 10 properties in our initial portfolio. the amount of consideration we will pay in exchange for these 10 properties and the other rights being contributed as part of the formation transactions is based on managements estimate of fair market value, including an analysis of market sales comparables, market capitalization rates for other properties and general market conditions for such properties. the amount of consideration we will pay was not determined as a result of arms-length negotiations and managements estimate of fair market value has not been approved by our independent trustee nominees and may exceed the appraised fair market value of these assets, if an appraisal were obtained. in addition, some of our executive officers and trustees, who had significant influence in structuring the formation transactions, had pre-existing ownership interests in the properties and rights to be contributed to us in the formation transactions and will receive substantial economic benefits as a result of these transactions. these executive officers and trustees, in the course of structuring the formation transactions, had the ability to influence the type and level of benefits that they and our other executive officers and trustees will receive from us. we depend on a limited number of significant tenants and a payment delinquency, bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more of these tenants could adversely affect the income produced by our properties, which may harm our operating performance. we are dependent on a limited number of significant tenants at our properties. our 10 largest tenants represented approximately 65.6% of our total annualized rent for all leases in which tenants were in occupancy as of november1, 2005. in particular, our largest tenant, the u.s. department of justice, represented approximately 22.5% of our total annualized rent for all leases in which tenants were in occupancy as of november1, 2005. the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more of our tenants may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. if a tenant defaults on a lease with us, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights. if a tenant files for bankruptcy, we cannot evict the tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. a bankruptcy court, however, could authorize a tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. in such case, our claim against the tenant for unpaid rent would be subject to a statutory limit that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease. under any circumstances, it is unlikely that a bankrupt tenant will pay, in full, amounts owed to us under a lease. the loss of rental payments from tenants and the costs of re-leasing may adversely affect our cash flows and operating results, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.if one or more of our tenants with early termination rights terminates their lease with us and we are unable to secure a replacement tenant on at least as favorable terms, our cash flows and operating results would be adversely impacted. several of our tenants lease space from us under leases that afford these tenants the right to terminate those leases, in whole or in part, prior to the scheduled expiration of the leases. these tenants lease an aggregate of approximately 231,840 net rentable square feet from us with a total annualized rent of approximately $5.6million, or approximately 13.1% of our total annualized rent, as of november1, 2005. additionally, four of our 22 leases in which tenants occupy more than 25,000 net rentable square feet have early termination provisions that typically allow the tenant to terminate its lease with us during the seventh or eighth year of a 10-year lease. if one or more of our tenants with early termination rights terminates its lease and we are unable to secure a replacement tenant on at least as favorable terms, our operating results, cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or meet our financial obligations would be adversely affected.we may be unable to renew existing leases or re-let space on terms similar to the existing leases, or at all, as leases expire, or we may expend significant capital in our efforts to re-let space, which may harm our operating performance. leases representing approximately 7.9% of our net rentable square feet (or annualized rent of approximately $4.4 million) at our properties will expire before december31, 2006, assuming no exercise of earlyterminationrights.inaddition,we believe that approximately 65% of the rent being paid under those leases expiring before december31, 2006 is currently at above-market rental rates. we may not be able to renew leases with our existing tenants or we may be unable to re-let space to new tenants if our current tenants do not renew their leases. even if our tenants renew their leases or we are able to re-let the space, the terms and other costs of renewal or re-letting, including the cost of required renovations, increased tenant improvement allowances, leasing commissions, declining rental rates and other potential concessions, may be less favorable or more costly than the terms of our current leases or than we anticipate and could require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. if we are unable to renew leases or re-let space in a reasonable time, or if rental rates decline or tenant improvement, leasing commissions or other costs increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our future growth is dependent on the acquisition of our three option properties and our growth may be harmed if our option agreements are terminated upon a change in control of our company or our independent trustees do not approve an acquisition of one or more of the option properties. we have entered into agreements with entities affiliated with some of our executive officers and trustees (contributors) granting us the option to acquire properties representing an estimated 1.1million net rentable square feet of office space. the terms of these agreements allow us to purchase a property during a period beginning from the receipt of a certificate of occupancy and continuing until 60 days prior to the maturity (including any extensions) of any construction loans on the property. in addition, in the event we do not exercise our initial option on a property, and the property is not sold to a third party, we have a second option to purchase a property during the period beginning 180 days after the expiration of the initial option and continuing through the fourth anniversary of the receipt of the propertys certificate of occupancy. currently, only the portals iii and republic square i are under development and we cannot assure you when these properties or republic square ii will receive their certificates of occupancy, if at all. the development of republic squareii depends upon the successful build out and lease-up of republic squarei and any delays or difficulties encountered may delay the possible exercise of our options and therefore harm our growth. our growth is dependent on our ability to acquire these three properties. in addition, the option agreements contain provisions which permit the seller to terminate an agreement if a change in control of our company occurs. our ability to acquire these properties, therefore, is subject to several risks, including that one or more of the properties is not ultimately developed, that the option is terminated upon a change in control and that our independent trustees do not approve our acquisition of one or more of the properties. our purchase of any of these three properties could subject us to a number of additional risks, including our inability to meet expected occupancy and rent levels, if at all. in addition, any purchase by us of an option property may involve the issuance of op units, which would have a dilutive impact on the holders of our common shares and op units. in evaluating whether or not to acquire an option property, we may make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property and may underestimate the costs associated with achieving full occupancy of the newly-acquired property. our operating flexibility and ability to sell any of the option properties that we may later acquire may be economically prohibited by certain tax protection obligations. in connection with the option properties, we have agreed with the property owners that if we exercise the option with respect to a property and dispose of an interest in that property in a taxable transaction within ten years of our exercise of the option to acquire that property, then we will indemnify the property owners and their direct and indirect owners for their tax liabilities attributable to the built-in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of the exercise of the option (as well as the tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment). although it may be in our shareholders best interest that we sell a property, it may be economically prohibitive for us to do so because of these obligations.certain of our trustees and executive officers, and their affiliates, have substantial ownership interests in our three option properties and these interests may conflict with your interests. mr.kramer, our chairman of the board, mr.keller, our chief executive officer, and mr.grigg, our president and chief development officer, and their affiliates, have substantial ownership interests in the three option properties over which we have options to acquire described under business and propertiesdevelopment. although any decisions regarding whether or not to purchase these properties in the future will be made by a vote of our independent trustees, we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by conflicts arising from messrs.kramer, grigg and kellers existing and ongoing economic interest in these properties. in particular, these conflicts could cause messrs.kramer, grigg and keller to divert their time and attention away from focusing on our business in an effort to enhance the value of the option properties for which they will receive direct and significant compensation upon exercise of our option. we face competition when pursuing fee-based development opportunities and our inability to capture these opportunities could negatively impact our growth and profitability. we selectively seek fee-based development opportunities for all real estate classes where we feel we can strengthen our position and prominence in a particular area or foster new investment and development opportunities. we face competition when pursuing these opportunities and these competitors may have more established contacts in a particular geographic region or more expertise in the development of real estate asset classes other than office properties. our inability to capture fee-based development opportunities could negatively impact our growth and profitability. in addition, we do not possess the same level of familiarity with the development of properties outside of greater washington,d.c., which could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties successfully, or at all, or to achieve expected performance.when providing fee-based development services, our right to receive fees for development services is typically subordinate to the rights of other creditors in connection with the construction of the property and as a result we may not be able to timely collect development fees, if at all, which could harm our operating results. as part of our growth strategy, we seek fee-based development opportunities for all real estate classes in various geographic areas both inside and outside of greater washington, d.c. typically, our right to receive fees for development services is subordinate to the rights of third-party creditors providing construction loans for the project. for example, the development services agreement entered into between us and the owner of republic square i provides that our rights to receive development fees are subordinate to the rights and interests of the lender under a construction loan agreement. as a result of these types of subordination provisions, we may be unable to collect fees earned by us for the development and construction of a project in a timely fashion, if at all, if a default under the construction loans has occurred or the creditor providing the construction loans has otherwise not been repaid, which could harm our results of operations. if we do not obtain or lose the right to provide fee-based development services for the city center project in the city of west palm beach, florida, our cash flows and operating results may be negatively impacted. as part of the formation transactions, republic properties corporation will contribute to us the right it currently has to provide fee-based development services to the city of west palm beach, florida to design, develop and construct an urban mixed-use development known as city center. our issuance of opunits to republic properties corporation in exchange for the contribution of its rights under the city center project is not contingent on the ultimate development of the project. the city of west palm beach city commission has recently considered the status of the project and while they voted to proceed with further development of plans and budgets, these plans and budgets have not been approved. in addition, the city of west palm beach must consent to the transfer of the rights to us and we are currently in the process of pursuing this required consent. if the city of west palm beach elects to abandon, or otherwise terminate, the project prior to the execution of final documentation, or if they do not consent to the transfer by republic properties corporation of their rights to us, we would lose the right to provide development services in connection with the project, which may have a negative impact on our cash flows and operating results.if we lose our right to provide management services on an outsource basis for the portals properties, our cash flows and operating results will be negatively impacted. as part of the formation transactions, we have entered into agreements with messrs.kramer and grigg and republic properties corporation, each general partners of pda, pursuant to which we will provide, on an outsource basis, management and development services for the portals properties in exchange for receiving a portion of the management or development fee, as the case may be, that is 26 payable to messrs.kramer and grigg and republic properties corporation with respect to each property. messrs.kramer and grigg and republic properties corporation, as general partners of pda, together with another unaffiliated general partner of pda, currently receive a fee for the management of the portals i and ii properties and a development fee for the portals iii. because our agreements to provide management and development services to the portals properties are with messrs.kramer and grigg and republic properties corporation and not with the entities that own the portals properties, we are not in privity of contract with these entities and do not have a direct right to enforce our agreements with these entities. accordingly, if pdas right to provide these services to the portals properties is terminated for any reason (whether or not we are at fault), we would lose our right to provide those management and/or development services to one or more of the portals properties, which would negatively impact our cash flows and operating results.we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions of office and office-oriented mixed-use properties meeting our criteria, which may impede our growth and negatively impact the price of our common shares. our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets or in consummating acquisitions on satisfactory terms, if at all. our ability to acquire office and office-oriented mixed-use properties on favorable terms may be constrained by competition from other investors with significant capital, including other publicly-traded reits and institutional investors. competition from these other potential acquirers may result in increased bidding, which may ultimately increase the price we must pay for a property or may result in us being unable to acquire a property at all. for example, we have acquired all but one of our initial properties in privately negotiated transactions outside of a competitive bidding process. if we are unable to continue to attract, negotiate and consummate these types of private transactions, we may be forced to expend substantial resources in acquiring properties in a competitive bidding process, if at all. failure to identify or consummate suitable acquisitions could cause us to grow at a slower rate than expected, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and reduce the price of our common shares.if we are not successful in efficiently integrating and operating the properties we acquire, managements attention may be diverted away from our day-to-day operations and we may experience other disruptions which could harm our results of operations. we will be required to integrate properties we acquire into our existing portfolio. the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated, because, for example, we do not realize anticipated operational or geographical synergies, which may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from our day-to-day operations, which could harm our results of operations.acquired properties may expose us to unknown liabilities which could harm our growth and future operations. we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities, such as liabilities to the government, tenants, third-party creditors, vendors or other persons, liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by parties entitled to be indemnified by the former owners of the properties. as a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon our ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle any such claim, which could harm our growth and future operations and result in a lowering of the price of our common shares. we face significant competition, which may impede our ability to retain tenants or re-let space when existing tenants vacate. we face significant competition for tenants in our properties from owners and operators of office and office-oriented mixed-use properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in greater washington, d.c. these competitors may possess greater expertise or flexibility in designing space to meet prospective tenants needs or may be more willing to make space available to prospective tenants at lower prices than comparable spaces in our properties, which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge these tenants.our operating results will be harmed if we are unable to fully lease-up vacant space at properties, such as presidents park i and ii, which were underperforming at the time we acquired them. as part of our acquisition strategy, we have acquired, and may in the future acquire, properties, such as presidents park i and ii, which we believe will result in favorable risk-adjusted returns on our investment but that have high vacancy rates upon acquisition. for example, presidents park i and ii were 20.3% occupied at the time we acquired these properties in december2004. these recently acquired properties may impede our operating performance and may take longer to achieve our anticipated investment return, if at all. costs associated with the lease-up of a recently acquired property may be higher than anticipated and, if achieved, may take longer to reach than we expect. to the extent our costs are higher than anticipated or we fail to lease these properties on favorable terms, or at all, we may not be able to lease-up the property, which may harm our operating results.future terrorist attacks in greater washington, d.c. could significantly impact the demand for, and value of, our properties. all of our initial properties and properties over which we have an option to acquire are located in greater washington, d.c., which has, in recent years, been a high risk geographical area for terrorism and threats of terrorism. future terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred on september11, 2001, and other acts of terrorism or war would severally impact the demand for, and value of, our properties. terrorist attacks in and around greater washington, d.c. could also directly impact the value of our properties through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs, and could thereafter materially impact the availability or cost of insurance to protect against such acts. a decrease in demand could make it difficult to renew or re-lease our properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates. to the extent that any future terrorist attacks otherwise disrupt our tenants businesses, it may impair their ability to make timely payments under their existing leases with us which would harm our operating results.uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow. we carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties and appropriate given the relative risk of loss and the cost of the coverage. some risks to our properties, such as losses due to terrorism, earthquakes or floods, are insured subject to policy limits which may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses. if we experience a loss which is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. in addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. in response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of september11, 2001, the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 (tria) was enacted in november2002 to mandate that insurance carriers offer insurance covering physical damage from terrorist incidents certified by the u.s. government as foreign terrorist acts. under tria, insurance carriers have a per occurrence deductible of $0.1 million and retain responsibility for 10% of the cost of each nuclear, chemical and biological certified event up to a maximum of $50million per occurrence. if the certified terrorism event is not found to be a 28 nuclear, chemical or biological event, the 10% exposure is limited to the $0.1 million deductible. the u.s. government is obligated to cover the remaining 90% of the loss above the deductible up to $100billion in the aggregate annually. our current insurance policy includes coverage for certified acts of terrorism, as governed by tria, and contains no specific exclusions specific to non-certified acts of terrorism. tria was originally set to expire on december31, 2004, which date was extended to december31, 2005 by the u.s. department of treasury on june18, 2004. on november 18, 2005, the u.s. senate passed the terrorism insurance extension act which, if passed into law, would extend tria until december 31, 2007. in its current form, the legislation reduces the amount of coverage that the u.s. government is required to provide and raises the deductibles for insurance carriers. such legislation may subsequently result in increased premiums charged by insurance carriers for terrorism insurance. while we cannot currently anticipate the final result of such legislation, we intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable. since the limit with respect to our portfolio may be less than the value of the affected properties, terrorist acts could result in property damage in excess of our coverage, which could result in significant losses to us due to the loss of capital invested in the property, the loss of revenues from the impacted property and the capital that would have to be invested in that property. any such circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations.if in the future we elect to make joint venture investments, we could be adversely affected by a lack of sole decision-making authority, reliance on joint venture partners financial condition and any disputes that might arise between us and our joint venture partners. we may invest in the future with third parties through joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, joint venture or other entity. in such event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, joint venture or other entity. investments in joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. likewise, partners may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. such investments may also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, because neither we nor our partner would have full control over the joint venture or other entity. disputes between us and partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and effort on our business. consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk. in addition, we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our partners. risks related to our debt financingrequired payments of principal and interest on our loan obligations may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations. required repayments of debt and related interest can adversely affect our operating performance. on a pro forma basis at september30, 2005, after this offering and the formation transactions, we expect to have approximately $230.0million of outstanding indebtedness, 100% of which will be secured. since we anticipate that our internally generated cash will be adequate to repay only a portion of our indebtedness prior to maturity, we expect that we will be required to repay debt through refinancings and/or public offerings. any offering of our equity securities to repay a portion of our indebtedness would result in the dilution of your ownership interest in us. the amount of our existing indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to repay debt through refinancing. if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties 29 on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us and which might adversely affect cash available for distributions to our shareholders. if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates on refinancing, our interest expense would increase, which could adversely affect our operating results. we also intend to incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions of real estate. we may, in some instances, borrow new funds to acquire properties. in addition, we may incur or increase our mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by some or all of the properties we acquire. we may also borrow funds if necessary to satisfy the requirement that we distribute to shareholders as distributions at least 90% of our annual taxable income (including net capital gains) and to avoid corporate level tax on our net taxable income, or otherwise as is necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. our substantial debt may harm our business and operating results, including by: requiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to pay interest, which reduces the amount available for distributions; placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions; and limiting our ability to borrow more money for operations, capital expenditures or to finance acquisitions in the future. our existing mortgage indebtedness contains, and any future mortgage indebtedness will contain, covenants that restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our existing mortgage indebtedness contains, and any future mortgage indebtedness may contain, certain covenants that apply to the property financed and our subsidiary that owns the property financed, which, among other things,

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE HAVE A HISTORY OF NET LOSSES AND MAY NEVER BECOME PROFITABLE We commenced operations in 1996 and are still in an early stage of development. We have not commercialized any products and we have incurred significant losses to date. As of June 30, 2000, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $18.3 million. To date, our revenues have been solely from collaborations and government grants. Our expenses have consisted principally of costs incurred in research and development and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We have incurred net losses since our inception, including a net loss of approximately $6.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. We expect our expenses to increase and to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts for our drug candidates. The amount of time necessary to successfully commercialize any of our drug candidates is long and uncertain and successful commercialization may not occur at all. As a result, we may never become profitable. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONSBased on our current plans, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and investments, together with the net proceeds of this offering, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements through at least the next 24 months. However, the actual amount of funds that we will need during or after the next 24 months will be determined by many factors, including those discussed in this section. If additional funds are required and we are unable to obtain them on terms favorable to us, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs or to license third parties to develop or market products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop or market ourselves. If we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted. IF WE DON'T ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER PARTIES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE DELAYED OR STOPPEDBecause we do not currently possess the financial and other resources necessary to develop potential products that may result from our technologies, or the financial and other resources to complete any approval processes which may be required for these products, we must enter into collaborative arrangements to develop many of our drug candidates. If we do not maintain or further extend our current collaboration with The R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute and Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc., both Johnson & Johnson companies, which expires on December 28, 2001, or if we do not enter into new collaborative agreements, then our revenues will be reduced, and our drug candidates may not be developed, manufactured or marketed. OUR POTENTIAL PRODUCTS ARE IN AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL EFFORT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR DEVELOPMENTOur technologies are new and our drug candidates are in the early stage of development. We may not develop products that prove to be safe and effective, meet applicable regulatory standards, are capable of being manufactured at reasonable costs, or can be marketed successfully. All of the potential proprietary products that we are currently developing will require significant development and investment, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing before we can submit any application for regulatory approval. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our 7 products, we must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that our drug candidates are safe and effective in humans. We have not commenced clinical testing of any of our potential products, nor have we submitted any application to test any potential products in humans. Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more. The length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the drug candidate. Our clinical trials, when commenced, may be suspended at any time if we or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, believe the patients participating in our studies are exposed to unacceptable health risks. We may encounter problems in our studies which will cause us or the FDA to delay or suspend the studies. Our commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including: - ineffectiveness of the study compound, or perceptions by physicians that the compound is not effective for a particular indication; - inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of compounds for use in clinical trials; - failure of the FDA to approve our clinical trial protocols; - slower than expected rate of patient recruitment; - unforeseen safety issues; or - government or regulatory delaysIf any future clinical trials are not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. ANY INABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies and products in the United States and other countries. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate our competitive advantage. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these foreign countriesThe patent positions of biotechnology companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We will apply for patents covering both our technologies and drug candidates as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or products in a timely fashion or at all, and in any event, the applications we do file may be challenged and may not result in issued patents. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies. In addition, others may challenge or invalidate our patents, or our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages. If the use or validity of any of our patents is ever challenged, resulting in litigation or administrative proceedings, we would incur substantial costs and the diversion of management in defending the patent. In addition, we generally do not control the patent prosecution of technology that we license from others. Accordingly, we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we would over technology we ownWe rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. We have taken measures to protect our proprietary information. These measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information. We seek to protect our proprietary 8 information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborators, and consultants. Nevertheless, employees, collaborators, or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT WOULD REQUIRE US TO SPEND TIME AND MONEY AND COULD PREVENT US FROM DEVELOPING OR COMMERCIALIZING PRODUCTSOur commercial success depends in part on not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties and not breaching any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and products. The biotechnology industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may have been issued relevant patents or may have filed relevant patent applications that could affect our ability to obtain patents or to operate as we would like to in our research, development, and commercialization efforts. If we wish to use technologies claimed by third parties in issued and unexpired patents, then we may need to obtain license(s) from the owner(s) of such patent(s), enter into litigation, or incur the risk of litigation. Litigation or failure to obtain necessary licenses may impede our ability to obtain collaborations or to develop our products and could prevent us or our collaborators from developing or commercializing our productsOther biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have filed patent applications and obtained patents, and in the future will likely continue to file patent applications and obtain patents, claiming polyketide synthase genes, gene fragments, and methods for modifying such genes or gene fragments. If these patents are valid or if these applications issue into valid patents, we will have to either circumvent the claims in these patents, or obtain licenses to use the patented technology in order to use these genes or technologies in the research, development and commercialization of our products and technologies. If we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring licenses to these patents, our ability to research, develop or commercialize products may be blockedThird parties may sue us in the future to challenge our patent rights or claim infringement of their patents. An adverse determination in litigation to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to license disputed rights from third parties or require us to cease using the disputed technologyWe are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies and families of compounds filed by, and issued to, third parties. If any of our competitors have filed patent applications or have been granted patents claiming inventions also claimed by us, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the relevant patent regulatory agency to determine priority of invention and, thus, the right to a patent for these inventions in the United States. Such a proceeding could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable. For example, a number of companies have cloned polyketide synthase genes and described in patents or publications technology to modify those genes or express them in heterologous hosts using recombinant DNA technology. Such companies include, for example, Abbott Laboratories (erythromycin, niddamycin); Dow Agrosciences (spinosyn); Eli Lilly and Company (tylosin, spiramycin), Novartis (soraphen, epothilone); and Merck (avermectin, lovastatin). Even if successful on priority grounds, an interference may result in loss of claims based on patentability grounds raised in the interference. Although patent and intellectual property disputes in the biotechnology area are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. 9 Third parties may obtain patents in the future and then claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. This is because patent applications in the United States are secret until issued into corresponding patents and the applications can be pending for several years after filing. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims or enforcing our patents against others. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize, and sell products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to: - pay damages; - stop using our products or methods; - develop non-infringing products or methods; and - obtain one or more licenses from third partiesWe may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. In that event, we could encounter substantial delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products, which we may not be able to accomplish. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH THROUGH RECRUITING AND RETAINING SKILLED EMPLOYEES AND EXPAND OUR MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVE OUR CONTROLS AND SYSTEMS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE OUR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONSWe have experienced a period of rapid and substantial growth that has placed, and if this growth continues will further place, a strain on our human and capital resources. If we are unable to manage this growth effectively, then our losses could increase. The number of our employees increased from 21 on December 31, 1997 to 62 on June 30, 2000. Retaining our current employees and recruiting qualified scientific personnel to perform future research and development work will be critical to our success. Competition is intense for experienced scientists, and we may not be able to retain or recruit sufficient skilled personnel to allow us to pursue collaborations and develop our products and core technologies to the extent otherwise possible. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, such as our two co-founders, the loss of whose services would adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Although we maintain and are the beneficiary of $1.0 million key-man life insurance policies for the lives of each of our two co-founders, Dr. Daniel Santi, our chief executive officer, and Dr. Chaitan Khosla, a director and consultant, we do not believe the proceeds would be adequate to compensate us for their lossOur ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to expand our management and improve our controls and systems. If we are unable to successfully implement these expansions and improvements, then we may not be able to effectively manage our day-to-day operations. WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND ACADEMIC GROUPSWe face, and will continue to face, intense competition from organizations such as large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies, that are pursuing competing technologies for modifying DNA. These organizations may develop technologies that are superior alternatives to our technologies. Further, our competitors in the polyketide gene engineering field may be more effective at implementing their technologies to develop commercial products. Some of these competitors have entered into collaborations with leading companies within our target markets to produce polyketides for commercial purposes. 10 Any products that we develop through our technologies will compete in multiple, highly competitive markets. Development of pharmaceutical products requires significant investment and resources. Many of the organizations competing with us in the markets for such products have greater capital resources, research and development and marketing staffs, facilities and capabilities, and greater experience in modifying DNA, obtaining regulatory approvals, and product manufacturing and marketing. Accordingly, our competitors may be able to develop technologies and products more easily, which would render our technologies and products and those of our collaborators obsolete and noncompetitive. IF WE FACE CLAIMS IN CLINICAL TRIALS OF A DRUG CANDIDATE, THESE CLAIMS WILL DIVERT OUR MANAGEMENT'S TIME AND WE WILL INCUR LITIGATION COSTSWe face an inherent business risk of clinical trial liability claims in the event that the use or misuse of our potential products results in personal injury or death. We may experience clinical trial liability claims if our drug candidates are misused or cause harm before regulatory authorities approve them for marketing. We currently do not maintain clinical trial liability insurance coverage. Even if we do obtain an insurance policy, it may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us. Clinical trial liability insurance is expensive, difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, because litigation related to these claims would strain our financial resources in addition to consuming the time and attention of our management. If we are sued for any injuries caused by our products, our liability could exceed our total assets. WE USE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS AND RADIOACTIVE AND BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS IN OUR BUSINESS. ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO IMPROPER HANDLING, STORAGE, OR DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS COULD BE TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLYOur research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Some of these materials may be novel, including bacteria with novel properties and bacteria that produce biologically active compounds. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials. We believe that our current operations comply in all material respects with these laws and regulations. We could be subject to civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, we could be sued for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties or our collaborators of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development, or commercialization efforts. WE HAVE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE CHARTER DOCUMENTS THAT MAY RESULT IN OUTCOMES WITH WHICH YOU DO NOT AGREEOur board of directors will have the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of those shares without further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for third parties to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stockOur certificate of incorporation will provide for staggered terms for the members of the board of directors and prevent our stockholders from acting by written consent. These provisions and other provisions of our bylaws and of Delaware law applicable to us could delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. This could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions. 11 SOME OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS CAN EXERT CONTROL OVER US, AND MAY NOT MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL STOCKHOLDERSAfter this offering, our officers, directors and principal stockholders (greater than 5% stockholders) will together control approximately 47.0% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of us and might affect the market price of our common stock, even when a change may be in the best interests of all stockholders. In addition, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements which we would not otherwise consider. RISKS RELATED TO THE OFFERING OUR STOCK PRICE COULD BE VOLATILE AND YOUR INVESTMENT COULD SUFFER A DECLINE IN VALUEThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: - announcements of technological developments in research by us or our competitors; - delay or failure in initiating, conducting, completing or analyzing clinical trials or unsatisfactory design or results of these trials; - achievement of regulatory approvals; - new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors; - changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; - announcements of departures or departures of key personnel; and - sales of our common stockIn addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq National Market and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. If this type of litigation were instituted against us, we would be faced with substantial costs and management's attention and resources would be diverted, which could in turn seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. WE EXPECT THAT OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL FLUCTUATE, AND THIS FLUCTUATION COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE, CREATING INVESTOR LOSSESOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline. Some of the factors which could cause our operating results to fluctuate include: - expiration of research contracts with collaborators or government research grants, which may not be renewed or replaced; - the success rate of our discovery efforts leading to milestones and royalties; 12 - the timing and willingness of collaborators to commercialize our products; and - general and industry specific economic conditions, which may affect our collaborators' research and development expendituresA large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed, including expenses for facilities, equipment, and personnel. Accordingly, if revenues decline or do not grow due to expiration of research contracts or government research grants, failure to obtain new contracts or other factors, we may not be able to correspondingly reduce our operating expenses. In addition, we expect operating expenses to continue to increase. Failure to achieve anticipated levels of revenues could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal periodDue to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. Our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. In that case, our stock price would probably decline. FUTURE SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY DEPRESS OUR STOCK PRICEThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the closing of this offering or the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. There will be 23,844,539 shares of common stock outstanding immediately after this offering, or 24,594,539 shares if the representatives of the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. The shares sold in this offering will be freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, except for any shares purchased by our affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act. 18,844,539 shares of common stock outstanding will be restricted securities as defined in Rule 144. Of these shares, 16,449,285 shares will be subject to a lock-up agreement providing that the stockholder will not offer, sell, or otherwise dispose of any of the shares of common stock owned by them for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus. These shares may be sold on the 181st day after the date of this prospectus without registration under the Securities Act to the extent permitted by Rule 144 or other exemptions under the Securities Act. Lehman Brothers Inc. may, in its sole discretion, at any time without notice, release all or any portion of the shares subject to the lock-up agreements, which would result in more shares being available for sale in the public market at an earlier date. In addition, as soon as practicable after the date of this prospectus, we intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8 with the Commission covering 3,502,107 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our 1996 stock option plan, our 2000 employee stock purchase plan and our 2000 non-employee director stock option plan. Sales of common stock by existing stockholders in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." AS A NEW INVESTOR, YOU WILL EXPERIENCE IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTIONIf you purchase shares of our common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution of $9.99 per share in pro forma net tangible book value. If the holders of outstanding options exercise those options, you will incur further dilution. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience additional substantial dilution. See "Dilution." 13</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of the following risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the related notes. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSSES IN THE PAST AND EXPECT FUTURE LOSSES We have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of $3.2 million in 1997, $5.1 million in 1998 and $2.2 million in the first quarter of 1999. As of March 31, 1999, our accumulated deficit was $13.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and, as a result, we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability We cannot assure you that we will achieve sufficient revenue for profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we cannot assure you that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate, or if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON AT&T FOR A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR REVENUE AND A DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM AT&T WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS We have an exclusive relationship with AT&T through which AT&T pays us for a variety of goods and services, including: - memberships provided free to students with an AT&T calling card, - marketing services, - advertising in our media products, such as our Web site and SAM, the Student Advantage magazine, and - sponsorship of certain of our products and services, such as the Virtual BackpackIn 1997, we derived $2.4 million, or 62%, of our total revenue from AT&T. In 1998, we derived $11.8 million, or 68%, of our total revenue from AT&T. In the first quarter of 1999, we derived $2.9 million, or 69%, of our total revenue from AT&T. Our relationship with AT&T has accounted for most of our members to date. We obtain these members as a result of AT&T's distribution of free Student Advantage memberships to students who enroll for an AT&T telecommunications service. In addition, most of our commerce revenue is currently attributable to fees that we earn from AT&T for obtaining completed calling card applications from students. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in expanding our membership base independent of our relationship with AT&TThe termination dates of our current agreements with AT&T have been extended until June 2001. However, AT&T may terminate these agreements upon 120 days' prior notice, subject to payment of a termination fee in certain cases. In addition, AT&T can terminate the current agreements if Raymond V. Sozzi, Jr. is no longer employed as our president, or if he no longer owns at least five percent of our capital stock. The termination of our relationship with AT&T would have a material adverse effect on our business. 7 9 WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND MAY FACE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY EARLY STAGE COMPANIES IMPLEMENTING AN INTERNET STRATEGY We have a limited operating history on which an investor can evaluate our business. Our operations began in 1992. An investor in our common stock must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies implementing an Internet strategy. These risks include our possible inability to: - sustain historical revenue growth rates, - generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability, - implement our business model, - maintain the satisfaction of our members, - introduce new and enhanced Web and offline content, products and services, and - respond to competitive developmentsIf we do not successfully manage these risks, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will successfully address these risks or that our business strategy will be successful. OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER We are highly dependent on our president and chief executive officer, Raymond V. Sozzi, Jr., the loss of whom would adversely affect our future success. If Mr. Sozzi is no longer employed as our president, AT&T can terminate its agreements with us. OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AT&T COULD HINDER OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL SPONSORS Our agreement with AT&T prevents us from providing our goods and services to other telecommunications companies. Our agreement with AT&T also precludes us from entering into a relationship with another sponsor that will distribute our memberships free to students as an incentive or through any promotion. Our relationship with AT&T could hinder our ability to attract additional national sponsors, in particular sponsors who may be interested in purchasing memberships for distribution to students. WE MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR INTERNET STRATEGY In order to successfully implement our Internet strategy, we must: - establish our Web site as the primary vehicle for delivery of our products and services, including member registration and renewal, information regarding national and local sponsors, and customer service, - expand our Web site to include more content and services for students and encourage our members to use the site so that it becomes more attractive for advertisers, and - establish our Web site as an effective e-commerce platformOur failure to successfully implement our Internet strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM ONLINE ACTIVITIES AND INTERNET ADVERTISING IS UNCERTAIN It is unclear whether companies implementing an Internet community business model will generate sufficient revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. Our ability to generate significant revenues from advertisers, sponsors and other businesses in connection with online activities will depend, in part, on our ability to generate sufficient user traffic with demographic characteristics attractive to our advertisers. The intense competition among Web sites that sell online advertising has led to the creation of a number of pricing alternatives for online advertising. These alternatives make it difficult for us to project future levels 8 10 of advertising and other Internet-related revenue and applicable gross margins related to our online offerings that can be sustained by us or the online advertising industry in general. Although we do not currently derive a substantial portion of our revenue from Internet advertising and other Internet-related activities, our business model depends in part on increasing the amount of such revenue. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS Our operating results are dependent upon the college student market and we expect them to vary seasonally based upon the typical school year. We tend to sell most of our memberships in the beginning of the fall and winter academic terms. All of these memberships expire on August 31 of each year. Because the aggregate number of memberships within a school year increases as new members are added beginning on September 1, and we recognize revenue from memberships ratably over the period from the time of subscription until the end of our membership year, our subscription revenue will typically be higher in the first and second quarters than in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. It is difficult to determine how the third quarter will typically compare, since it includes two calendar months from the end of a membership year and the first month of the subsequent membership yearOur limited operating history and rapid growth make it difficult for us to more fully assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business. Nevertheless, because our business is dependent upon the student market, we expect that our other revenue may be subject to seasonal fluctuations associated with the typical school year. In particular, other revenue can be expected to be higher during the third and fourth quarters due to increased activity associated with the commencement of the school year. Conversely, the second quarter may have the least amount of other revenue since it includes the months at the end of a school yearIn 1998, our other revenue was higher in the third and fourth quarters than in other quarters due in part to the seasonality factor noted above and in part to the commencement of activities under the AT&T marketing agreement, under which we receive fees for obtaining calling card applications from students. The Student Advantage Magazine, SAM, began publication in the fourth quarter of 1998. Other revenue and the cost of other revenue were each affected in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999 by the publication of two issues of SAM in each of those quartersPartly because of the seasonality factor noted above and partly because the next issue of SAM will not be published until the third quarter, other revenue in the second quarter of 1999 should be significantly less than it was in the third and fourth quarters of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999. OUR QUARTERLY REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST In addition to the seasonal fluctuations described above, our revenues and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter for a variety of other reasons, such as the timing of revenues from corporate sponsors or non-recurring charges incurred in connection with acquisitionsYou should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results or our operating results for any particular quarter as indicative of our future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this event, the price of our common stock might fall. OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON SELLING NEW MEMBERSHIPS EVERY YEAR A significant portion of our revenue is derived from membership fees. Members must join our program each year. A significant percentage of our members graduate each year and, therefore, do not renew their memberships. Our revenue growth is highly dependent upon our ability to market the value of our membership to college students and to retain members on a yearly basis. To date, we have not maintained sufficient data to determine the specific number of members who renew on a yearly basis. A failure to acquire new members or renew current members could have a material adverse effect on our business. 9 11 OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE BUSINESS ALLIANCES AND UNIVERSITY RELATIONSHIPS We are dependent upon our sponsors, both national and local, to provide our members with discounts on their products and services. We are also dependent on maintaining college and university relationships to market and sell our products and services. Our ability to maintain these alliances and relationships and to develop new alliances and relationships is critical to our ability to maintain our members. A failure to acquire or maintain sponsors and relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our agreements with a number of our sponsors preclude us from entering into similar arrangements with their competitors. This restriction may prevent us in some cases from offering attractive additional discounts to our members. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE INCREASINGLY RELUCTANT TO PERMIT BUSINESSES TO MARKET PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON CAMPUS Colleges and universities are becoming increasingly wary of businesses which market products and services to their students. Many colleges and universities are seeking to decrease or eliminate such marketing. In particular, colleges and universities are concerned that many students have incurred substantial levels of credit card debt. As a result, colleges and universities often attempt to prevent credit card companies and other companies that offer credit from marketing to their students. We are sometimes mistaken for a credit card company because we give students a plastic card and a unique identification number to represent their membership. This sometimes makes it difficult for us to gain access to college and university students, and we have been denied access to certain college and university campuses. To date, we have not maintained sufficient data to determine the specific number of colleges and universities which have denied us access to their campuses. Any inability to directly contact students on campus could have a material adverse effect on our business. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION ON THE INTERNET, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS Many Web sites compete for consumers' and advertisers' attention and spending. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors, including the following: - the market acceptance of our Web site and online services, - the success of our brand building and sales and marketing efforts, - the performance, price and reliability of services developed by us or our competitors, - the effectiveness of our customer service efforts, - the ability of our competitors to maintain or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with strategically aligned third parties, and - the emergence of new competitorsWe compete for members and advertisers online with the following types of companies: - online services or Web sites targeted at college students, and - Web search and retrieval and other online service companies, commonly referred to as portals, such as Alta Vista, Excite, Infoseek, Lycos and Yahoo! The number of Web sites competing for the attention and spending of advertisers and consumers, including college students, has increased and we expect it to continue to increase. This market is rapidly evolving and barriers to entry are low, enabling newcomers to launch competing sites at relatively low costIncreased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could adversely affect our business. Please see "Business -- Competition." OUR MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM EXPERIENCES SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM OTHER MARKETING ACTIVITIES We compete for client marketing budget dollars with other marketing activities and, in particular, other forms of direct marketing activities, such as direct mail. In recent years, there have been significant 10 12 advances in new forms of direct marketing, such as the development of interactive shopping and data collection through television, the Internet and other media. Many industry experts predict that electronic interactive commerce, such as shopping and information exchange via the Internet, will proliferate significantly in the foreseeable future. To the extent such proliferation occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on the demand for membership programs. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE ATTRACTIVE ACQUISITIONS OR INTEGRATE ACQUIRED COMPANIES As part of our business strategy, we plan to acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, products, services or technologies to increase our online traffic and obtain new technologies. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates. Even if we do identify suitable candidates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms. If we buy a business, we could have difficulty in assimilating that company's personnel, operations, products, services or technologies into our operations. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholdersWe recently entered into an agreement to acquire University Netcasting, Inc., a leading operator of official athletic Web sites for colleges, universities and college sports associations. Consummation of the acquisition is subject to various conditions, including approval of the acquisition by the stockholders of University Netcasting. We cannot be certain that the acquisition will be completed. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of University Netcasting's business is accomplished in an efficient, effective and timely manner. The difficulty associated with integrating University Netcasting's business may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will be achieved. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS We have experienced a period of significant growth. This growth has placed significant demands on our management and strains on our resources. Revenue increased from approximately $1.7 million in 1996 to $17.4 million in 1998. During that same time period we increased from fewer than 50 to more than 150 employeesOur ability to manage changes in our business will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our operating, financial and management information systems. We cannot assure you that our personnel, systems and controls will be adequate to support our growth, if any. If we are unable to manage change effectively, maintain the quality of our products and services and retain key personnel, our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected. OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS MAY BE INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT FUTURE OPERATIONS We do not expect our current financial and management information systems to be adequate to support our operations in the future. We expect to replace our current accounting system within the next year. If we incur delays or difficulties in implementing an appropriate accounting system, our business could be adversely affected. OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS NO EXPERIENCE IN RUNNING A PUBLIC COMPANY Our management team has not had any experience in a leadership role in a public company. We cannot assure you that the management team as currently configured will be able to successfully transition into the leadership role of a public company. The failure of the management team to adequately handle this challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business. 11 13 WE MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY-QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IN A COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKET We need to hire additional members of our management team and other key employees. Competition for such personnel is intense. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring highly skilled employees with the appropriate qualifications. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel, our business could be adversely affected. TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS, WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE FUTURE FUNDING OF THESE CAPITAL NEEDS IS UNCERTAIN We require substantial working capital to fund our business. While we believe that this offering will provide us with sufficient funding for the foreseeable future, if capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned, we may require additional financingAdditional funds raised through the issuance of equity securities may have the following negative effects on the then current common stockholders: - dilution in percentage of ownership in Student Advantage, and - the rights, preferences or privileges of the new security holders may be senior to those of the common stockholdersAdditional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all. Our failure to raise additional funds, if needed, may result in our inability to: - develop or enhance our services, - take advantage of future opportunities, or - respond to competitive pressures. OUR SYSTEMS MAY FAIL OR EXPERIENCE A SLOWDOWN Substantially all of our communications hardware and certain of our other computer hardware operations are located at USWeb Corporation's facilities in New York. Fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events could damage these systems. Computer viruses, electronic break-ins or other similar disruptive problems could also adversely affect our Web site. Our business could be adversely affected if our systems were affected by any of these occurrences. Our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems. We do not presently have any secondary "off-site" systems or a formal disaster recovery planOur Web site must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information. Our Web site has in the past and may in the future experience slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive our Web site as not functioning properly and therefore cause them to use another Web site or other methods to obtain informationIn addition, our users depend on Internet service providers, online service providers and other Web site operators for access to our Web site. Many of them have experienced significant outages in the past, and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THIRD PARTIES FOR SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS AND RELATED SERVICES We are dependent on various third parties for software, systems and related services. For example, a third party provides warehousing, distribution, fulfillment, mail and data processing services for us. As a result, our ability to deliver various services to our users may be adversely affected by the failure of these third parties to provide reliable software, systems and related services to us. 12 14 We have in the past and may in the future experience slower response times or delays in the processing of applications for students and the delivery of membership identification cards to our members. Many of these delays have been caused by third parties upon which we rely for fulfillment services. If we are unsuccessful in providing our members with membership identification cards or delivering products and services on a timely basis, our business may be adversely affected. WE MAY BE SUED FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVED FROM THE INTERNET Inappropriate use of our Internet services We may be subjected to claims for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, personal injury or other legal theories relating to the information we publish on our Web site or in our magazine. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services as well as other print publications in the past. We could also be subjected to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our Web site through links to other Web sites or through content and materials that may be posted by members in chat rooms or bulletin boards. We also offer e-mail services, which may subject us to potential risks, such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited e-mail, lost or misdirected messages, illegal or fraudulent use of e-mail or interruptions or delays in e-mail service. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of claimsMisappropriation of personal information Any penetration of our network security or other misappropriation of our members' personal or credit card information could subject us to liability. We may be liable for claims based on unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. Claims could also be based on other misuses of personal information, such as for unauthorized marketing purposes. These claims could result in litigation. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and several states have investigated the use by certain Internet companies of personal information. We could incur expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if our privacy practices were investigated. THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY OUR WEB SITE VISITORS MAY LIMIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS Web sites typically place certain "cookies" on a user's hard drive without the user's knowledge or consent. Cookies are small files of information about an Internet user's movement through the Internet that are stored on the hard drive of the user's computer. Student Advantage and other Web sites use cookies for a variety of reasons, including the collection of data derived from the user's Internet activity. Most currently available Web browsers allow users to remove cookies at any time or to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive. In addition, some commentators, privacy advocates and governmental bodies have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies. Any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. In addition, the European Union recently adopted a directive addressing data privacy that may limit the collection and use of certain information regarding Internet users. This directive may limit our ability to target advertising or collect and use information in certain European countries. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RESPOND TO THE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN OUR INDUSTRY Our market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. The recent growth of the Internet and intense competition in our industry exacerbates these market characteristics. To achieve our goals, we need to effectively integrate the various software programs and tools required to enhance and improve our product offerings and manage our business. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of our services. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of 13 15 new products and services. In addition, our new enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective members and must achieve significant market acceptance. We could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our service or infrastructures to adapt to these changes. OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE VIOLATED OR SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND WE MAY INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS We believe that protection of our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property is critical to our success. We rely on the following mechanisms to protect such intellectual property: - trademark and copyright law, - trade secret protection, and - confidentiality agreements with employees, customers, independent contractors, sponsors and othersDespite our best efforts, we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be infringed, violated or legally imitated. Failure to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business We have been, and expect to be, sued or named as a defendant in the future for infringement of the trademark and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Any such proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. THE FAILURE OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE PROGRAMS TO BE YEAR 2000 COMPLIANT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS Many currently installed computer systems and software products only accept two digits to identify the year in any date. Thus, the year 2000 will appear as "00", which the system might consider to be the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could result in system failures, delays or miscalculations causing disruptions to our operationsWe are currently conducting an inventory of, and developing testing procedures for, all software and other systems that we believe might be affected by Year 2000 issues. Since third parties developed and currently support many of the systems that we use, a significant part of this effort will be to ensure that these third-party systems are Year 2000 compliant. We plan to confirm this compliance through a combination of the representation by these third parties of their products' Year 2000 compliance, as well as specific testing of these systems. The failure of systems maintained by third parties to be Year 2000 compliant could cause us to incur significant expense to remedy any problems, reduce our revenues from such third parties or otherwise seriously damage our business. A significant Year 2000-related disruption of the network services or equipment that third-party vendors provide to us could also cause our members or other users to consider seeking alternate providers or cause an unmanageable burden on our customer service and technical supportOur failure to correct a material Year 2000 problem could result in an interruption in, or a failure of, some of our normal business activities or operations. WE WILL HAVE BROAD DISCRETION OVER USE OF PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING A significant portion of the anticipated net proceeds to Student Advantage from this offering have not been designated for specific uses. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion with respect to the use of these funds. 14 16 CERTAIN CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS OWN A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR VOTING STOCK Following the closing of this offering, based on the number of shares outstanding on April 30, 1999, our officers, directors and affiliated entities together will beneficially own approximately 79% of our outstanding common stock (77% if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). As a result, these stockholders will be able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval and, thereby, our management and affairs. Matters that typically require stockholder approval include: - election of directors, - merger or consolidation, and - sale of substantially all of our assetsThis concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would result in a change of control, which in turn could reduce the market price of our common stock. THE STOCK PRICE OF TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY INTERNET-RELATED COMPANIES, COULD BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND MAY RESULT IN LITIGATION AGAINST US We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in Student Advantage will lead to the development of a trading market or how liquid that market might become. The initial public offering price for the shares will be determined by negotiations between us and the underwriters' representatives and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market. The stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and the market prices of technology companies, particularly Internet-related companies, have been highly volatile. Investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the initial public offering priceIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. Litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR PUBLIC SALE AFTER THIS OFFERING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE After this offering, based on the number of shares outstanding on April 30, 1999, there will be outstanding 30,497,061 shares of our common stock (32,924,664 shares if the merger with University Netcasting is completed). There will be an additional 900,000 shares outstanding if the underwriters' over- allotment option is exercised in full. Of these shares, the shares sold in this offering will be freely tradeable except for any shares purchased by our "affiliates"</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS This offering involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information set forth in this Prospectus, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company and its business before purchasing any of the shares of Common Stock of the Company. This Prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of the Company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. When used in this Prospectus, the words "expects," "anticipates," "intends" and "plans" and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements. The cautionary statements made in this Prospectus should be read as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Prospectus. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this Prospectus. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this ProspectusLIMITED OPERATING HISTORY The Company was formed as a sole proprietorship in September 1995 and incorporated in May 1996. Thus, it has only a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects. The Company's prospects must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as online commerce. To address these risks and uncertainties, the Company must, among other things, maintain and increase the number of its registered users, items listed on its service, completed auctions, maintain and enhance its brand, implement and execute its business and marketing strategy successfully, continue to develop and upgrade its technology and information- processing systems, continue to enhance the eBay service to meet the needs of a changing market, provide superior customer service, respond to competitive developments and attract, integrate, retain and motivate qualified personnelThere can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing all of these things, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." NO ASSURANCE OF CONTINUED PROFITABILITYThe Company believes that its continued growth and profitability will depend in large part on its ability to (i) increase its brand name awareness, (ii) provide its customers with superior community and trading experiences and (iii) maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract buyers and sellers Accordingly, the Company intends to invest heavily in marketing and promotion, further development of the eBay auction Web site, technology and operating infrastructure development. Although the Company has experienced significant revenue growth and significant growth in the number of its registered users and items listed for auction in recent periods, such growth rates are not sustainable and will decrease in the future. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of the Company's business and its limited operating history, the Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe Company's operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during its short operating history and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside the Company's control. Factors that may affect the Company's quarterly operating results include: (i) the Company's ability to retain an active user base, attract new users who list items for sale and who 6 complete transactions through its service, and maintain customer satisfaction; (ii) the Company's ability to manage the number of items listed on its service; (iii) the announcement or introduction of new sites, services and products by the Company or its competitors; (iv) the success of the Company's brand building and marketing campaigns; (v) price competition; (vi) the level of use of the Internet and online services; (vii) increasing consumer confidence in and acceptance of the Internet and other online services for commerce and, in particular, the trading of products such as those listed on eBay; (viii) consumer confidence in the security of transactions over the Internet; (ix) the Company's ability to upgrade and develop its systems and infrastructure to accommodate growth; (x) the Company's ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner; (xi) the volume of items listed on the Company's Web site; (xii) the timing, cost and availability of advertising in traditional media and on other Web sites and online services; (xiii) technical difficulties or service interruptions; (xiv) the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of the Company's business, operations and infrastructure; (xv) consumer trends and popularity of certain categories of collectible items; (xvi) volume, size, timing and completion rate of trades on eBay; (xvii) governmental regulation by Federal or local governments; and (xviii) general economic conditions as well as economic conditions specific to the Internet and online commerce industries.As a result of the Company's limited operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which it competes, it is difficult for the Company to forecast its revenues or earnings accurately. In addition, the Company has no backlog and a significant portion of the Company's net revenues for a particular quarter are derived from auctions that are listed and completed during that quarter. The Company's current and future expense levels are based largely on its investment plans and estimates of future revenues and are, to a large extent, fixed. The Company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues relative to the Company's planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, the Company may from time to time make certain pricing, service or marketing decisions that could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.Due to the foregoing factors, the Company's quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast. The Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. In addition, it is likely that in one or more future quarters the Company's operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In such event, the trading price of the Common Stock would almost certainly be materially adversely affected. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe Company believes that its results of operations are somewhat seasonal in nature, with fewer auctions listed around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays in the fourth quarter. The Company's limited operating history, however, makes it difficult to fully assess the impact of these seasonal factors or whether or not its business is susceptible to cyclical fluctuations in the U.S. economy. In addition, the Company believes that its rapid growth may have overshadowed whatever seasonal or cyclical factors might have influenced its business to date. There can be no assurance that seasonal or cyclical variations in the Company's operations will not become more pronounced over time or that they will not materially adversely affect its results of operations in the future. Moreover, consumer "fads" and other changes in consumer trends may cause significant fluctuations in the Company's operating results from one quarter to the next. See "--Risks Related to Consumer Trends." 7 MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL GROWTHThe Company is currently experiencing a period of significant expansion and anticipates that further expansion will be required to address potential growth in its customer base and market opportunities. This expansion has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on the Company's management, operational and financial resources. From inception to June 30, 1998, the Company expanded from one to 76 employees. Certain members of the Company's management, including the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Marketing have joined the Company in 1998. The Company's new employees include a number of key managerial, marketing, planning, technical and operations personnel who have not yet been fully integrated into the Company, and the Company expects to add additional key personnel in the near future. To manage the expected growth of its operations and personnel, the Company will be required to improve existing and implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and to expand, train and manage its growing employee base. The Company also will be required to expand its finance, administrative and operations staff. Further, the Company may be required to enter into relationships with various strategic partners, Web sites and other online service providers and other third parties necessary to the Company's businessThere can be no assurance that the Company's current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support the Company's future operations, that management will be able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel or that Company management will be able to identify, manage and exploit existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities. The failure of the Company to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Business-- Employees." DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNELThe Company's performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of its senior management and other key personnel. The Company's performance also depends on the Company's ability to retain and motivate its other officers and key employees. The loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company does not have long-term employment agreements with any of its key personnel and maintains no "key person" life insurance policies. The Company's future success also depends on its ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully attract, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In particular, the Company has encountered difficulties in attracting a sufficient number of qualified software developers for its Web site and transaction processing systems, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain and attract such developers. The failure to retain and attract the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business--Employees" and "Management." DEPENDENCE ON CONTINUED GROWTH OF DEVELOPING ONLINE PERSON-TO-PERSON COMMERCE MARKETThe market for the sale of goods over the Internet, particularly through person-to-person trading, is a new and emerging market. The Company's future revenues and profits are substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of the Internet and other online services as a medium for commerce by consumers. Rapid growth in the use of and interest in the Web, the Internet and other online services is a recent phenomenon and there can be no assurance that this acceptance and use will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will adopt, and continue to use, the Internet as a medium of commerce. Demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the Internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty, and there exist few 8 proven services and products. Growth in the Company's user base relies on obtaining consumers who have historically used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods. For the Company to be successful, these consumers must accept and use novel ways of conducting business and exchanging information.In addition, the Internet may not be commercially viable in the long term for a number of reasons, including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies, performance improvements and security measures. To the extent that the Internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users, their frequency of use or their bandwidth requirements, there can be no assurance that the infrastructure for the Internet and other online services will be able to support the demands placed upon them. In addition, the Internet or other online services could lose their viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet or other online service activity, or due to increased governmental regulation. Changes in or insufficient availability of telecommunications services to support the Internet or other online services also could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the Internet and other online services generally and the eBay service in particular. If use of the Internet and other online services does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected, if the infrastructure for the Internet and other online services does not effectively support growth that may occur, or if the Internet and other online services do not become a viable commercial marketplace, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affectedRISK OF CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS The Company seeks to generate a high volume of traffic and transactions on the eBay service. Accordingly, the satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of the Company's Web site, processing systems and network infrastructure are critical to the Company's reputation and its ability to attract and retain large numbers of users who bid for or sell items on its service while maintaining adequate customer service levels. The Company's revenues depend on the number of items listed by users, the volume of user auctions that are successfully completed and the final prices paid for the items listed. Any system interruptions that result in the unavailability of the Company's service or reduced customer activity would reduce the volume of items listed and auctions completed and could affect the average selling price of the items. Interruptions of service may also diminish the attractiveness of the Company and its services. The Company has experienced periodic system interruptions, which it believes will continue to occur from time to time. Any substantial increase in the volume of traffic on the Company's Web site or in the number of auctions being conducted by customers will require the Company to expand and upgrade its technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases, if any, in the use of the eBay service or timely expand and upgrade its systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases in a timely manner. Any failure to expand or upgrade its systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company uses internally developed systems to operate its service and for transaction processing, including billing and collections processing. The Company must continually enhance and improve these systems in order to accommodate the level of use of eBay. Furthermore, in the future, the Company may add additional features and functionality to its services that would result in the need to develop or license additional technologies. The Company's inability to add additional software and hardware or to develop and further upgrade its existing technology, transaction processing systems or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic on the eBay service or increased transaction volume through its processing systems or to provide new features or functionality may cause unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of customer service, impaired quality of the user's experience on the eBay service, and delays in reporting accurate 9 financial information. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able in a timely manner to effectively upgrade and expand its systems or to integrate smoothly any newly developed or purchased technologies with its existing systems. Any inability to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "--Risk of System Failures" and "Business--Operations and Technology." RISK OF SYSTEM FAILURESThe Company's success, and in particular its ability to facilitate trades successfully and provide high quality customer service, depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware systems. Substantially all of the Company's computer hardware for operating the eBay service is currently located at the facilities of Exodus Communications, Inc. ("Exodus") in Santa Clara, California. These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. The Company does not presently have fully redundant systems, a formal disaster recovery plan or alternative providers of hosting services and does not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate it for losses that may occurDespite any precautions taken by, and planned to be taken by the Company, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at the Exodus facility could result in interruptions in the services provided by the Company. In addition, the failure by Exodus to provide the data communications capacity required by the Company, as a result of human error, natural disaster or other operational disruption, could result in interruptions in the Company's service. Any damage to or failure of the systems of the Company could result in reductions in, or terminations of, the eBay service, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.In the case of frequent or persistent system failures, the Company's reputation and name brand could be materially adversely affected. Although the Company has implemented certain network security measures, its servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of data or the inability to complete customer auctions. In addition, although the Company works to prevent unauthorized access to Company data, it is impossible to eliminate this risk completely. The occurrence of any and all of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business--Operations and Technology" and "--Facilities." INTENSE COMPETITIONThe market for person-to-person trading over the Internet is new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and the Company expects competition to intensify further in the future. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and current and new competitors can launch new sites at a relatively low cost using commercially-available software. The Company currently or potentially competes with a number of other companies. The Company's direct competitors include various online person-to-person auction services, including Yahoo! Auctions Powered by Onsale; Auction Universe, a Times-Mirror Company; Excite, Inc. ("Excite"); and a number of other small services, including those that serve specialty markets. The Company also competes indirectly with business- to-consumer online auction services such as Onsale, First Auction, ZAuction and Surplus Auction. The Company potentially faces competition from a number of large online communities and services that have expertise in developing online commerce and in facilitating online person-to-person interactionCertain of these potential competitors, including Amazon.com, America Online, Inc. ("AOL") and Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), currently offer a variety of business-to-consumer trading services and classified ad services and certain of these companies may introduce person-to-person trading to their large user populations. Other large companies with strong brand recognition and experience in online commerce, such as Cendant Corporation, QVC and large newspaper or media companies may also seek to 10 compete in the online auction market. Competitive pressures created by any one of these companies, or by the Company's competitors collectively, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are volume and selection of goods, population of buyers and sellers, community cohesion and interaction, customer service, reliability of delivery and payment by users, brand recognition, Web site convenience and accessibility, price, quality of search tools and system reliability. Certain of the Company's current and many of the Company's potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and Internet markets and significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources than the Company. In addition, other online trading services may be acquired by, receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established and well- financed companies as use of the Internet and other online services increasesTherefore, certain of the Company's competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to Web site and systems development than the Company or may try to attract traffic by offering services for free. Increased competition may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value in the Company's brand. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, the Company may, from time to time, make certain pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. New technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase the competitive pressures on the Company by enabling the Company's competitors to offer a lower-cost service. Certain Web-based applications that direct Internet traffic to certain Web sites may channel users to trading services that compete with the Company. Although the Company has established Internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies, there can be no assurance that these arrangements will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or that they will otherwise continue to result in increased usage of the eBay service. In addition, companies that control access to transactions through network access or Web browsers could promote the Company's competitors or charge the Company substantial fees for inclusionAny and all of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business--Competition." RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BRAND DEVELOPMENT The Company believes that its historical growth has been largely attributable to word-of-mouth. Despite this historical organic growth, the Company believes that continuing to strengthen its brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of eBay, particularly in light of the competitive nature of the Company's market. Promoting and positioning its brand will depend largely on the success of the Company's marketing efforts and the ability of the Company to provide high quality services. In order to promote its brand, the Company will need to increase its marketing budget and otherwise increase its financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand loyalty among users. There can be no assurance that brand promotion activities will yield increased revenues or that any such revenues would offset the expenses incurred by the Company in building its brand. Further, there can be no assurance that any new users attracted to eBay will conduct transactions over eBay on a regular basis. If the Company fails to promote and maintain its brand or incurs substantial expenses in an attempt to promote and maintain its brand or if the Company's existing or future strategic relationships fail to promote the Company's brand or increase brand awareness, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. See "Business--eBay Strategy." 11 RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGEThe market in which the Company competes is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new service and product announcements, introductions and enhancements and changing customer demands. These market characteristics are exacerbated by the emerging nature of the Web and the apparent need of companies from a multitude of industries to offer Web-based products and services. Accordingly, the Company's future success will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt its services to evolving industry standards and to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of its service in response to competitive service and product offerings and evolving demands of the marketplace. The failure of the Company to adapt to such changes would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require substantial expenditures by the Company to modify or adapt its services or infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business--Operations and Technology." RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW SERVICES, FEATURES AND FUNCTIONSThe Company plans to expand its operations by developing and promoting new or complementary services, products or transaction formats or expanding the breadth and depth of services. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to expand its operations in a cost-effective or timely manner or that any such efforts would maintain or increase overall market acceptanceFurthermore, any new business or service launched by the Company that is not favorably received by consumers could damage the Company's reputation and diminish the value of its brand name. Expansion of the Company's operations in this manner would also require significant additional expenses and development, operations and other resources and would strain the Company's management, financial and operational resources. The lack of market acceptance of such services or the Company's inability to generate satisfactory revenues from such expanded services to offset their cost could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial conditionRISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER TRENDS The Company derives substantially all of its revenues from fees from sellers for listing products for sale on its service and fees from successfully completed auctions. The Company's future revenues will depend upon continued demand for the types of goods that are listed by users of the eBay serviceThe popularity of certain categories of items, such as toys, dolls and memorabilia, among consumers may vary over time due to perceived scarcity, subjective value, and societal and consumer trends in general. For example during the three months ended June 30, 1998, the Company had, at times, over 30,000 simultaneous auctions listed in its "Beanie Babies" category. A decline in the popularity of, or demand for, certain collectibles or other items sold through the eBay service could reduce the overall volume of transactions on the eBay service, resulting in reduced revenues. In addition, certain consumer "fads" may temporarily inflate the volume of certain types of items listed on the eBay service, placing a significant strain upon the Company's infrastructure and transaction capacity. These trends may also cause significant fluctuations in the Company's operating results from one quarter to the next. Any decline in demand for the goods offered through the eBay service as a result of changes in consumer trends could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial conditionRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN ACTIVITIES ON THE COMPANY'S SERVICE The law relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users on the service is currently unsettled. While the Company does not pre-screen the types of goods offered on eBay, the Company is aware that certain goods, such as alcohol, tobacco, firearms, adult material 12 other goods that may be subject to regulation by local, state or federal authorities have been traded on the eBay service. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to prevent the unlawful exchange of goods on its service or that it will successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through the Company's service. The imposition upon the Company of potential liability for unlawful activities of users of the eBay service could require the Company to implement measures to reduce its exposure to such liability, which may require, among other things, the Company to spend substantial resources and/or or to discontinue certain service offerings. Any costs incurred as a result of such liability or asserted liability could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business-- Government Regulation."In addition, the Company's success depends largely upon sellers reliably delivering and accurately representing the listed goods and buyers paying the agreed purchase price. The Company takes no responsibility for delivery of payment or goods to any user of the eBay service. The Company has received in the past, and anticipates that it will receive in the future, communications from users who did not receive the purchase price or the goods that were to have been exchanged. While the Company can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations to other users, the Company, beyond crediting sellers with the amount of their fees in certain circumstances, does not have the ability to otherwise require users to make payments or deliver goods and the Company does not compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other users. The Company also from time to time receives complaints from buyers</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS These securities involve a high degree of risk. This Prospectus contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed in this Prospectus, including the risk factors set forth below. Prospective purchasers of the Common Stock should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information set forth in this Prospectus, prior to investing in the Common Stock offered hereby. UNPREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS; LIKELY FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result, the Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful, and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's revenues will grow or be sustained in future periods or that the Company will maintain its current profitability in the future. A significant component of such quarterly fluctuations results from the demand by the Company's customers for Gamma sterilization services. Other factors that could cause the Company's revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period include volatility in the market for medical devices; the ability of the Company to deliver sterilization services in a timely and cost effective manner; the ability of the Company to expand successfully in the non-medical sterilization services market; the timing and size of orders from the Company's customer base; the ability of the Company to obtain supplies of Cobalt 60 on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost; fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar; the costs associated with customer product being damaged as a consequence of overdosing and other factors; changes in interest rates; regulatory matters; seasonality associated with historical decreases in medical procedures during the fourth calendar quarter; and litigation, acquisitions and other extraordinary events. The Company's results of operations are also influenced by competitive factors, including the pricing and availability of the Company's and competing sterilization services; the acceptance of Gamma sterilization as a means of sterilizing products as opposed to other methods of sterilization; the ability of the Company's competitors to obtain orders from the Company's customers; the establishment of in-house sterilization capabilities by the Company's customers; the acquisition of the Company's customers by entities that do not use the Company's sterilization services; the timing of new service or technology announcements and releases by the Company and its competitors; and the entry of new competitors into the market for sterilization and radiation processing services. A large portion of the Company's expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time. If revenues do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company's fixed expenses would exacerbate the effect of such a shortfall on net income Additional factors that have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations are the timing of construction and commencement of operations of new facilities. Building new facilities requires significant capital investments in construction, equipment and Cobalt 60. In addition to incurring costs associated with building and equipping such facilities, the Company also incurs costs related to Cobalt 60 and higher personnel costs in the months preceding initial operation. In the past, as a result of their own internal procedures, customers have delayed qualification and use of new facilities until they had been operational for a specified period of time of up to 12 months. As a result, the Company failed to realize a portion of anticipated revenues for the facility pending such qualification, while incurring significant start-up costs, both of which adversely affected the Company's results of operations. See " -- Substantial Debt." Due to these factors, as well as other unanticipated factors, it is likely that in some future quarter the Company's operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. In such event, the price of the Company's Common Stock would be materially adversely affected. See "-- No Prior Trading Market; Potential Volatility of Stock Price," "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 6 7 DEPENDENCE ON MEDICAL PRODUCTS CUSTOMERS The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of sterilization services to manufacturers of medical devices, labware and eyecare products ("medical products"), and the Company expects that the sterilization of medical products will continue to account for a significant portion of the Company's revenues for the foreseeable future. The future success of the Company thus depends to a considerable extent upon the continued growth of the market for medical products. In particular, a significant aspect of the Company's medical products business is the sterilization of single-use medical devices. As a result, the future success of the Company depends in part on continued growth in the market for single-use medical devices. There has recently been an increasing focus on reusable medical devices and, therefore, there can be no assurance that use of reusable medical devices in lieu of single-use devices will not increase. The Company believes that continued growth in the use of medical products depends on a number of factors, including the impact of health reform proposals. The Company believes that government and private insurance company efforts to contain or reduce health care costs are likely to continue. These trends may lead to fewer medical procedures being performed or the increased use of reusable medical devices, either of which could negatively impact the demand for the Company's services. Loss of significant business from medical products manufacturers, including reductions caused by large customers establishing captive facilities, changes in such customers' competitive position, a decision to purchase contract sterilization services from other suppliers or a downturn in the medical products market, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Business -- Industry Background." COMPETITION The market for sterilization services is intensely competitive and is characterized by significant price competition. The Company competes with other companies that provide Gamma sterilization services, the most significant of which is Isomedix, Inc. ("Isomedix"). In addition, many products that can be sterilized using Gamma can also be sterilized using either EtO or electron beam ("E-Beam") sterilization. As a result, the Company also competes with companies that process products using EtO or E-Beam technology. Companies processing products using EtO include Cosmed Group, Inc., Griffith Micro Science, Inc. and Isomedix. Certain of the Company's competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, distribution, technical and other resources than the Company or offer multiple sterilization technologies, which may enable them to address a broader range of the sterilization requirements of individual customers. In addition, the Company competes with manufacturers that have or are considering establishing in-house sterilization capabilities. The Company may also in the future face competition from suppliers of Cobalt 60 radioisotope, particularly MDS Nordion, Inc. ("Nordion"), as well as foreign providers of sterilization services. In addition, Isomedix has announced its intention to enter the California market for sterilization services, which would increase competition in that market. To the extent that the Company expands into international markets it will also be faced with competition from existing providers of sterilization in those marketsIn recent years, price competition in the sterilization services industry has intensified. The Company may in the future face increased competition from companies that employ new or improved technologies or that offer sterilization services that are more effective or less costly than those developed and marketed by the Company. Such competition could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to compete effectively or that the competitive pressures faced by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Business -- Competition." UNCERTAINTY OF EXPANSION IN NON-MEDICAL MARKETS While the Company has traditionally focused primarily on the medical products market, it has recently increased its efforts in the non-medical contract sterilization services market. The Company currently sterilizes a wide range of food ingredients and consumer products, including cosmetics, spices and herbs. In 7 8 addition, the Company processes various industrial compounds. These services accounted for 20% of the Company's revenues in fiscal 1997. Many of the non-medical markets for Gamma sterilization and processing are new and emerging, and there can be no assurance that any of these markets will develop at the anticipated rate, if at all. See "Business -- Markets and Customers." Approval for the irradiation of food products is regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and the United States Department of Agriculture (the "USDA"). The FDA has approved radiation for the processing of a variety of foods, including pork, poultry and fresh fruits and vegetables. However, only limited commercial sales of irradiated food have taken place. The FDA is currently considering a petition to approve the irradiation of fresh packaged red meats in order to eliminate E. coli and other harmful pathogens. Any irradiation processing of meat or poultry is also regulated by the USDA, which requires preapproval of the irradiation process. Although the Company may in the future seek to take advantage of opportunities to sterilize meat and poultry products, the sterilization of fresh food products such as meat and poultry would require significant changes in the Company's processing techniques, including the redesign of facilities and the addition of refrigeration capabilities. In addition, current FDA rules and regulations require the labeling of any retail food product that is irradiated, and to date there has been significant consumer resistance to irradiated food. As a result, there can be no assurance that Gamma sterilization of food products will gain public acceptance or will ultimately prove commercially feasible in the U.S. or that the Company would undertake to expand its irradiation activities to include meat and poultry. RISKS RELATED TO GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION USING THE MINICELL; RISKS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS A key element of the Company's strategy is to expand geographically into smaller regional markets and internationally using the MiniCell. There can be no assurance that manufacturers in these markets will use the Company's facilities, that such manufacturers will pay higher sterilization prices in exchange for lower transportation costs and a decrease in turn-around time or that the Company will receive enough volume of product to operate such facilities on a profitable basis. In addition, many manufacturers in these smaller markets currently use EtO to sterilize their products and would need to convert their products to Gamma. Failure of the Company to successfully introduce and operate MiniCells in these new markets could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operationsIf the Company is successful in expanding into international markets, it will be subject to a number of risks related to foreign operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political and economic conditions in various jurisdictions, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences. There can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's future operations outside the U.S. In addition, in the past the Company has been unsuccessful in its attempts to penetrate international markets and in fiscal 1995 wrote-off a total of $3.0 million invested in joint ventures in Taiwan and Indonesia. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO MINICELL LEASING The Company's ability to successfully lease its MiniCell will depend upon the acceptance of the Company's technology and the concept of "in-house outsourcing" (utilizing third party contractors to provide services within a manufacturer's own facility) by manufacturers with high volume sterilization needs, as well as upon the Company's ability to enter into favorable leasing terms with potential customers. The Company has not yet leased a MiniCell, and there can be no assurance that manufacturers will elect to lease a MiniCell in lieu of relying on traditional in-house sterilization operations and contract sterilization providers or that any such leases will be on terms favorable to the Company. In addition, the leasing of the MiniCell will involve a significant commitment of management attention and resources by prospective customers and may require input from and approval at multiple levels of a customer's organization. Accordingly, the Company anticipates that the MiniCell leasing process will be subject to long sales cycles typically associated with significant capital expenditures. Delay in or the failure to lease the MiniCell could have a material adverse effect on the 8 9 Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Business -- The SteriGenics Approach." DEPENDENCE ON A SINGLE TECHNOLOGY The Company performs all of its sterilization services using Gamma radiation. Because of its use of a single technology, a decline in the demand for, or the pricing of, Gamma sterilization services would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. To remain competitive, the Company may also need to respond quickly to technological changes and innovations in the sterilization services market, including changes in the technologies used to perform sterilization services that could render Gamma sterilization obsolete or noncompetitive. The Company is also dependent upon continued consumer acceptance of the Gamma sterilization of medical products. Failure by the Company to quickly and effectively respond to changes in the sterilization market, including the development of new technologies, or a significant increase in consumer resistance to products sterilized by Gamma, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "-- Competition." GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND STANDARDS COMPLIANCE The Company's business is subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, agency actions and court decisions. Although the Company believes it has received all licenses and permits necessary to conduct its current sterilization business, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be found in violation of applicable requirements or that governmental bodies will not seek to impose regulatory requirements not now anticipated on the Company and its business. In addition, the long-term course of regulatory policy cannot be predicted and, although the Company believes that all necessary regulatory approvals have been obtained, there can be no assurance that laws and regulations will not be applied in a manner that adversely affects the Company. The imposition of such regulatory requirements could force the Company to alter or cease operations of its facilities and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operationsThe design, construction, use and operation of commercial irradiation facilities such as those operated by the Company, and byproduct materials used in such facilities, are extensively regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the "NRC"), or in some cases by various state regulatory agencies and authorities that undertake comparable regulatory functions from the NRC (the "Agreement States"). In addition, the Company is subject to various local zoning and permit rules in the construction of its facilities. The Company's facilities are subject to regulation by additional regulatory bodies at the federal, state and local levels, depending upon the type of product that is being irradiated. The Company's facilities are subject to the requirements of the FDA when irradiating medical devices, foods, cosmetics or food or drug packaging materials. In addition, if the Company were to begin processing meat or poultry products, it would become subject to the requirements of the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA, which would require preapproval of the irradiation process for meat and poultry. The Company is also subject to the requirements of other federal agencies, such as the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"). In addition, the Company is subject to the regulatory requirements of the state and local agencies in the jurisdictions where the various irradiation facilities are locatedIn addition to extensive regulation by various governmental bodies and agencies, the Company is subject to standards, guidelines and requirements established by industry organizations and other non-governmental bodies, such as the International Standards Organization ("ISO") and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ("AAMI") Changes in, or reinterpretations of, existing requirements and standards or adoption of new requirements beyond those described below or the failure at any time to comply with any applicable material regulations and standards could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will not incur significant costs to comply with laws, 9 10 regulations and other requirements in the future or that such laws, regulations and other requirements will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.NRC Regulation of Irradiation Facilities The receipt, acquisition, ownership, transfer, possession, use, transportation and disposal of nuclear byproduct material, as well as the construction, operation, transfer, closure and decommissioning of commercial irradiation facilities such as those operated by the Company, are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by the NRC or, in some cases, by the Agreement StatesAlthough there can be no assurance, the Company believes it has received all licenses and permits necessary for the conduct of its business. Commercial Gamma sterilization facilities, such as those owned or operated by the Company are subject to both regularly scheduled and unannounced inspections by the NRC or the Agreement States, with regard to all aspects of their operation, recordkeeping, compliance with health and safety regulations and all aspects of the utilization, storage, transfer, possession and transportation of regulated byproduct materials. Noncompliance with the health and safety regulations of the NRC and most Agreement States are generally ranked according to levels of severity. Since 1993, the Company has received notices of violation from the NRC and the Agreement States concerning items of noncompliance at four of its facilities, which were not in such categories as to be of "significant regulatory concern." The Company believes that it has taken appropriate corrective actions in response to each such notice. In August 1996, the Company acquired certain assets of RTI, Inc. ("RTI"). The regulatory history of the former RTI facilities, as operated by RTI, involved, among other things, very significant regulatory compliance problems, which involved the payment of civil and criminal penalties by RTI, as well as a facility license suspension for a period of approximately 80 days. As a consequence of this regulatory history, there can be no assurance that the former RTI facilities will not be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and inspections for an extended period of time. Such heightened regulatory scrutiny and a failure by the Company to address concerns raised from such scrutiny and inspection could result in civil penalties or the suspension or termination of operations at one or more of the Company's facilities or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company has no knowledge of any circumstances that would constitute a present significant violation of applicable state or federal laws or regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not in the future be determined to be in violation of any such laws or regulationsThe terms and conditions of the Company's licenses may be revoked, amended, revised or modified by reason of changes in the applicable laws, rules, regulations, or agency orders. Any such action may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations Violations of or noncompliance with applicable governmental requirements may result in an enforcement action including, among other things, a notice of violation, imposition of civil penalties, suspension, modification or revocation of any applicable license, criminal prosecution, or withholding or recall of the nuclear byproduct material held by the Company. Any such action would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.FDA Regulation of Irradiation Facilities The Company's facilities are subject to the requirements of the FDA when irradiating medical devices, foods, cosmetics and food or drug packaging materials. Failure by the Company at any time to comply with applicable FDA requirements could lead the FDA to institute materially adverse enforcement actions against the Company and/or its customers, including, among other things, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, total or partial suspension of sterilization operations and criminal prosecution. Such enforcement actions would also harm the Company's business reputation and could cause the Company to lose customers to competitorsMedical devices, foods, cosmetics and food or drug packaging materials must be manufactured and processed in accordance with the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP"). No assurance can be 10 11 given that the FDA would find that the Company is in compliance with applicable GMP requirements or that the Company will be found in compliance at all times in the futureIrradiation is regulated by the FDA and is considered to be a food additive. Irradiation may only be used on foods and food packaging materials in accordance with the requirements established in the food additive regulations. The existing food additive regulations only approve the use of irradiation for a limited variety of foods and food packaging materials that are used during the irradiation of foods. Food packaging materials that are irradiated prior to filling are exempt from the premarket approval requirements, provided that the irradiated food packaging material is still suitable for use and complies with the applicable indirect food additive regulations. Before the Company could expand its sterilization services to certain foods or food packaging materials, the food additive regulations would have to be amended to include the irradiation of foods or food packaging materials not covered by the existing regulations. There can be no assurance that the FDA would amend the food additive regulations or that such regulations would be amended in a timely manner.Standards Compliance In addition to governmental regulation, the Company is required to comply with various standards in order to continue to provide sterilization services to medical products manufacturers. These standards include ISO 9002 and the standards for sterilization set by AAMI. The Company may in the future be required to comply with new and changing standards. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to comply with any new standards or that the cost of such compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Business -- Quality Assurance and Safety." RISKS OF OPERATING FACILITIES USING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL The operation of the Company's commercial irradiation facilities involves special risks, potential liabilities, and specific regulatory, radiological health and safety and environmental requirements and may raise concerns with respect to both worker safety and community reaction. Should an incident involving unplanned exposure beyond regulatory limits to radioactive materials occur at any of the Company's facilities, the resultant liability could be substantial. Such an incident would also result in adverse community reaction, which could impact the Company's ability to continue to operate any facility involved in such an incident, as well as similar facilities. In the event any losses or liabilities related to such an incident are underinsured or exceed accumulated funds, or adequate recovery is not possible, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affectedAlthough the Company believes it has implemented extensive safety procedures, there is potential risk that workers in the Company's facilities may be exposed to radiation beyond regulatory limits. In addition, the Company may encounter resistance from those in the communities where it seeks to build additional facilities or be subject to protests or other actions in areas where it has facilities based on perceived risk of exposure to radiation on the part of those living in the communities surrounding the Company's facilities. Any actual or perceived exposure to radiation as a result of the Company's activities or a failure related to the Company's safety procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operationsThe Company is not aware of any incidences of worker exposure to radiation beyond regulatory limits and has not experienced any contamination related to its use of Cobalt 60. However, in the spring of 1985, due to a temporary shortage in Cobalt 60 supply and in response to a program by the United States Department of Energy (the "DOE"), the Company leased over 400 stainless steel capsules of radioactive Cesium 137 ("Cesium") from the DOE for use at the Company's Decatur, Georgia and Westerville, Ohio irradiation facilities. On June 6, 1988, the Company discovered that one or more of the DOE's Cesium capsules had leaked radioactive Cesium, which is water soluble, into the water shielding pool, contaminating the Company's Decatur, Georgia facility. The Company no longer uses Cesium capsules in any of its facilities, and such capsules have generally been withdrawn from commercial use nationwide by the DOE. The Company is not aware of any ongoing environmental or other legal liabilities related to the Cesium incident. However, there 11 12 can be no assurance that unspecified third parties, including former employees, would not in the future, assert claims against the Company in connection with the contamination of the Decatur facility. See "-- Environmental Risks." The Cobalt 60 stored in water shielding pools at each of the Company's facilities is double encapsulated in stainless steel. Although the water in these pools is continuously monitored for any potential leakage and is deionized to protect against corrosion, there can be no assurance that the stainless steel capsules will not corrode. In 1995, the Company encountered minor corrosion in the outer encapsulation of certain of its Cobalt 60 rods, requiring their replacement. Since the quantity of Cobalt 60 in a facility is the key determinant of the amount of product that can be processed, any significant delay in the replacement of such Cobalt 60 could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the Company is determined to be responsible for the corrosion, it could be required to bear the costs of transportation and reencapsulation of the Cobalt 60. Furthermore, such corrosion, if undetected, could result in radioactive material being released into the water shielding pool, which could cause contamination of the pool and potentially the related facility. Any contamination resulting from such release and the related decontamination process would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "-- Government Regulation and Standards Compliance," "Business -- Facilities," "Business -- Quality Assurance and Safety" and "Business -- Regulatory and Environmental Matters." ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS The Company's operations are subject to regulation by the EPA as well as state and local governmental agencies. Although there can be no assurance, the Company believes it currently maintains all licenses and permits necessary to conduct its current business and that it is in material compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. The loss of any of the Company's licenses or permits could force the Company to suspend or terminate operations at one or more of its facilities or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operationsPursuant to an Asset Acquisition Agreement effective August 8, 1996 (the "Asset Agreement"), the Company purchased certain assets of RTI, including property located in Haw River, North Carolina and leasehold interests in property located in Salem, New Jersey and Rockaway, New Jersey (the "Rockaway Property"). The Rockaway Property was previously owned and operated by Thiokol Chemical Corporation ("Thiokol"), and is listed on the Superfund National Priorities List ("NPL"). In 1992, RTI and Thiokol entered into an Administrative Consent Order ("ACO") with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (the "NJDEP") requiring, among other things, implementation of a groundwater remedy estimated to exceed $2.0 million in costsUnder the Asset Agreement, RTI retained ownership of the Rockaway Property and all associated environmental liabilities as of the closing date. RTI agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against any and all claims which may arise directly or indirectly from any use or release of hazardous substances on or under the leased premises as of the closing date. In addition, the Company obtained a letter from the NJDEP stating that the NJDEP will not institute either judicial or administrative civil proceedings against the Company for any discharge, deposit, release or disposal of hazardous substances or pollutants existing at the Rockaway Property, emanating therefrom, or occurring before the closing. However, the Company is required by the NJDEP to maintain a standby letter of credit in the amount of $500,000, contingent upon the continued clean up efforts required of RTI. The required amount of the letter of credit decreases over the life of the leasehold interest, and/or as the NJDEP requires. Although there can be no assurance, the Company believes</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors this offering and an investment in our ordinary shares involve a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the risks described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this prospectus, before you decide to buy our ordinary shares. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. in this case, the trading price of our ordinary shares would likely decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. risks relating to our businesswe have a history of losses, may incur future losses and may not achieve profitability. we have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since we commenced operations in 1997. we incurred net losses of $2.4million in 2005, $3.3million in 2004 and $2.3million in 2003. as of september30, 2006, our accumulated deficit was $37.3million. our losses could continue for the next several years as we expand our sales and marketing activities and continue to invest in research and development. we may incur losses in the future and may not generate sufficient revenues in the future to achieve profitability.we are dependent on our netenforcer traffic management system and netxplorer network management application suite for all of our revenue. our revenues are currently derived solely from sales of our netenforcer traffic management system and netxplorer network management application suite, and from maintenance and support contracts related to these products. we currently expect that our revenues from these products will continue to account for all or substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future. as a result, any factor adversely affecting our ability to sell, or the pricing of or demand for, these products would severely harm our ability to generate revenues.we may be unable to compete effectively with other companies in our market who offer, or may in the future offer, competing technologies. we compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive sector of the networking technology market. our principal competitors are cisco systems, inc. (through its acquisition of p-cube, inc.), sandvine inc. and ellacoya networks, inc. in the service provider market, and packeteer inc. in the enterprise market. we also compete in particular geographic areas with a number of smaller local competitors and we compete indirectly with router and switch infrastructure companies with features that address some of the problems that our products address. we also face competition from companies that offer partial solutions addressing only one aspect of the challenges facing broadband providers, such as network monitoring or security. our competitors may announce new products, services or enhancements that better meet the needs of customers or changing industry requirements, or may offer alternative methods to achieve customer objectives. one of our direct competitors, cisco systems, is substantially larger than we are and has significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, technical, manufacturing and other resources. the entry of new competitors into our market and acquisitions of our existing competitors by companies with significant resources and established relationships with our potential customers could result in increased competition and harm our business. increased competition may cause price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations.demand for our products depends in part on the rate of adoption of bandwidth-intensive broadband applications, such as peer-to-peer (p2p), and latency-sensitive applications, such as voice-over-internet protocol (voip), internet video and online video gaming applications. our products are used by service providers and enterprises to monitor and manage bandwidth-intensive applications that cause congestion in broadband networks and impact the quality of experience of users. in addition to the general increase in applications delivered over broadband networks that require large amounts 8 of bandwidth, such as p2p applications, demand for our products is driven particularly by the growth in applications which are highly sensitive to network delays and therefore require efficient network management. these applications include voip, internet video and online video gaming applications. if the rapid growth in adoption of voip and in the popularity of internet video and online video gaming applications does not continue, the demand for our products may not grow as anticipated.we depend on third parties to market, sell, install, and provide initial technical support for our products. we market and sell our products to end-customers through third party channel partners, such as distributors, resellers, oems and system integrators. our channel partners are also responsible for installing our products and providing initial customer support for them. as a result, we depend on the ability of our channel partners to market and sell our products successfully to end-customers. if any significant channel partners fail, individually or in the aggregate, to perform as we expect, our sales may suffer. we also depend on our ability to maintain our relationships with existing channel partners and develop relationships in key markets with new channel partners. we cannot assure you that our channel partners will market our products effectively, receive and fulfill customer orders of our products on a timely basis or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing and technical support. our products are complex and it takes time for a new channel partner to gain experience in their operation and installation. therefore, it may take a period of time before a new channel partner can successfully market, sell and support our products if an existing channel partner ceases to sell our products. our channel partners install our products and provide initial customer support to end-customers of our products. any failure by our channel partners to provide adequate support to end-customers could result in customer dissatisfaction with us or our products, which could result in a loss of customers, harm our reputation and delay or limit market acceptance of our products. our agreements with channel partners are generally not exclusive and our channel partners may market and sell products that compete with our products. our agreements with our distributors and resellers are usually for an initial one year term and following the expiration of this term, they can be terminated by either party. we can give no assurance that these agreements will not be terminated upon proper notice and any such termination may adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.the market for our products in the service provider market is still emerging and our growth may be harmed if carriers do not adopt dpi solutions. the market for dpi technology is still emerging and the majority of our sales to date have been to small and midsize service providers and enterprises. we believe that the largest service providers, referred to as tier1 carriers, as well as cable and mobile operators, present a significant market opportunity and are an important element of our long term strategy, but they are still in the early stages of evaluating the benefits and applications of dpi technology. carriers may decide that full visibility into their networks or highly granular control over content based applications is not critical to their business. they may also determine that certain applications, such as voip or video, can be adequately prioritized in their networks by using router and switch infrastructure products without the use of dpi technology. they may also, in some instances, face regulatory constraints that could change the characteristics of the markets. furthermore, widespread adoption of our products by carriers will require that they migrate to a new business model based on offering subscriber and application-based tiered services and market these new services successfully to consumers. if carriers decide not to adopt dpi technology, our market opportunity would be reduced and our growth rate may be harmed.demand for our products may be impacted by government regulation of the telecommunications industry. carriers are subject to government regulation in jurisdictions in which we sell our products. for example, there has been a series of draft bills introduced to the u.s.congress in the first half of 2006 that would prohibit service providers from prioritizing applications from content providers who are prepared to pay for such service. to date, none of these bills has been adopted; however, some of these bills may still be raised for consideration and other jurisdictions in which we operate may adopt similar legislation. advocates for the 9 legislation claim that collecting premium fees from certain preferred customers would distort the market for internet applications in favor of larger and better-funded content providers and would impact end users who purchased broadband access only to experience differing response times in interacting with various content providers. opponents of the legislation believe that content providers who support bandwidth-intensive applications should be required to pay service providers a premium in order to support further network investments. demand from carriers for the traffic management and subscriber management features of our products could be adversely affected if regulations prohibit, or limit, service providers from managing traffic on their networks. a decrease in demand for these features could adversely impact sales of our products.sales of our products to large service providers can involve a lengthy sales cycle, which may impact the timing of our revenues and result in us expending significant resources without making any sales. the length of our sales cycles to large service providers, including carriers and cable and mobile operators, is generally lengthy, as these end-customers undertake significant testing to assess the performance of our products within their networks. as a result, we may invest significant time from initial contact with a large service provider until that end-customer decides to incorporate our products in its network. we may also expend significant resources attempting to persuade large service providers to incorporate our products into their networks without success. even after deciding to purchase our products, initial network deployment of our products by a large service provider may last up to three years. carriers, especially in north america, often require that products they purchase meet network equipment building system (nebs) certification requirements, which relate the reliability of telecommunications equipment. our netenforcer ac-1000 and ac-2500 are designed to meet nebs certification requirements and are currently undergoing the certification process, but carriers may not choose to use our systems until we receive the certification. if a competitor succeeds in convincing a large service provider to adopt that competitors product, it may be difficult for us to displace the competitor because of the cost, time, effort and perceived risk to network stability involved in changing solutions. as a result we may incur significant expense without generating any sales.our revenues and business will be harmed if we do not keep pace with changes in broadband applications and with advances in technology. we will need to invest heavily in developing our dpi technology in order to keep pace with rapid changes in applications, increased broadband network speeds and with our competitors efforts to advance their technology. designers of broadband applications that our products are designed to identify and manage are using increasingly sophisticated methods to avoid detection and management by network operators. even if our products successfully identify a particular application, it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between different types of traffic belonging to a single application. accordingly, we face significant challenges in ensuring that we identify new applications as they are introduced without impacting network performance, especially as networks become faster. this challenge is increased as we seek to expand sales of our products in new geographic territories because the applications vary from country to country and region to region. if we fail to address the needs of customers in particular geographic markets and if we fail to develop enhancements to our products in order to keep pace with advances in technology, our business and revenues will be adversely affected.we currently depend on a single subcontractor, r.h. electronics ltd., to manufacture and provide hardware warranty support for our netenforcer traffic management system and if it experiences delays, disruptions, quality control problems or a loss in capacity, it could materially adversely affect our operating results. we currently depend on a single subcontractor, r.h.electronics ltd., to manufacture, assemble, test, package and provide hardware warranty support for all of our netenforcer traffic management systems, although we are negotiating with candidates for an additional third-party manufacturer. in addition, our agreement with r.h.electronics requires it to procure and store key components for the netenforcer at its facilities. if r.h.electronics experiences delays, disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing our products, or if we fail to effectively manage the relationship with r.h. electronics, shipments of products to our customers may be delayed and our ability to deliver products to customers could be materially adversely 10 affected. our agreement with r.h.electronics is automatically renewed annually for additional one-year terms, unless r.h.electronics elects not to renew by giving us at least 90days prior notice to the expiration of any such term. furthermore, r.h.electronics may terminate our agreement at any time during the term upon 120days prior notice. we expect that it would take approximately six months to transition manufacturing of our products to an alternate manufacturer and our inventory of completed products may not be sufficient for us to continue delivering products to our customers on a timely basis during any such transition. therefore, the loss of r.h.electronics would adversely affect our sales and operating results, and harm our reputation. r.h. electronics facilities are located in northern israel and are in range of rockets that were fired recently from lebanon into israel. in the event that the facilities of r.h.electronics are damaged as a result of hostile action, our ability to deliver products to customers could be materially adversely affected. see also risk factors conditions in israel could adversely affect our business, and our operations may be disrupted by the obligations of personnel to perform military service.certain components for our netenforcer traffic management systems come from single or limited sources, and we could lose sales if these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements. certain components used in our netenforcer systems are obtained from single or limited sources. since our netenforcer systems have been designed to incorporate these specific components, any change in these components due to an interruption in supply or our inability to obtain such components on a timely basis would require engineering changes to our products before we could incorporate substitute components. such changes could be costly and result in lost sales. in particular, the central processing unit for our netenforcer ac-400 and our netenforcer ac-800 is from intel corporation and the network processor for our netenforcer ac-1000 and our netenforcer ac-2500 is from hifn inc. if we or our contract manufacturer fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required, our business could be harmed. our suppliers also sell products to our competitors. our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price. our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of single-source or limited-sourced components, or to develop alternative sources for components or products would harm our ability to maintain and expand our business.the slowdown in capital expenditures by telecommunications service providers in prior years had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. another down turn in technology spending could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. a deterioration of economies around the world and economic uncertainty in the telecommunications market began in 2000 and continued through 2003. there was a curtailment of capital investment by telecommunications carriers and service providers as well as by businesses that use our products, referred to as the enterprise market. recent increased expenditures in the telecommunications industry in general or in the broadband portion of the market in particular may not continue. since a substantial portion of our operating expenses consist of salaries, we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses in line with any reduction in revenues or may elect not to do so for business reasons. we will need to continue to generate increased revenues and manage our costs to maintain profitability. any future industry downturn may increase our inventories, decrease our revenues, result in additional pressure on the price of our products and prolong the time until we are paid, all of which would have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and on our cash flow from operations.we use certain open-source software tools that carry the risk of being subject to intellectual property infringement claims, the assertion of which could impair our product development plans, interfere with our ability to support our customers or require us to pay licensing fees. our netenforcer traffic management systems and netxplorer management application suite contain software from open source code sources. open source code is software that is accessible, usable and modifiable by anyone, provided that users and modifiers abide by certain licensing requirements. the original 11 developers of the open source code provide no warranties on such code. our products include, for example, open source code such as the linux kernel and the gnu/linux operating system. the linux kernel and the gnu/linux operating system have been developed under a license (known as a general public license or gpl), which permits them to be liberally copied, modified and distributed. under certain conditions, the use of some open source code to create derivative code may obligate us to make the resulting derivative code available to others at no cost. the circumstances under which our use of open source code would compel us to offer derivative code at no cost are subject to different interpretations. while we have periodically undertaken reviews of our use of open source code in an effort to avoid situations that would require us to make parts of our core proprietary technology freely available as open source code, we cannot guarantee that such circumstances will not occur or that a court would not conclude that, under a different interpretation of an open source license, certain of our core technology must be made available as open source code. the use of such open source code may also ultimately require us to take remedial action, such as replacing certain code used in our products, paying a royalty to use some open source code, making certain proprietary source code available to others or discontinuing certain products, that may divert resources away from our development efforts. the license under which we licensed the linux kernel and gnu/linux operating system, is currently the subject of litigation in the case of the sco group, inc.v. international business machines corp., pending in the united states district court for the district of utah. sco filed its complaint in 2003. according to the current schedule, the parties will complete summary judgment briefing by december8, 2006 and the court has postponed the jury-trial date of february26, 2007, pending the outcome of the motions. sco has alleged that certain versions of the linux kernel and gnu/linux operating system contributed by ibm contain unauthorized unix code or derivative works of unix code, which sco claims it owns. if the court were to rule in scos favor and find, for example, that gnu/linux-based products, or significant portions of them, may not be liberally copied, modified or distributed, we may have to modify our products and/or seek a license to use the code in question, which may or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business. regardless of the merit of scos allegations, uncertainty concerning scos allegations could adversely affect our products and customer relationships.if we are unable to successfully protect the intellectual property embodied in our technology, our business could be harmed significantly. know-how relating to networking protocols, building carrier-grade systems and identifying applications is an important aspect of our intellectual property. to protect our know-how, we customarily require our employees, distributors, resellers, software testers and contractors to execute confidentiality agreements or agree to confidentiality undertakings when their relationship with us begins. typically, our employment contracts also include the following clauses: assignment of intellectual property rights for all inventions developed by employees, non-disclosure of all confidential information, and non-compete clauses for six months following termination of employment. the enforceability of non-compete clauses in israel is limited. we cannot provide any assurance that the terms of these agreements are being observed and will be observed in the future. because our product designs and software are stored electronically and thus are highly portable, we attempt to reduce the portability of our designs and software by physically protecting our servers through the use of closed networks, which prevent external access to our servers. we cannot be certain, however, that such protection will adequately deter individuals or groups from wrongful access to our technology. monitoring unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult, and some foreign laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the law of the united states. we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary information will be sufficient. in addition, to protect our intellectual property, we may become involved in litigation, which could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays, materially disrupt the conduct of our business or adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operations. as of september30, 2006, we had a limited patent portfolio. we had two issued u.s.patents and four pending u.s.patent applications. we also have one pending counterpart application outside of the united 12 states, filed pursuant to the patent cooperation treaty. while we plan to protect our intellectual property with, among other things, patent protection, there can be no assurance that: current or future u.s.or foreign patents applications will be approved; our issued patents will protect our intellectual property and not be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged by third parties; we will succeed in protecting our technology adequately in all key jurisdictions in which we or our competitors operate; the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business;or others will not independently develop similar or competing products or methods or design around any patents that may be issued to us. the failure to obtain patents, inability to obtain patents with claims of a scope necessary to cover our technology, or the invalidation of our patents, may weaken our competitive position and may adversely affect our revenues.we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties that, regardless of merit, could result in litigation and our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. there can be no assurance that we will not receive communications from third parties asserting that our products and other intellectual property infringe, or may infringe their proprietary rights. we are not currently subject to any proceedings for infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights and are not aware of any parties that intend to pursue such claims against us. any such claims, regardless of merit, could result in litigation, which could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays and materially disrupt the conduct of our business. as a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty-bearing licensing agreements, stop selling our products or re-brand our products. if it appears necessary, we may seek to license intellectual property that we are alleged to infringe. such licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. litigation is inherently uncertain and any adverse decision could result in a loss of our proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses from others and otherwise negatively affect our business. in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology, our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.our products are highly technical, and any undetected software or hardware errors in our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. our products are complex and are incorporated into broadband networks which are a major source of revenue for service providers and which support critical applications for subscribers and enterprises. due to the complexity of our products and variations among customers network environments, we may not detect product defects until full deployment in our customers networks. regardless of whether warranty coverage exists for a product, we may be required to dedicate significant technical resources to resolve any defects. if we encounter significant product problems, we could experience, among other things, loss of major customers, cancellation of product orders, increased costs, delay in recognizing revenue, and damage to our reputation. in addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty. defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert managements attention. in addition, if our business liability insurance is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition could be harmed. we need to increase the functionality of our products and offer additional features in order to maintain or increase our profitability. the market in which we operate is highly competitive and unless we continue to enhance the functionality of our products and add additional features, our competitiveness may be harmed and the average selling prices for our products may decrease over time. such a decrease would generally result from the introduction by competitors of competing products and from the standardization of dpi technology. to counter this trend, we endeavor to enhance our products by offering higher system speeds, and additional features, such as additional security functions, supporting additional applications and enhanced reporting tools. we may also need to reduce our per unit manufacturing costs at a rate equal to or faster than the rate at which selling prices decline. if we are unable to reduce these costs or to offer increased functionally and features, our profitability may be adversely affected.if we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, we may not be able to timely develop, sell or support our products. our success depends in large part on the continued contribution of our research and development, sales and marketing and managerial personnel. if our business continues to grow, we will need to hire additional qualified research and development, sales and marketing and managerial personnel to succeed. the process of hiring, training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operation is a lengthy and expensive one. the market for qualified personnel is very competitive because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills, sales skills and understanding of our products and technology. this is particularly true in israel, where competition for qualified personnel is intense. our failure to hire and retain qualified personnel could cause our revenues to decline and impair our ability to meet our research and development and sales objectives.the european union has issued directives relating to the sale in member countries of electrical and electronic equipment, including products sold by us. if our products fail to comply with these directives, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions that could materially adversely affect our business. a directive issued by the european union, or eu, on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, referred to as rohs, came into effect on july1, 2006. the rohs directive, lists a number of substances, including lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium, which must either be removed, or reduced to maximum permitted concentrations, in any products containing electrical or electronic components that are sold within the eu. our products fall within the scope of the rohs directive. we believe that our products are currently compliant with the rohs directive. there can, however, be no assurance that we will continue to comply with the rohs directive or any similar directives in other jurisdictions in the future. in 2003, the eu approved a directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, or weee, which promotes waste recovery with a view to reducing the quantity of waste for disposal and saving natural resources, in particular by reuse, recycling, composting and recovering energy from waste. the weee directive covers all electrical and electronic equipment used by consumers and electronic equipment intended for professional use. the directive, which went into effect in august 2005, requires that all new electrical and electronic equipment placed for sale in the eu be appropriately labeled regarding waste disposal and contains other obligations regarding the collection and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment. our products fall within the scope of the weee directive, with which we believe we are compliant and are taking all requisite steps to ensure continued compliance. the countries of the eu form the largest single market for our products. if our products fail to comply with weee or rohs directives, we could be subject to heavy penalties and other sanctions that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition. our international operations expose us to the risk of fluctuation in currency exchange rates. in 2005, we derived our revenues principally in u.s.dollars and to a lesser extent in euros and shekels. although a majority of our expenses were denominated in u.s.dollars, a significant portion of our expenses were denominated in shekels and to a lesser extent in euros and yen. our shekel-denominated expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses. we anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in shekels. if the u.s.dollar weakens against the shekel, there will be a negat</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This Prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements and information relating to the Company that are based on the beliefs of the Company's management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to the Company's management. When used in this Prospectus, words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend" and similar expressions, as they relate to the Company or its management, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current views of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, relating to the operations, results of operations and growth strategy of the Company, liquidity, competitive factors and pricing pressures, changes in legal and regulatory requirements, interest rate fluctuations, and general economic conditions, as well as other factors described in this Prospectus. Should one or more of the risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results or outcomes may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected or intended. See "Risk Factors." RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Prospectus, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business before purchasing shares of Common Stock offered hereby. Each of the following factors may have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, financial results, financial condition, liquidity, market valuation or market liquidity in future periods. GROWTH STRATEGYThe Company owns two state chartered banks operating in 13 locations in Arkansas. The Company's current growth strategy involves growth at existing offices and expansion via new, or de novo, branches into target Arkansas markets. This strategy involves certain special risks as follows: Acquisition and Development of Offices. The Company may encounter delays or other problems in opening offices currently under construction or in opening future offices. Although the Company has received regulatory approval and begun construction on two additional branch sites expected to open in the third quarter of 1997, there can be no assurance that these projects will be completed in a timely manner. Additionally, the Company may be unable to accomplish its future expansion plans due to lack of available satisfactory sites in suitable locations, difficulties in acquiring such sites, increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes, higher than anticipated acquisition costs or other factors.Regulatory and Economic Factors. The Company's growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect the Company's continued growth and expansion. Such factors may cause the Company to alter its growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process, which may prevent the Company from entering certain target markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in the Company's existing or expected markets.Operating Results. Even if the Company is successful in opening new offices, there is no assurance that such offices will achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profitability. The results achieved to date by the Company may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved from a larger number of locations. Should any new location be unprofitable or marginally profitable, or should any existing location experience a decline in profitability or incur losses, the adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be more significant than would be the case for a larger company. 6Management of Growth. The Company's past and expected growth involves a variety of risks including maintaining loan quality in the context of significant portfolio growth, maintaining adequate management personnel and systems to oversee such growth, maintaining adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions, and implementing additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth. Failure of the Company to successfully address these issues could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.See "Business--Growth Strategy." LIQUIDITY Banking Subsidiaries. The Company's primary sources of funds are customer deposits and loan repayments. The Company has experienced significant growth in its loan portfolio which has resulted in a high loan to deposit ratio (90.9% at March 31, 1997). While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, loans generally are not readily convertible to cash. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Accordingly, the Company may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility, unsecured and secured Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks. While management believes that these sources are currently adequate to meet the Company's liquidity requirements, there can be no assurance that they will be sufficient to meet long-term liquidity demands. The Company may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments should such sources not be adequate. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources."Holding Company. The Company has leveraged its investment in its subsidiary banks and depends upon the dividends paid to it, as sole stockholder thereof, as a principal source of funds for the Company's capital requirements. Federal and state banking regulations restrict the payment of dividends by the Company's subsidiary banks. Although management expects the level of dividends to be adequate to meet the Company's current and anticipated capital needs, including debt service requirements imposed by the Company's credit facility, the continued ability to pay dividends at adequate levels is determined primarily by the net profits, after taxes, of the banks. Accordingly, because there can be no assurance as to the future profitability of the banks, dividends from such banks may not be sufficient to meet the Company's future capital requirements. Also, there can be no assurance that additional federal or state regulations will not further restrict the banks' ability to pay dividends. Failure to receive sufficient dividends from subsidiary banks could result in defaults under the Company's credit facility or the inability of the Company to pay dividends to stockholders. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Supervision and Regulation--Subsidiary Banks." COMPETITIONThe banking industry in the Company's market area is highly competitive. In addition to competing with other commercial and savings banks and savings and loan associations, the Company competes with credit unions, finance companies, mortgage companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based non- bank lenders and many other financial and financial service institutions. A substantial number of the commercial banks operating in the Company's market area are branches or subsidiaries of much larger organizations affiliated with statewide, regional or national banking companies, and as a result may have greater resources and lower cost of funds than the Company. Additionally, the Company may face increased competition from de novo community banks, including those with senior management who were previously with other local banks or those controlled by investor groups with strong local business and community ties.Various legislative acts in recent years, including the interstate banking and branching laws, have led to increased competition among financial institutions. There can be no assurance that the Company will compete 7 effectively in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the United States Congress or the Arkansas General Assembly will not enact legislation that may further increase competitive pressures on the Company. See "Business--Competition" and "Supervision and Regulation." CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONSThe Company's profitability is dependent on the profitability of its subsidiary banks, which operate principally in northern, western and central Arkansas. The Company's loans are made primarily to borrowers who are residents of this area and are in substantial part secured by real estate collateral located in such area. Thus, in addition to adverse changes in general economic conditions in the United States such as inflation, recession and high unemployment, unfavorable changes in economic conditions affecting the Company's markets may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Such changes could result from, among other things, a reduction in real estate values, plant closings or layoffs, adverse trends or events affecting various major industry groups such as timber, cattle and poultry, inclement weather, natural disasters or other factors beyond the Company's control. INTEREST RATE RISKThe Company's earnings depend to a substantial extent on "rate differentials," i.e., the differences between the rates the Company earns on loans, securities and other earning assets, and the interest rates it pays to obtain deposits and other liabilities. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the Company's control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. From time to time, maturities of assets and liabilities may not be balanced, and an increase or decrease in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the net interest margin, results of operations and financial condition of the Company. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Interest Rate Sensitivity." RELIANCE ON KEY PERSONNELThe Company is dependent on the services of George Gleason, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Gleason is the largest individual stockholder of the Company, and although the Company has entered into an employment agreement with him, the loss of the services of Mr. Gleason could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also dependent on certain other key officers and members of management who have important customer relationships or are instrumental to the Company's operations. The loss of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain key personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to achieve and manage its planned growth. See "Business--Growth Strategy" and "Management." POSSIBLE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITALThe Company will use a portion of the proceeds of this offering, along with existing credit facilities, to capitalize its planned growth. However, there is no assurance that such proceeds and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the Company's future capital needs, and it may be necessary to seek additional capital through borrowings or additional equity. There is no assurance the Company will be able to obtain any such borrowings or additional equity and thus the Company may have to alter its planned growth and expansion. See "Use of Proceeds" and "Capitalization." REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTSThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision under various state and federal laws, rules and regulations, including rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and the Arkansas State Bank Department. These laws and regulations are designed primarily to protect depositors, borrowers, and the Bank Insurance Fund of the FDIC 8 and to further certain social policies; consequently, they may impose limitations on the Company that may not be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Company is subject to changes in federal and state laws, regulations, governmental policies and accounting principles. The effects of any such potential changes cannot be predicted, but they could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. See "Supervision and Regulation." ARKANSAS USURY LAWSThe Constitution of the State of Arkansas provides that "consumer loans and credit sales" have a maximum interest rate limitation of 17% per annum and that all "general loans" have a maximum limitation of 5% over the Federal Reserve Discount Rate in effect at the time the loan was made. The Arkansas Supreme Court has determined that "consumer loans and credit sales" are also "general loans" and are thus subject to an interest rate limitation equal to the lesser of 5% over the Federal Reserve Discount Rate or 17% per annum. The Arkansas Constitution provides significant penalties, including the forfeiture of interest and principal depending on the type of loans, for usurious loans. These usury provisions impose an artificial cap on the Company's net interest margin and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition to the extent that the Federal Reserve Discount Rate fails to move in tandem with market rates or that a high interest rate environment reduces or eliminates the Company's net interest margin. See "Supervision and Regulation--State Regulations." CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIPFollowing completion of this offering, George Gleason will beneficially own approximately 36.4%, and the Company's directors and executive officers as a group (including Mr. Gleason) will beneficially own approximately 45.2% (not including any shares purchased in or after the offering) of the Company's outstanding Common Stock. Additionally, the Company's Stock Ownership Plan and Trust for employees (the "ESOP") will beneficially own approximately 10.4% of the Company's Common Stock following completion of this offering. Accordingly, Mr. Gleason and certain employees may have the ability to determine the election of the Company's directors and control corporate actions which are submitted to stockholders. See "Principal and Selling Stockholders." ABSENCE OF PUBLIC MARKET AND POSSIBLE VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICEPrior to this offering, there has been no public market for the shares of the Company's Common Stock. Although the Common Stock has been approved for trading on The Nasdaq National Market, there can be no assurance that an active market for the Common Stock will develop or be sustained following completion of this offering. The initial public offering price was determined through negotiations between the Company and the Representative of the Underwriters and may not be indicative of the market price for the shares of Common Stock following completion of this offering. Additionally, the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume volatility. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies whose shares are traded. Market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. A variety of events, including regulatory developments, quarterly variations in operating results, news announcements, trading volume, general market trends and other factors could result in fluctuations in the price of the Common Stock, and there can be no assurance that the market price of the Common Stock will not decline below the initial public offering price. See "Underwriting." SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALESales of a substantial number of previously issued shares of the Company's Common Stock in the public market following completion of this offering could adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. Including the shares offered hereby, approximately 1,774,700 shares of Common Stock will be eligible for sale immediately following completion of this offering, and approximately 11,900 shares of Common Stock will become eligible for sale in the public market upon expiration of the 90-day period immediately following 9 effectiveness of the Company's registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), subject to compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Rule 144. Further, following expiration or release from the 180-day lock-up agreements with the Underwriters, approximately 1,793,200 additional shares of Common Stock will be eligible for sale in accordance with SEC Rule 144. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale" and "Underwriting." CERTAIN CHARTER AND BYLAW PROVISIONSThe Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation contain certain provisions that could delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control of the Company. These provisions include (i) the option for the Board of Directors to classify or stagger the Board of Directors into two or three classes with each class having staggered terms; (ii) a provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders; and (iii) a provision that directors may be removed only for cause, and then only by the two-thirds vote of stockholders. The Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation also allow the Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock, $.01 par value (the "Preferred Stock") with rights superior to those of the Common Stock. This provision could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, control of the Company without approval of the Company's Board of Directors, and could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Common Stock. See "Description of Capital Stock." DIVIDEND POLICYThe Company currently pays a cash dividend on its Common Stock. The Company's ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to regulatory requirements and other conditions existing at the time, including the Company's profitability, liquidity, financial condition and capital requirements. Additionally, the payment of dividends is subject to restrictions imposed by federal and state banking laws, regulations and authorities. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to pay cash dividends on its Common Stock. See "Dividend Policy" and "Supervision and Regulation." 10</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS Before you invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the various risks, including those described below, together with all of the other information included in this prospectus. Risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could cause our sales revenues to decreaseOur sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we were to lose one or more of these customers, or if one or more of these customers were to delay or reduce purchases of our products, our sales revenues may decrease. For the six months ended June 30, 1999, approximately 81% of our revenues were generated by five of our customers, and revenues derived from sales to Talent Trade Asia, TriGem and Silicon Application Corporation accounted for 42%, 20% and 10%, respectively, of our product sales. For the year ended December 31, 1998, approximately 60% of our revenues were generated by five of our customers, and revenues derived from sales to Silicon Application Corporation, BTC, Askey Computer and Zoltrix accounted for 15%, 13%, 12% and 12%, respectively, of our product sales. These customers may in the future decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns, because: . we do not have any long-term purchase arrangements or contracts with these or any of our other customers, . our product sales to date have been made primarily on a purchase order basis, which permit our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice and without penalty, and . many of our customers also have pre-existing relationships with current or potential competitors which may affect our customers' purchasing decisionsWe expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next 12 to 18 months and that a significant portion of our sales will continue to be made on the basis of purchase orders. We have significant sales and operations concentrated in Asia. Continued political and economic instability in Asia and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase market demand for our productsOur sales to customers located in Asia accounted for 74%, 77% and 76% of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively, and 77% and 99% of total revenues in the six months ended June 30, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The predominance of our sales are in Asia, mostly in Taiwan and China, because our customers are primarily motherboard or modem manufacturers that are located there. In many cases, our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers specify that our products be included on the modem boards or motherboards, the main printed circuit board containing the central processing unit of a computer system, that they purchase from board manufacturers, and we sell our products directly to the board manufacturers for resale to our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers. Industry statistics indicate that approximately two thirds of modems manufactured in Asia are sold back to original equipment manufacturers located in the United States. Due to the industry-wide concentration of modem manufacturers in Asia, we believe 7 that a high percentage of our future sales will continue to be concentrated with Asian customers. As a result, our future operating results could be uniquely affected by a variety of factors outside of our control, including: . political and economic instability, such as the recent political instability in Indonesia and the economic turmoil in Japan, . changes in tariffs, quotas, import restrictions and other trade barriers which may make our products more expensive compared to our competitors, . delays in collecting accounts receivable, which we have experienced from time to time, and . fluctuations in the value of Asian currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which may make it more costly for us to do business in Asia which may in turn make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our revenuesTo successfully expand our sales in Asia and internationally, we must strengthen foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international distributors and resellers. This will require significant management attention and financial resources. To the extent that we are unable to effect these additions in a timely manner, we may not be able to maintain or increase market demand for our products in Asia and internationally, and our operating results could be hurt. The recent earthquake in Taiwan and subsequent aftershocks may cause our revenues or profitability to decreaseBecause our products are sold to motherboard or modem manufacturer customers in Taiwan, the recent earthquake in Taiwan may result in less demand for our products and may cause our revenues to decrease. Our customers who are outside of Taiwan may also be dependent on other components manufactured in Taiwan. The recent earthquake may disrupt the operations of our customers' other suppliers who are located in Taiwan, and may result in a decrease in demand of our products. We are also dependent on our suppliers who manufacture product components in Taiwan. The recent earthquake may disrupt the operations of these suppliers. If they are not able to adequately supply us, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products. We do not currently believe that the effect of this earthquake on our business will be material. However, due to the nature of this disaster and the fact that its full impact on our business has not been fully evaluated, our sales to customers in Asia may be affected in the next few quarters. Continuing decreases in the average selling prices of our products could result in decreased revenuesProduct sales in the connectivity industry have been characterized by continuing erosion of average selling prices. Price erosion experienced by any company can cause revenues and gross margins to decline. The average selling price of our products has decreased by approximately 40% from October 1995 to June 30, 1999. We expect this trend to continueIn addition, we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards in the soft modem industry is likely to further erode average selling prices, particularly for analog modems. Adoption of industry standards is driven by the market requirement to have interoperable modems. End users need this interoperability to ensure modems from different manufacturers communicate with each other without problems. Historically, users have deferred purchasing modems until these industry standards are adopted. However, once these standards are accepted, it lowers the barriers to entry and price erosion has resulted. Decreasing average selling prices in our products could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units that we sell increases. Therefore, we must continue to develop and introduce next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins. Our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margin to decline. Our gross margins may vary based on the mix of sales of our products and services, and these variations may hurt our net incomeWe derive a significant portion of our sales from our software-based connectivity products. We expect margins on newly introduced products generally to be higher than our existing products. However, due in part to 8 the competitive pricing pressures that affect our products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs, we expect margins from both existing and future products to decrease over time. In addition, licensing revenues from our products historically have provided higher margins than of our product sales. Changes in the mix of products sold and the percentage of our sales in any quarter attributable to products as compared to licensing revenues will cause our quarterly results to vary and could result in a decrease in net income. Our revenues may fluctuate each quarter due to both domestic and international seasonal trendsWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in sales of our connectivity products. These seasonal trends materially affect our quarter-to-quarter operating results. Our revenues are higher during the back- to-school and holiday seasons which fall in the third and fourth calendar quarters. Revenue in our third and fourth quarters are typically higher relative to other quarters because many purchasers of PCs make purchase decisions based on their calendar year-end budgeting requirements. As a result, we generally expect revenue levels for the first quarter to be less than those for the preceding quarterWe are currently expanding our sales in international markets, particularly in Asia, Europe and South America. We expect our third quarter to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity and spending activity generally associated with that time of year, particularly in Europe. To the extent that our revenues in Asia, Europe or other parts of the world increase in future periods, we expect our period-to-period revenues to reflect seasonal buying patterns in these markets. Any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in customers cancelling purchases of our productsSales cycles for our products with major customers are lengthy, often lasting six months or longer. In addition, it can take an additional six months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products. Sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons: . our original equipment manufacturer customers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products, over which we have no control, before placing a purchase order, . the commercial integration of our products by an original equipment manufacturer is typically limited during the initial release to evaluate product performance, and . the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayedA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders. The lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases. If customer cancellations or product changes were to occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses. We expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future and these increased expenses may diminish our ability to remain profitableAlthough we have been profitable in recent years, we may not remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially over at least the next three years as we: . further develop and introduce new applications and functionality for our host signal processing technology, . explore emerging product opportunities in digital technologies and wireless and cable communications, . expand our distribution channels, both domestically and in our international markets, and . pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions. 9 In order to maintain profitability we will be required to increase our revenues to meet these additional expenses. Any failure to significantly increase our revenues as we implement our product, service, distribution and strategic relationship strategies would result in a decrease in our overall revenuesTo date, we have principally relied upon our distributor sales organization for product sales to smaller accounts. Our direct sales efforts have focused principally on board manufacturers and smaller PC original equipment manufacturers. To increase penetration of our target customer base, including large, tier-one original equipment manufacturers, we must significantly increase the size of our direct sales force and organize and deploy sales teams targeted at specific domestic tier-one original equipment manufacturer accounts. If we are unable to expand our sales to additional original equipment manufacturers, our revenues may not meet analysts' expectations which could cause our stock price to drop. We must accurately forecast our customer demand for our modem products. If there is an unexpected fluctuation in demand for our products, we may incur excessive operating costs or lose product revenuesWe must forecast and place purchase orders for specialized semiconductor chips, the application specific integrated circuit, coder/decoder and discrete access array, or data access arrangement, components of our modem products, several months before we receive purchase orders from our own customers. This forecasting and order lead time requirement limits our ability to react to unexpected fluctuations in demand for our products. These fluctuations can be unexpected and may cause us to have excess inventory, or a shortage, of a particular product. In the event that our forecasts are inaccurate, we may need to write down excess inventory. For example, we were required to write down inventory in the second quarter of 1996 in connection with a product transition within our 14.4 Kbps product family. Similarly, if we fail to purchase sufficient supplies on a timely basis, we may incur additional rush charges or we may lose product revenues if we are not able to meet a purchase order. These failures could also adversely affect our customer relations. Significant write- downs of excess inventory or declines in inventory value in the future could cause our net income and gross margin to decrease. We rely heavily on our intellectual property rights which offer only limited protection against potential infringers. Unauthorized use of our technology may result in development of products that compete with our products which could cause our market share and our revenues to be reducedOur success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. These means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate. We hold a total of 32 patents, a number of which cover technology that is considered essential for International Telecommunications Union standard communications solutions, and also have 26 additional patent applications pending or filed. These patents may never be issued. These patents, both issued and pending, may not provide sufficiently broad protection against third party infringement lawsuits or they may not prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Other than the Motorola and ESS lawsuits described elsewhere in this prospectus, to date, no material lawsuits relating to intellectual property have been filed against usDespite precautions that we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may provide our licensees with access to our proprietary information underlying our licensed applications. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology. Finally, policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and some foreign laws, including those of various countries in Asia, do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as United States laws. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resourcesWe have received, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. These claims could affect our relationships with existing customers and may prevent potential future customers from purchasing our products or licensing our 10 technology. Because we depend upon a limited number of products, any claims of this kind, whether they are with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In the event that we do not prevail in litigation, we could be prevented from selling our products or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms which may not be acceptable to us. We could also be prevented from selling our products or be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Should we cross license our intellectual property in order to obtain licenses, we may no longer be able to offer a unique productNew patent applications may be currently pending or filed in the future by third parties covering technology that we use currently or may use in the future. Pending U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents are issued, and thus it is impossible to ascertain all possible patent infringement claims against us. We believe that several of our competitors, including Motorola, Lucent and ESS Technology, may have a strategy of protecting their market share by filing intellectual property claims against their competitors and may assert claims against us in the future. The legal and other expenses and diversion of resources associated with any such litigation could result in a decrease in our revenuesIn addition, some of our customer agreements include an indemnity clause that obligates us to defend and pay all damages and costs finally awarded by a court should third parties assert patent and/or copyright claims against our customers. As a result, we may be held responsible for infringement claims asserted against our customers. If our financial reserves for potential future license fees are less than any actual fees that we are required to pay, our net income would be reducedWe have established and recorded on a monthly basis a financial per-unit reserve for payment of future license fees based upon our estimate as to the likely amount of the licensing fees that we may be required to pay in the event that licenses are obtained. We believe that it is typical for participants in the modem industry to obtain licenses in exchange for grants of cross licenses rather than for payment of fees and we have based our estimates on our understanding of the license fee practices of other segments of our industry. Our reserves may not be adequate because of factors outside of our control and because these license fee practices in the modern industry may not be applicable to our experience. Competition in the connectivity market is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for, or the prices of, our products may be reducedThe connectivity device market is intensely competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors. Our current competitors include 3Com, Conexant, ESS Technology, Lucent Technologies and Motorola. Motorola introduced soft modems in the third quarter of 1998 and Conexant introduced soft modems in the fourth quarter of 1998. We expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors enhance their product offerings, new suppliers enter the connectivity device market, new communication technologies are introduced and additional networks are deployedWe may in the future also face competition from other suppliers of products based on host signal processing technology or on new or emerging communication technologies, which may render our existing or future products obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. We believe that these competitors may include Alcatel, Analog Devices, Aware, Broadcom, Com21, Efficient Networks, Orckit, Terayon Communications and Texas InstrumentsWe believe that the principal competitive factors required by users and customers in the connectivity product market include compatibility with industry standards, price, functionality, ease of use and customer service and support. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. 11 We recently hired a new President and Chief Operating Officer. If he is not successful in carrying out his duties, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability or increase our revenueIn August 1999, we hired William F. Roach as our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Roach must be successfully integrated into our organizational structure. If for any reason Mr. Roach does not successfully carry out his duties or lead our organization in an effective manner, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability or increase our revenue. In order for us to maintain our profitability and continue to introduce and develop new products for emerging markets, we must attract and retain our executive officers and qualified technical, sales, support and other administrative personnelOur past performance has been and our future performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive officers and certain key engineering, sales, marketing, financial, technical and customer support personnel. If we lost the services of one or more of our executives or key employees, a replacement could be difficult to recruit and we may not be able to grow our businessWe maintain "key person" life insurance policies on Peter Chen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, William Wen-Liang Hsu, our Vice President, Engineering, and Han Yeh, our Vice President, Technology, in the face amount of $1 million for each individual. However, these insurance policies may not adequately compensate for the loss of services of any of these individualsWe intend to hire a significant number of additional engineering, sales, support, marketing and finance personnel in the future. Competition for personnel, especially engineers and marketing and sales personnel in Silicon Valley, is intense. We are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education, backgrounds and industry experience. As of June 30, 1999, we employed a total of 58 people in our engineering department, over half of whom have advanced degrees. In the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified engineering personnel, especially developers, on a timely basis. If we are not able to hire at the levels that we plan, our ability to continue to develop products and technologies responsive to our markets will be impaired. We have experienced significant growth in our business in recent periods and failure to manage our growth could strain our management, financial and administrative resourcesOur ability to successfully sell our products and implement our business plan in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective management planning process. Future expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on our management by significantly increasing the scope of their responsibilities and resources by increasing the number of people using them. We have increased, and plan to continue to increase, the scope of our operations at a rapid rate. Our headcount has grown and will continue to grow substantially. At December 31, 1998, we had a total of 95 employees and at June 30, 1999, we had a total of 125 employees. In addition, we expect to continue to hire a significant number of new employees. To effectively manage our growth, we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls, integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. We rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test our products. If these companies do not meet their commitments to us, our ability to sell products to our customers would be impairedWe do not have our own manufacturing, assembling or testing operations. Instead, we rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test the semiconductor chips which are integral components of our products. Most of these companies are located outside of the United States. There are many risks associated with our relationships with these independent companies, including reduced control over: . delivery schedules, . quality assurance, 12 . manufacturing costs, . capacity during periods of excess demand, and . availability of access to process technologiesIn addition, the location of these independent parties outside of the United States creates additional risks resulting from the foreign regulatory, political and economic environments in which each of these companies exists. While to date we have not experienced any material problems, failures or delays by our manufacturers to provide the semiconductor chips that we require for our products, or any material change in the financial arrangements we have with these companies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer product requirementsWe design, market and sell application specific integrated circuits and outsource the manufacturing and assembly of the integrated circuits to a third party fabrication. The majority of our products and related components are manufactured by five principal companies: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, ST Microelectronics, Kawasaki/LSI, Silicon Labs and Delta Integration. We expect to continue to rely upon these third parties for these services. Currently, the data access arrangement chips used in our soft modem products are provided by a sole source, Silicon Labs, on a purchase order basis, and we have only a limited guaranteed supply arrangement under a contract with our supplier. We are currently in the process of qualifying a second source for our data access arrangement chips. Although we believe that we would be able to qualify an alternative manufacturing source for data access arrangement chips within a relatively short period of time, this transition, if necessary, could result in loss of purchase orders or customer relationships, which could result in decreased revenues. Undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance of our productsOur products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released. To date, we have not been made aware of any significant software errors or failures in our products. However, despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance. If we, our key suppliers or our customers fail to be ready for the year 2000 calendar change, our business may be disrupted and our net revenues may declineThe Year 2000 issue refers to computer programs which use two digits rather than four to define a given year and which might read a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the Year 2000. As a result, many companies' systems and software may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to function correctly after December 31, 1999Our Software. Our connectivity products are incorporated into computer products of our customers which may not be Year 2000 compliant, or which may be perceived by their markets as not meeting Year 2000 compliance requirements. As a result, it is likely that any failure of the computer products into which our products may be incorporated to be Year 2000 compliant, or any slowdown in the connectivity markets as a result of Year 2000 compliance concerns, will hurt our product sales. In addition, we believe that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by Year 2000 issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or upgrade their current software systems for Year 2000 compliance. These expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase our products. To the extent Year 2000 issues cause a significant delay in, or cancellation of, decisions to purchase our products or services, our business would suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we test and evaluate our software modems. We believe that our current products are Year 2000 compliant, meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after January 1, 2000 will not materially affect the performance of our software products or the ability of our products to transmit data involving dates. 13 Third Party Equipment And Software. We use third party equipment and software that may not be Year 2000 compliant. This equipment and software includes our key internal systems such as for our internal accounting systems or controls. If this equipment or software does not operate properly with regard to the Year 2000, we may incur unexpected expenses to remedy any problems. These costs may materially adversely affect our business. In addition, if our key internal systems fail as a result of Year 2000 problems, we could incur substantial costs and disruption of our businessCompliance. Despite our current assessment, we may not identify and correct all significant Year 2000 problems on a timely basis. Year 2000 compliance efforts may involve significant time and expense and unremediated problems could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We currently do not have any estimate of potential costs related to potential Year 2000 problems. We currently do not have plans to contact our material customers. We currently have no contingency plans to address the risks associated with unremediated Year 2000 problems. To date, we have not incurred any material costs directly associated with Year 2000 compliance efforts, except for compensation expense associated with salaried employees who have devoted some of their time to Year 2000 assessment and remediation efforts. We do not expect the total cost of Year 2000 problems to be material to our business, financial condition or operating results. However, during the months prior to the century change, we will continue to evaluate new versions of our products, new software and information systems provided by third parties and any new infrastructure systems that we acquire, to determine whether they are Year 2000 compliant. Risks Related to Our Industry If the market for applications using our host signal processing technology does not grow as we anticipate, or if our products are not accepted in this market, our revenues may stagnate and may decreaseOur success depends on the growth of the market for applications using our host signal processing technology. This market has only recently begun to develop and may not develop at the growth rates that have been suggested by industry estimates. Market demand for host signal processing technology depends primarily upon the cost and performance benefits relative to other competing solutions. For example, soft modems have only recently begun to gain acceptance in the modem market. Although we have shipped a significant number of soft modems since we began commercial sales of these products in October 1995, the current level of demand for soft modems may not be sustained or may not grow. If customers do not accept soft modems or the market for soft modems does not grow, our revenues will decreaseFurther, we are in the process of developing next generation products and applications which improve and extend upon our host signal processing technology, such as a G.Lite modem solution, an external modem product and a remote access solution. If these products are not accepted in our markets when they are introduced, our revenues and profitability will be negatively affected. Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies. If we do not adapt to these technologies, our products will become obsoleteThe connectivity product mark</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all of the other information included in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any of the following risks could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate or materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition and could result in a complete loss of your investment. Risks Related to our Business We are not profitable and do not expect to achieve profitability in the near future, if at allWe have not achieved profitability. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We incurred net losses of $321,000 from inception through December 31, 1997. For the year ended December 31, 1998, we incurred additional net losses of $5.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, we incurred additional net losses of $16.0 million and had an accumulated deficit of $21.6 million as of September 30, 1999, and we expect to report additional net losses for the period since September 30, 1999Our business plan calls for us to continue to acquire and invest in operating companies. As a result, we will continue to amortize substantial amounts of goodwill. As we grow, we expect that the amount of goodwill we will amortize in connection with these investments will represent an increasingly smaller portion of our expenses. Therefore, we expect to continue to incur net losses until that point in time when the goodwill we amortize represents a sufficiently small amount of our expenses that it is exceeded by our net income before amortization. Because we cannot predict the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we do not know when we will become profitable, if ever. We have a history of negative cash flow, and we may never achieve positive cash flowFor the year ended December 31, 1998, we had losses from operations, before depreciation and amortization, of $4.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, we had losses from operations, before depreciation and amortization, of $9.0 million, and we expect to report additional losses for the period since September 30, 1999. Additionally, we used $14.3 million in 1998 and $61.3 million in the first nine months of 1999 to acquire operations and fixed assets. If we are unable to increase our revenue to cover our costs and investment expenditures, we will continue to experience negative cash flow. For information regarding our expected losses for the three months ended December 31, 1999, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis--Recent Developments" on page 24. We may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to execute our business planWe expect that the net proceeds of this offering will fund our operations for the next 12 months. After we have used the net proceeds from this offering, we will need to obtain additional debt or equity financings to fund operations, capital expenditures for expansion of network and information systems, and acquisitions. If we obtain debt financings, we may be required to agree to restrictions on our activities that could impair our ability to execute our business plan. For example, these restrictions may prohibit us from incurring additional debt or making acquisitions without prior lender approval. If we obtain additional equity financings, the per share value of our outstanding common stock may be diluted. In general, if we are unable to obtain these financings on favorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plan. Our combined operating history is limited and may not be indicative of our future performanceAlthough a number of the operating companies we have acquired have been in operation for some time, VIA itself has a limited history of operations. Consequently, the financial information in this prospectus may not be indicative of our future performance. 6 Because we have grown rapidly and we expect our growth to continue, we may have difficulty managing our growth effectively, which could adversely affect the quality of our services and the results of our operationsWe have grown rapidly and expect to continue to grow rapidly by acquiring new companies, increasing the number of customers served and increasing the number and types of products and services we offer. We have acquired 19 companies since June 1998, and agreed to acquire one other company, and the total number of our employees grew from five to 903 between June 1, 1998 and January 14, 2000. To manage our expected growth effectively, we must . implement additional management information systems . develop additional operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls . hire and train additional personnelIf we are unable to meet these demands, the quality of our services may suffer, causing us to lose customers and revenues. If we fail to integrate operating systems, networks and management of our acquired companies successfully, we may suffer operating inefficiencies and reduced operating cash flow We may not be able to integrate our acquired companies successfully because we currently operate in 12 different countries with different governmental regulations, languages, customs, currencies and availabilities of telecommunication capacity to carry data. We will have to commit substantial management, operating, financial and other resources to integrate our operating companies and implement our business model, which will reduce our operating cash flow. Because we operate in markets where extended vacations are typical, and since in some of these markets, we receive a portion of our revenues based on customer usage, we may experience seasonal variation in our quarterly revenue and operating results that could cause our stock price to declineIn Europe and Latin America, four or more weeks of vacation is typical and often mandated under law. As a result, extended summer and winter holiday vacations are common and it is difficult to attract new customers during these periods. In these markets, our customers also pay their telephone companies for the number of minutes they spend on-line, even if we provide a local telephone number that they can use for access. We may receive a portion of these fees from the telephone companies as payment for generating usage, and customer usage generally declines in the summer months, July and August in Europe and January and February in Latin America, and in December. As a result, we may experience lower revenues during these periods and our operating results may be affected. To the extent our quarterly results fluctuate more widely than expected by us, securities analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. We face increasing competition for the purchase of local Internet services providers, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitionsOur business strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to identify and acquire new local Internet services providers that meet our acquisition criteria. In pursuing these opportunities, we compete with other Internet services providers, local, regional, national and global telecommunication companies and other buyers. These competitors may drive up the price of our acquisition targets or may acquire our acquisition targets. Many of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than we have. Increasing competition has raised the price we have paid for acquisitions in some markets and may continue to do so. In addition, our acquisition targets may find our competitors more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. 7 Financial information on which we rely to make future acquisitions may not be accurate, which may result in our acquiring undisclosed liabilities or experiencing lower than expected operating resultsThe companies we target for acquisition typically do not have audited financial statements and have varying degrees of internal controls and detailed financial information. As a result, we may acquire undisclosed liabilities or experience lower-than-expected revenues or higher-than-expected costs, which could adversely affect our operating results. To date, no issues of this kind have arisen that have materially adversely affected our results; however, they may arise in the future. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the various currencies in which we conduct business may affect our operating resultsWe record the revenues and expenses of our local operations in their home currencies and translate these amounts into U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues, expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations may adversely affect the comparability of period-to-period results. For example, the value of the Brazilian Real fluctuated by 45.6% in relation to the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and ended the period 37.2% lower than its value to the U.S. dollar in the beginning of the year. Since each Real converted to fewer U.S. dollars, our U.S. dollar revenue was reduced. In the past, the currencies of many Latin American countries, including Brazil and Mexico in particular, have experienced substantial devaluation and volatility. Our Latin American markets have a history of political and economic instability which may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our resultsWe derive and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from the Latin American markets. Latin America has experienced periods of political and economic instability. If these conditions were to reoccur, our business could be adversely affected. Historically, instability in Latin American countries has been caused by . extensive governmental involvement, control or ownership of industries in local economies, including telecommunications facilities, financial institutions and other commerce infrastructure . unexpected changes in regulatory requirements such as imposing licensing requirements or levying new taxes . slow or negative growth as a result of recessionary trends caused by foreign currency devaluations, interest rate hikes and inflation . imposition of trade barriers through trade restrictions, high tariffs and taxes . wage and price controls that reduce potential profitability of businesses Any occurrence of adverse political and economic conditions may deter growth in Internet usage or create uncertainty regarding our operating climate, which my adversely impact our business. Currently, we do not have political risk insurance to guard against business interruptions and other losses caused by political acts. Logistical problems or economic downturns that could result from the introduction of the Euro may affect our ability to operate and adversely impact our operating resultsOn January 1, 1999, 11 of the 15 European Union member countries adopted the Euro as their common legal currency, at which time their respective individual currencies became fixed at a rate of exchange to the Euro, and the Euro became a currency in its own right. During a January 1, 1999 to January 1, 2002 transition period, we must manage transactions with our customers and our third-party vendors who conduct business in Euro participating countries in both the Euro and the individual currencies. If we, our customers or our vendors experience systems problems in converting to the Euro, we could be unable to bill and collect from customers or pay vendors for services, and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. 8The establishment of the European Monetary Union may have a significant effect on the economies of the participant countries. Since a substantial portion of our revenue will be denominated in the Euro or currencies of European Union countries, our operating results could be adversely affected if there is a downturn in the economies of participating countries or if the Euro weakens against other currencies. Our brand names are difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third partiesWe are aware of other companies using or claiming to have rights to use our trademarks and variations of those marks, including the VIA NET.WORKS mark. In particular, one company has notified us that it believes our use of the VIA NET.WORKS mark in Brazil infringes upon its trademark applications. The users of these or similar marks may be found to have senior rights if they were ever to assert a claim against us for trademark infringement. If an infringement suit were instituted against us, even if groundless, it could result in substantial litigation expenses in defending the suit. If such a suit were to be successful, we could be forced to cease using the mark and to pay damagesWe have applied to register several of our trademarks in various countries. Our application to register in Argentina the trademark "VIA Net Works Argentina" has been opposed by a third party. If any of our applications are unsuccessful, we may be required to discontinue the use of those trademarks. Risks Related to our Industry Regulatory and economic conditions of the countries where our operating companies are located are uncertain and may decrease demand for our services, increase our cost of doing business or otherwise reduce our business prospectsOur operating companies are located in countries with rapidly changing regulatory and economic conditions which may affect the Internet services industry. Any new law or regulation pertaining to the Internet or telecommunications, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, could decrease demand for our services, increase our costs or otherwise reduce our profitability or business prospects. Specific examples of the types of laws or regulations that could adversely affect us include laws that . impose taxes on transactions made over the Internet . impose telecommunications access fees on Internet services providers . directly or indirectly affect telecommunications costs generally or the costs of Internet telecommunications specifically . prohibit the transmission over the Internet of various types of information and content . impose requirements on Internet services providers to protect Internet users' privacy or to permit government interception of data traffic . increase the likelihood or scope of competition from telecommunications or cable companiesFor example, some states of Brazil impose a tax of up to 30% on revenues generated by communications services. There has been no judicial determination that Internet access services constitute communications services. If Internet services providers are ultimately required to pay this tax, our Brazilian operations would be negatively and significantly impactedThese laws could require us to incur costs to comply with them or to incur new liability. They could also increase our competition or change our competitive environment so that customer demand for our products and services is affected. For a discussion of specific regulatory proposals that may affect our business, see "Business--Regulatory Matters."In addition to risks we face from new laws or regulations, we face uncertainties in connection with the application of existing laws to the Internet. It may take years to determine the manner in which existing laws 9 governing issues like property ownership, libel, negligence and personal privacy will be applied to communications and commerce over the Internet. Increasing competition for customers in our markets may cause us to reduce our prices or increase spending, which may negatively affect our revenues and operating resultsThere are competitors in our markets with more significant market presence and brand recognition and greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. As a result of this competition, we currently face and expect to continue to face significant pressure to reduce our prices and improve the products and services we offer. Although the competitors we face vary depending on the market and the country, these competitors may include local and regional Internet services providers, telecommunication companies and cable companies. Some of our competitors, especially the telecommunications companies, have large networks in place as well as a significant existing customer base. If demand for Internet services in our markets does not grow as we expect, our ability to grow our revenues will be negatively affectedInternet use in our markets is relatively low. If the market for Internet services fails to develop, or develops more slowly than expected, we may not be able to increase our revenues. Obstacles to the development of Internet services in our markets include: . low rates of personal computer ownership and usage . lack of developed infrastructure to develop Internet access and applications . limited access to Internet servicesIn particular, we depend on increasing demand for Internet services by small to mid-sized businesses in our geographic markets. Demand for Internet services by these businesses will depend partly on the degree to which these businesses' customers and suppliers adopt the Internet as a means of doing business, and partly on the extent to which these businesses adopt Internet technologies to deal with internal business processes, such as internal communications. We are in a rapidly evolving industry in which the products and services we offer, their methods of delivery and their underlying technologies are changing rapidly, and if we do not keep pace with these changes, we may fail to retain and attract customers, which would reduce our revenuesThe Internet services market is characterized by changing customer needs, frequent new service and product introductions, evolving industry standards and rapidly changing technology. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to recognize and respond to these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we fail to do so, we will not be able to compete successfully. We rely on telecommunications companies in our markets to provide our customers with reliable access to our services, and failures or delays in providing access could limit our ability to service our customers and impact our revenues and operating resultsOur customers access our services either through their normal telephone lines or dedicated lines provided by local telecommunications companies specifically for that use. In some of our markets, we experience delays in delivery of new telephone lines that have prevented our customers from accessing our services. These delays result in lost revenues. Additionally, some local telecommunications companies that provide Internet services provide delivery of telephone or dedicated lines to their Internet customers on a preferential basis, which may cause us to lose current and potential customers. We also lease network capacity from telecommunications companies and rely on the quality and availability of their service. These companies may experience disruptions of service which could disrupt our services to, or limit Internet access for, our customers. We may 10 not be able to replace or supplement these services on a timely basis or in a cost-effective manner, which may result in customer dissatisfaction and lost revenues. We depend on the reliability of our network, and a system failure or a breach of our security measures could result in a loss of customers and reduced revenuesWe are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damages from telecommunication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters and unauthorized access. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could impair our ability to provide Internet services to our customers and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers' data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches. Although we currently possess errors and omissions insurance and business interruption insurance, these policies may not provide effective coverage upon the occurrence of all events. We do not have insurance specifically to guard against losses resulting from computer viruses and security breaches. If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or lose the services of our key personnel, our operating results may sufferOur success depends on our key management, engineers, sales and marketing personnel, technical support representatives and other personnel, many of whom may be difficult to replace. If we lose key personnel, we may not be able to find suitable replacements, which may negatively affect our business. In addition, since the demand for qualified personnel in our industry is very high, we may have to increase the salaries and fringe benefits we may offer to our personnel, which may affect our operating results. We do not maintain key person life insurance on, or restrictive employment agreements with, any of our executive officers. We may be liable for information disseminated over our networkWe may face liability for information carried on or disseminated through our network. Some types of laws that may result in our liability for information disseminated over our network include: . laws designed to protect intellectual property, including trademark and copyright laws . laws relating to publicity and privacy rights and laws prohibiting defamation . laws restricting the collection, use and processing of personal data and . laws prohibiting the sale, dissemination or possession of pornographic materialThe laws governing these matters vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For information about the applicable laws that may affect our liability for information carried or disseminated through our network, see "Business-- Regulatory Matters." The availability of protection for intellectual property rights in the context of the Internet remains uncertain We rely on trademark and copyright law, laws restricting unfair trade practices, laws relating to trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. The applicability and enforceability of legal principles concerning intellectual property rights in an Internet context remains substantially uncertain as the courts and legislatures in each country in which we operate continue to address the issues. Substantially all of the countries in which we operate are signatories to the same international treaties relating to the protection of intellectual property to which the United States adheres. Nonetheless, in many of these countries, the courts have not had the opportunity to address the legal issues within the Internet context to the same degree as U.S. courts. It is therefore uncertain whether the intellectual property of our non-U.S. operations will be subject to a lesser or different degree of protection than that generally afforded in the United States. 11 The Year 2000 issue could impair our ability to provide services to our customers, increase our costs, or reduce our revenues or profitabilityYear 2000 issues may adversely affect our business and our customers' businesses. Many computer systems may fail or malfunction because they are unable to distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates. We have incurred costs to upgrade our computers to address the year 2000 issue and may in the future incur additional costs. Our customers may also need to incur costs to either upgrade their computers or correct any problems their computers may encounter, which may reduce our revenues by diverting our customers' information systems resources away from our products and services. In addition, if our computer systems or those of our telecommunications suppliers fail or malfunction as a result of Year 2000 issues, our ability to provide services to our customers will be disrupted, which could result in lost revenues, lost customers or claims for damages, which could lead to costly litigation. For information on how we are addressing year 2000 issues, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure." Risks Related to this Offering We have discretion over the use of all of the net proceeds from this offering and may fail to use them effectively to grow our businessWe will retain discretion over how to use the net proceeds of this offering. Because the proceeds are not required to be allocated to any specific investment or transaction, you will not be able to determine at this time the value or appropriateness of our use of the proceeds. You will pay a higher price for our common stock than was paid by existing stockholders and will experience immediate and substantial dilutionIf you purchase common stock in this offering, you will pay more for your shares than the amounts paid by existing stockholders for their shares. As a result, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $14.54 per share, and our existing stockholders will experience an unrealized gain of $195.6 million in the aggregate. 42,068,821, or 73.7%, of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future. These sales could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing wellAfter this offering, we will have outstanding 57,068,821 shares of common stock, based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on January 14, 2000. This amount includes the 15,000,000 shares we are selling in this offering, which may be resold in the public market immediately. The remaining 73.7%, or 42,068,821 shares, of our total outstanding shares will become available for resale in the public market, subject to restrictions under federal securities laws, as shown in the chart below. For information regarding these restrictions, see "Shares Eligible for Future Sale."As restrictions on resale end, the market price could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. &lt;TABLE&gt; &lt;CAPTION&gt; Number of shares/ % of total outstanding Date of availability for resale into public market ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------- &lt;S&gt; &lt;C&gt; 41,613,184/ 180 days after the date of this prospectus due to an 72.9% agreement these stockholders have agreed to deliver to the underwriters. However, the underwriters can waive this restriction and allow these stockholders to sell their shares at any time. 455,637/ Between 90 and 365 days after the date of this 0.8% prospectus due to the requirements of the federal securities laws. &lt;/TABLE&gt; 12In addition, holders of approximately 41,340,721 shares of common stock and non-voting common stock will be entitled to registration rights with respect to their common stock. If these holders exercise their registration rights, causing a large number of shares to be sold in the public market, our market price may drop significantly. Our stock has not traded publicly and may not trade actively after this offeringPrior to this offering, you could not buy or sell our common stock publicly. We cannot assure you that an active public trading market for our stock will develop or be sustained after this offering. The market price of our common stock, like the market prices of stocks of other Internet-related and technology companies, may fluctuate widely and rapidlyThe securities of many companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, often unrelated to the companies' operating performance. Specifically, market prices for securities of Internet-related and technology companies have frequently reached elevated levels following their initial public offerings. These levels may be unsustainable and may not bear any relationship to these companies' operating performances. If the market price of our common stock reaches an elevated level following this offering, it may materially and rapidly decline. Fluctuations in our common stock's market price may affect our visibility and credibility in the Internet services provider marketIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company. If we were to become involved in a class action suit, it could be costly and divert the attention of management. Furthermore, if adversely determined, a class action suit may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The price per share of our common stock in this offering may not be indicative of the market price that will prevail after this offeringSince our stock has not yet traded publicly, our management and the underwriters will negotiate the common stock's initial public offering price per share. The price they determine may not be indicative of the market price that will prevail after this offering. For example, the market price of our common stock after this offering could vary from the initial public offering price in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond our control: . changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts . future announcements concerning us or our competitors of key personnel changes, significant contracts, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, technological innovations or capital commitments . additions or departures of key personnel . quarterly fluctuations in operating results . fluctuations in the stock price and volume of traded shares, especially in the traditionally volatile Internet-related and technology sectors 13</td>

      <td>risk factors an investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. prior to investing in our ordinary shares, we encourage each prospective investor to carefully read this entire prospectus, including, without limitation, the following risk factors and the section of this prospectus entitled cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements. any of the following factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. if any of these risks occur, the value of our ordinary shares could decline, and you could lose all or part of your original investment. risks related to our business the accessories, footwear and apparel industries are heavily influenced by general macroeconomic cycles that affect consumer spending, and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits. purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. the success of our operations depends on a number of factors impacting discretionary consumer spending, including general economic conditions, consumer confidence, wages and unemployment, housing prices, consumer debt, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, taxation and political conditions. a continuation or worsening of the current weakness in the economy may negatively affect consumer and wholesale purchases of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we may not be able to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and operating results. the accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. we believe that our success is largely dependent on our brand image and ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design, styling, production, merchandising and pricing of products. if we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately, consumers may not purchase our products and our brand name and brand image may be impaired. even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brand image to be outdated or associate our brand with styles that are no longer popular or trend-setting. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and operating results.the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within north america and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline. we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign accessories, footwear and apparel producers and retailers, including, among others, coach, burberry, ralph lauren, herms, louis vuitton, gucci, marc jacobs, chlo and prada. competition is based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, the following: anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner; establishing and maintaining favorable brand-name recognition; determining and maintaining product quality; maintaining key employees; 11 maintaining and growing market share; developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers; establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with retail customers; pricing products appropriately; providing appropriate service and support to retailers; optimizing retail and supply chain capabilities; determining size and location of retail and department store selling space; and protecting intellectual property. in addition, some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories, footwear and apparel industries, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products. the general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. competition, along with such other factors as consolidation and changes in consumer spending patterns, could also result in significant pricing pressure. these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers, which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.the departure of our founder, members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. we depend on the services and management experience of our founder and executive officers, who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. in particular, mr.kors, our honorary chairman and chief creative officer, has provided design and executive leadership to the company since its inception. he is instrumental to our marketing and publicity strategy and is closely identified with both the brand that bears his name and our company in general. our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr.kors name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. mr.kors has the right to terminate his employment with us without cause. in addition, the leadership of john d. idol, our chairman and chief executive officer, and joseph b. parsons, our executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief operating officer, has been a critical element of our success. we also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing, design and advertising operations. competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense, and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our executive officers and key employees. although we have entered into employment agreements with mr.kors and certain of our other executive officers, including mr.idol and mr.parsons, we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future. the loss of services of one or more of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to, or relating to, the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to open and operate new retail stores and increase the number of department stores and specialty stores that sell our products. as part of our growth strategy, we intend to open and operate new retail stores and shop-in-shops within select department stores, both domestically and internationally. our ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to: identify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops will be considered successful; negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances, to secure suitable store locations; hire, train and retain personnel and field management; assimilate new personnel and field management into our corporate culture; source sufficient inventory levels; and successfully integrate new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops into our existing operations and information technology systems. we will encounter pre-operating costs and we may encounter initial losses when new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops commence operations. while we expect to open a number of additional retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops in fiscal 2012, there can be no assurance that we will open the planned number, that we will recover the expenditure costs associated with opening these new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops or that the operation of these new venues will be successful or profitable. any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. we face additional risks with respect to our strategy to expand internationally, including our efforts to further expand our operations in european countries and in japan as well as other asian countries. in some of these countries we do not yet have significant operating experience, and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations. many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including, but not limited to, employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate (including lease terms) and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and, as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. in addition, in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we have grown rapidly in recent years and we have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations; if we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our brand image and financial performance may suffer. we have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating experience at our current size. our total revenue increased from $397.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $803.3 million in fiscal 2011. if our operations continue to grow, we will be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarter personnel. our continued growth could strain our existing resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, difficulties in hiring, training and managing an 13 increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products and delays in production and shipments. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.as we expand our store base, we may be unable to maintain the same comparable store sales or average sales per square foot that we have in the past, which could cause our share price to decline. as we expand our store base, we may not be able to maintain the levels of comparable store sales that we have experienced historically. in addition, we may not be able to maintain our historic average sales per square foot as we move into new markets. if our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations, the price of our ordinary shares could decline. in addition, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. a variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot, including, among others, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. if we misjudge the market for our products, we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. these factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods and our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our ordinary shares.we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space under long-term, non-cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases; any failure to make these lease payments when due could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. we do not own any of our store facilities; instead, we lease all of our stores under operating leases. our leases generally have terms of 10 years with no renewal options. our leases generally require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs. for example, as of october 1, 2011, we were party to operating leases associated with our stores as well as other corporate facilities requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating $248.1million through fiscal 2016 and approximately $234.1 million thereafter through fiscal 2028. we expect that we will also lease any new stores we open under operating leases with terms similar to those contained in leases we have entered previously, which will further increase our operating lease expenses. our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including, among others: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; requiring a substantial portion of our available cash to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes; limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and placing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors. we depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us, we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs. our current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control. we have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell, under our trademarks, products requiring specialized expertise. we have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas, including, among others, korea, the philippines, singapore, malaysia, the middle east and turkey. our operations in china, hong kong, macau and taiwan are conducted pursuant to similar licensing agreements that we have entered into with entities that are indirectly owned by certain of our current shareholders, including mr.kors, mr.idol and sportswear holdings limited. see certain relationships and related party transactionsmichael kors far east holdings limited. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners, such arrangements may not be successful. our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the timing of new store openings, the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. in addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partners ability to: obtain capital; exercise operational and financial control over its business; manage its labor relations; maintain relationships with suppliers; manage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and maintain customer relationships. any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands. although we attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over store location and design, product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our stores and products, we may not be able to control the use by our licensing partners of each of our licensed brands. the misuse of our brands by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers, and the loss of any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenue. a small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales. net sales to our five largest wholesale customers were 30.4% of our total revenue for fiscal 2011 and 35.7% of our total revenue for fiscal 2010. our largest wholesale customer, a large, nationally recognized u.s. department store, accounted for 13.8% of our total revenue for fiscal 2011 and 14.5% of our total revenue for fiscal 2010. we do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale customers, and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. a decision by any of our major wholesale customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. during the past several years, the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes, and we expect such changes will continue. in addition, store closings by our wholesale customers decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a 15 smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. in the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores target markets. any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. these changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.a material disruption in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely extensively on our information technology (it) systems to track inventory, manage our supply chain, record and process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. the failure of our it systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or difficulty in integrating new systems could adversely affect our business. in addition, our it systems may be subject to damage and/or interruption from power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and usage errors by our employees. if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim. any significant disruption in our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.direct privacy breaches and the engagement of third parties to operate our e-commerce business could negatively affect our reputation, credibility and business. we are responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce website, michaelkors.com, and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. consumers are increasingly concerned over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. in addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our customers identity and privacy. we do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future. any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers. finally, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information, to the extent they are applicable.increases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer. the costs of raw materials used in our products are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. we are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials, and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials. the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain, but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. if one or more of our distribution facilities becomes inoperable, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. we operate a limited number of distribution facilities. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities. if any of these distribution 16 facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our customers and retail stores. in addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged facility. in addition, we currently operate our california distribution from three separate warehouses totaling approximately 350,000 square feet. the leases for these three facilities expire on march31, 2012. we have executed a lease for an approximately 500,000 square foot distribution center in whittier, california, which we believe will allow us to significantly increase our distribution capabilities and efficiency. we took possession of the new distribution center in october 2011 and intend to complete our transition into this facility prior to the march31, 2012 expiration of the leases for our existing california distribution facilities. as part of this transition, we will implement a new warehouse management system that will supplement our current legacy system and further support our efforts to operate with increased efficiency and flexibility. there are risks inherent in transitioning our existing three distribution facilities into one new facility and in implementing a new warehouse management system, including the risk of late delivery of possession of the new facility, difficulty in negotiating acceptable terms to remain temporarily in the existing facilities in the event of any such late delivery and other operational difficulties that may arise in commencing operations in a new facility with a new management system. any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations. our products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors located mainly in countries in asia, europe and central and south america. a manufacturing contractors failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. the failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any of the following factors could negatively affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results: political or labor instability, labor shortages or increases in costs of labor or production in countries where manufacturing contractors and suppliers are located; political or military conflict involving the united states, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials and increase transportation costs; heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods of time or could result in increased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands; a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials; disease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas; the migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced; imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust in a timely manner to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed; increases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; 17 significant fluctuation of the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies; and restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located. we do not have written agreements with any of our third-party manufacturing contractors. as a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. in fiscal 2011, our largest manufacturing contractor, who primarily produces its products in china and who we have worked with for the last seven years, accounted for the production of 30.5% of our finished products. our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, we use third-party agents to source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf. we do not have written agreements with any of our agents. as a result, any single agent could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. in fiscal 2011, our largest third-party agent, whose primary place of business is hong kong and who we have worked with for the last seven years, sourced approximately 19.5% of our purchases of finished goods. our inability to promptly replace agents that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality service in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.if our manufacturing contractors fail to use acceptable, ethical business practices, our business and reputation could suffer. we require our manufacturing contractors to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those three areas in order to promote ethical business practices, and our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our manufacturing contractors to determine compliance. however, we do not control our manufacturing contractors or their labor and other business practices. if one of our manufacturing contractors violates applicable labor or other laws, rules or regulations or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. we have a $100.0 million
