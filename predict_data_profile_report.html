    <th>risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully read and consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the notes thereto and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, before making an investment decision. if any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects may be adversely affected. as a result, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our businessour operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction in business with our significant customers. we derive a significant amount of revenues from a few customers. for instance, various divisions or business units of one of our customers were responsible for 17.1%, 16.8% and 16.5% of our revenues for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. taken as a group, our top 10 customers were responsible for 35.8%, 35.2% and 38.6% of our revenues for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. generally, our customers do not have an obligation to make purchases from us and may stop ordering our products and services at any time without financial penalty. the loss of any of our significant customers, any substantial decline in sales to these customers or any significant change in the timing or volume of purchases by our customers could result in lower revenues and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.an accident or incident involving our asset protection solutions could expose us to claims, harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to compete for business and, as a result, harm our operating performance. we are exposed to liabilities arising out of the solutions we provide. for instance, we furnish the results of our testing and inspections for use by our customers in their assessment of their assets, facilities, plants and other structures. such results may be incorrect or incomplete, whether as a result of poorly designed inspections, malfunctioning testing equipment or our employees failure to adequately test or properly record data. for example, one of our clients claimed one of our x-ray inspection crews had improperly recorded inspection data about a portion of its infrastructure, requiring us to provide a new team to inspect that infrastructure over a period of three months at our expense. further, if an accident or incident involving a structure we are testing or have tested occurs and causes personal injuries to our personnel or third parties, or property damage, such as the collapse of a bridge or an explosion in a plant or facility, and particularly if these injuries or damages could have been prevented by our customers had we provided them with correct or complete results, we may face significant claims by injured persons or related parties and claims relating to any property damage or loss. even if our results are correct and complete, we may face claims for such injuries or damage simply because we tested the structure or facility in question. for instance, we recently inspected a subset of welds made in a liquid storage tank farm under construction for a customer in order to determine if the welds were being made in accordance with applicable regulations. the welds we tested were specified by the contractor that made them. weeks after our inspections were completed a weld in a tank cracked, resulting in the spill of hazardous material. the 14 customer made a claim on its insurer, which in turn made claims against us, among others, for the clean-up costs, which in this case are not significant. though we believe we did not test the weld that failed, if we are unable to prove this fact we may decide to or be compelled by a court to pay some of the clean-up costs. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the damages from any such claims, forcing us to bear these uninsured damages directly, which could harm our operating results and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenues. an accident or incident for which we are found partially or fully responsible, even if fully insured, may also result in negative publicity, which would harm our reputation among our customers and the public, cause us to lose existing and future contracts or make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, thereby significantly harming our operating performance. such an accident or incident might also make it more expensive or impossible for us to insure against similar events in the future. even unsuccessful claims relating to accidents could result in substantial costs, including litigation expenses, and diversion of our management resources.if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of trained engineers, scientists and other highly-skilled technicians at competitive wages, our operational performance may be harmed and our costs may increase. we believe that our success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of trained engineers, scientists and other highly-skilled, certified technicians at competitive wages. the demand for such employees is currently high, and we project that it may increase substantially in the future. accordingly, we have experienced increases in our labor costs, particularly in our services segment, but also, to a lesser extent, in our international segment. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have comparatively greater name recognition and resources. in addition, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. volatility in the future market price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. furthermore, the requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option awards that job candidates require to join our company. the markets for our products and services also require us to field personnel trained and certified in accordance with standards set by domestic or international standard-setting bodies, such as the american society of non-destructive testing. because of the limited supply of these certified technicians, we expend substantial resources maintaining in-house training and certification programs. if we fail to attract sufficient new personnel or fail to motivate and retain our current personnel, our ability to perform under existing contracts and orders or to pursue new business may be harmed, causing us to lose customers and revenues, and the costs of performing such contracts and orders may increase, which would likely reduce our margins.if we lose members of our senior management team upon whom we are dependent, we may not be able to manage our operations and achieve our strategic objectives. our future success depends to a considerable degree upon the availability, contributions, vision, skills, experience and effort of our senior management team. we do not maintain key person insurance on any of our employees other than dr.sotirios j. vahaviolos, our chairman, president and chief executive officer. we currently have no employment agreements with members of our senior management team other than with dr. vahaviolos. although we may enter into employment agreements with certain executive officers after this offering, these agreements will likely not guarantee the services of the individual for a specified period of time. all of the future agreements with members of our senior management team are expected to provide that 15 their employment is at-will and may be terminated by either us or the employee at any time and without notice. although we do not have any reason to believe that we may lose the services of any of these persons in the foreseeable future, the loss of the services of any of these persons might impede our operations or the achievement of our strategic and financial objectives. the loss or interruption of the service of members of our senior management team could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could significantly reduce our ability to manage our operations and implement our strategy.we operate in highly competitive markets and if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and revenues. we face strong competition from ndt and a variety of niche asset protection providers, both larger and smaller than we are. many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and could focus their substantial financial resources to develop a competing business model or develop products or services that are more attractive to potential customers than what we offer. some of our competitors are business units of companies substantially larger than us and have the ability to combine asset protection solutions into an integrated offering to customers who already purchase other types of products or services from them. our competitors may offer asset protection solutions at prices below or without cost in order to improve their competitive positions. any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, cause us to lower our prices in order to compete and reduce our market share and revenues, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.due to our dependency on customers in the oil and gas industry, we are susceptible to prolonged negative trends relating to this industry that could adversely affect our operating results. our customers in the oil and gas industry (including the petrochemical market) have accounted for a substantial portion of our historical revenues. specifically, they accounted for approximately 58%, 50% and 52% of our revenues for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. we continue to diversify our customer base into industries other than the oil and gas industry, but we may not be successful in doing so. if the oil and gas industry were to suffer a prolonged or significant downturn, our operating performance may be significantly harmed.our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or integrate acquired businesses successfully, which may inhibit our rate of growth, and any acquisitions that we do complete may expose us to a number of unanticipated operational and financial risks. our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, to a certain extent, on our ability to make acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses. we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets globally. we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our current operations or expand into new markets. once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues, profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our current operations, or otherwise perform as expected. 16 some of the risks associated with our acquisition strategy include: unexpected loss of key personnel and customers of the acquired company; making the acquired companys financial and accounting standards consistent with our standards; assumption of liability for risks and exposures (including environmental-related costs), some of which we may not discover during our due diligence;and potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management. our ability to undertake acquisitions is limited by covenants in our credit agreement and our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses, impairment expenses related to goodwill and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. although management intends to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.catastrophic events, such as natural disasters, epidemics, war and acts of terrorism, could disrupt our business or the business of our customers, which could significantly harm our operations, financial results and cash flow. our operations and those of our customers are susceptible to the occurrence of catastrophic events outside our control, ranging from severe weather conditions to acts of war and terrorism. any such events could cause a serious business disruption that reduces our customers ability to or interest in purchasing our asset protection solutions, and have in the past resulted in order cancellations and delays because customer equipment, facilities or operations have been damaged, or are not operational or available. for instance, order cancellations and delays due to hurricane ike adversely affected our revenues in fiscal 2009. additionally, such events have resulted and may in the future result in substantial delays in the provision of solutions to our customers and the loss of valuable equipment. any cancellations, delays or losses due to a catastrophic event may significantly reduce our revenues and harm our operating performance.we face risks related to the current economic downturn. the global economy is currently in a pronounced economic downturn. global financial markets are continuing to experience disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, volatility in interest and currency exchange rates and overall uncertainty about economic stability. there may be further deterioration and volatility in the global economy, the global financial markets and consumer confidence. we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current global economic downturn or disruptions in the financial markets. the downturn has already resulted in some of our customers canceling and delaying orders for our solutions, as well as some customers delaying payment for items billed, which reduced our gross margins and operating income in fiscal 2009. some of our customers have also recently requested price concessions. in addition, current economic conditions have resulted in the reduced creditworthiness, inability to obtain sufficient financing, and bankruptcies of certain 17 customers, increasing our exposure to bad debt. for instance, in fiscal 2009, one of our larger customers filed for bankruptcy due to a downturn in the chemical industry combined with its own highly leveraged position. if economic conditions deteriorate further, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed. although we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations as planned, in light of current market conditions, our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, may harm our financial performance. the inability to obtain adequate financing from debt or capital sources could force us to self-fund strategic initiatives or even forgo certain opportunities, which in turn could potentially harm our performance.we expect to continue expanding and investing in our sales and marketing, operations, engineering, research and development capabilities and financial and reporting systems and, as a result, may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations. we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations. to effectively manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational, financial and reporting systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. we expect that all of these measures will require significant expenditures and will demand the attention of management. we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and adequately train additional qualified personnel. failure to manage our growth effectively could lead us to over or under-invest in technology and operations, result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, the loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new solutions. if our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenues could decline or may grow more slowly than expected and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.the success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to develop new asset protection solutions and increase the functionality of our current offerings. the market for asset protection solutions is impacted by technological change, uncertain product lifecycles, shifts in customer demands and evolving industry standards and regulations. we may not be able to successfully develop and market new asset protection solutions that comply with present or emerging industry regulations and technology standards. also, new regulations or technology standards could increase our cost of doing business. from time to time, our customers have requested greater functionality in our solutions. as part of our strategy to enhance our asset protection solutions and grow our business, we plan to continue making substantial investments in the research and development of new technologies. we believe our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to design new, competitive asset protection solutions, enhance our current solutions and provide new, value-added services. developing new solutions will require continued investment, and we may experience unforeseen technological or operational challenges. in addition, our asset protection software is complex and can be expensive to develop, and new software and software enhancements can require long development and testing periods. if we are unable to develop new asset protection solutions or enhancements to our current offerings, or if the market does not accept 18 such solutions, we will likely lose opportunities to realize revenues and customers and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.if our software produces inaccurate information or is incompatible with the systems used by our customers and makes us unable to successfully provide our solutions, it could lead to a loss of revenues and customers. our software is complex and, accordingly, may contain undetected errors or failures. software defects or inaccurate data may cause incorrect recording, reporting or display of information related to our asset protection solutions. any such failures, defects and inaccurate data may prevent us from successfully providing our asset protection solutions, which would result in lost revenues. software defects or inaccurate data may lead to customer dissatisfaction and our customers may seek to hold us liable for any damages incurred. as a result, we could lose customers, our reputation may be harmed and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. we currently serve a commercial, industrial and governmental customer base that uses a wide variety of constantly changing hardware, software solutions and operating systems. our asset protection solutions need to interface with these non-standard systems in order to gather and assess data. our business depends on the following factors, among others: our ability to integrate our technology with new and existing hardware and software systems; our ability to anticipate and support new standards, especially internet-based standards;and our ability to integrate additional software modules under development with our existing technology and operational processes. if we are unable to adequately address any of these factors, our results of operations and prospects for growth and profitability would be harmed.if we fail to successfully educate current and potential customers regarding the benefits of our asset protection solutions or the market for these solutions otherwise fails to develop, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted. our future success depends on continued and growing commercial acceptance of our asset protection solutions and our ability to obtain additional contracts. we anticipate that revenues related to our asset protection solutions will constitute a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. if we are unable to educate our potential customers about the advantages our solutions have over competing products and services, or our current customers stop purchasing our asset protection solutions, our operating results could be significantly harmed. in addition, because the asset protection solutions industry is rapidly evolving, we could lose insight into trends that may be emerging, which would further harm our competitive position by making it difficult to predict and respond to customer needs. if the market for our asset protection solutions does not continue to develop, our ability to grow our business would be limited and we might not be able to maintain profitability. our results of operations could be harmed if our operating expenses do not correspond with the timing of our revenues. most of our operating expenses, such as employee compensation and property rental expense, are relatively fixed over the short-term. moreover, our spending levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenues. as a result, if revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations, we would not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter without a substantial disruption to our business. this shortfall in revenues could adversely affect our operating results for that quarter and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially.the seasonal nature of our business reduces our revenues in our first and third fiscal quarters. our business is seasonal. our first and third fiscal quarter revenues are typically lower than our revenues in the second and fourth fiscal quarters because demand for our asset protection solutions from the oil and gas as well as the fossil and nuclear power industries increases during their non-peak production periods. for instance, u.s.refineries non-peak periods are generally in our second fiscal quarter, when they are retooling to produce more heating oil for winter, and in our fourth fiscal quarter, when they are retooling to produce more gasoline for summer. as a result of these trends, we generally have reduced cash flows in our second and fourth fiscal quarters, which may require us to borrow under our credit agreement or otherwise, to discontinue planned operations, or to curtail our operations. we expect that the negative impact of seasonality on our first and third fiscal quarter revenues and second and fourth fiscal quarter cash flows will continue.growth in revenues from our services segment or traditional ndt services relative to revenues from our products and systems and international segments, may reduce our overall gross profit margin. our gross profit margin on revenues from our services segment has historically been lower than our gross profit margin on revenues from our other segments because our services have higher labor-related costs. for instance, the gross profit margin in our services segment for fiscal 2009 was 28.9%, while our gross profit margin in our products and systems segment and in our international segment was 49.0% and 43.2%, respectively. our overall gross profit margin was 33.1% during the same period. moreover, our gross profit margin on traditional ndt services has historically been lower than our gross profit margin in our services segment as a whole. as a result, we expect our overall gross profit margin will be lower in periods when revenues from our services, and particularly from traditional ndt services, has increased as a percentage of total revenues and will be higher in periods when revenues from our international or products and systems segments has increased as a percentage of total revenues. fluctuations in our gross profit margin may affect our level of profitability in any period, which may negatively affect the price of our common stock.we have identified two significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. in connection with the audit of our financial results for fiscal 2009, we and our independent registered accounting firm reported to our audit committee two significant deficiencies concerning the substantial number of our internal control processes that are still being formalized or are manual in nature and the design of certain controls related to the financial statement closing process. these processes, at times, require significant effort to execute and, therefore, 20 generally may not provide a sustainable platform for an effective and efficient financial statement closing process. a significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the registrants financial reporting. if we are unable to remedy these significant deficiencies, or if we discover other significant deficiencies in the future, then we may not be able to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on our business or operating results.our business is currently subject to governmental regulation, and may become subject to modified or new government regulation that may negatively impact our ability to market our asset protection solutions. we incur substantial costs in complying with various government regulations and licensing requirements. for example, the transportation and overnight storage of radioactive materials used in providing certain of our asset protection solutions is subject to regulation under federal and state laws and licensing requirements. our services segment is currently licensed to handle radioactive materials by the u.s.nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) and 18state regulatory agencies. if we allegedly fail to comply with these regulations, we may be investigated and incur significant legal expenses associated with such investigations, and if we are found to have violated these regulations, we may be fined or lose one or more of our licenses to perform further projects. while we are investigated, we may be required to suspend work on the projects associated with our alleged noncompliance, resulting in loss of profits or customers, and damage to our reputation. for instance, in january, 2007, we were investigated due to an incident involving radiation exposure resulting from the misconduct of one of our employees. as a result, our customer required us to briefly suspend work on the associated project. we were found to have violated regulations governing the handling of radioactive materials, and as a result we incurred significant legal expenses. a more serious violation could result in lost profits and damage to our reputation. many of our customers have strict requirements concerning safety or loss time occurrences. in the future, federal, state, provincial or local governmental agencies may seek to change current regulations or impose additional regulations on our business. any modified or new government regulation applicable to our current or future asset protection solutions may negatively impact the marketing and provision of those solutions and increase our costs and the price of our solutions.a significant stockholder controls the direction of our business. the concentrated ownership of our common stock may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. dr.sotirios j. vahaviolos, our chairman, president and chief executive officer, will own approximately 43% of our outstanding common stock after this offering. as a result, dr.vahaviolos will have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation, and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. this concentration of ownership could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with differing interests from dr.vahaviolos. an inability to protect our intellectual property could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our ability to compete effectively depends in part upon the maintenance and protection of the intellectual property related to our asset protection solutions. patent protection is unavailable for certain aspects of the technology and operational processes important to our business. any patent held by us or to be issued to us, or any of our pending patent applications, could be unenforceable, challenged, invalidated or circumvented. some of our trademarks that are not in use may become available to others. to date, we have relied principally on copyright, trademark and trade secrecy laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property. however, we have not obtained confidentiality agreements from all of our customers and vendors, and although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with all of our employees in our products and systems segment and certain of our other employees involved in the development of our intellectual property, we cannot be certain that these agreements will be honored or enforceable. some of our confidentiality agreements are not in writing, and some customers are subject to laws and regulations that require them to disclose information that we would otherwise seek to keep confidential. although we do not transfer ownership of some of our more advanced asset protection products and systems and, instead, sell to our customers services using these products and systems, in part, in an effort to protect the intellectual property upon which they are based, this strategy may not be successful and our customers or third parties may reverse engineer or otherwise derive this intellectual property and use it without our authorization. policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive. the steps that we have taken or may take might not prevent misappropriation of the intellectual property on which we rely. in addition, effective protection may be unavailable or limited in jurisdictions outside the united states, as the intellectual property laws of foreign countries sometimes offer less protection or have onerous filing requirements. from time to time, third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights. litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. any litigation could be unsuccessful, cause us to incur substantial costs, divert resources away from our daily operations and result in the impairment of our intellectual property. failure to adequately enforce our rights could cause us to lose valuable rights in our intellectual property and may negatively affect our business.we may be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation related to allegations that our asset protection solutions infringe on the intellectual property of others, which could prevent us from offering those solutions. third-party patent applications and patents may</th>

    <th>RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment BECAUSE WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AS A SOFTWARE COMPANY, OUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS UNCERTAIN Although FirePond was incorporated in 1983, we have only been focused on providing software products since 1997. Because we have only been focused on providing software products for a short time, we have a limited operating history pursuing this business model. The revenue and income potential of the market for e-business sales and marketing solutions is unproven. As a result, our historical financial statements are not an accurate indicator of our future operating results. In addition, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business, and we cannot forecast operating expenses based on our historical results. In evaluating FirePond, you should consider the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. If we are not able to successfully address these risks, our business could be harmedWE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES AND MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE We have incurred quarterly and annual losses intermittently since we were formed in 1983, and regularly since we undertook our strategic restructuring in late 1996. We incurred net losses of $27.0 million for fiscal 1997, $9.0 million for fiscal 1998 and $28.9 million for fiscal 1999. We expect to continue to incur losses on both a quarterly and annual basis and we are uncertain if or when we will become profitable. Moreover, we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing and research and development expenses, and, as a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not sustain our growth or generate sufficient revenues to attain profitabilityDISAPPOINTING QUARTERLY REVENUES OR OPERATING RESULTS COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO FALL We currently derive a significant portion of our license revenues in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders, and we generally recognize revenues from our licenses over the related implementation period. If we are unable to recognize revenues from one or more substantial license sales planned for a particular fiscal quarter, our operating results for that quarter would be seriously harmed. In addition, the purchase of our products typically involves a substantial commitment of resources by our customers or their consultants over an extended period of time. The time required to complete an implementation may vary from customer to customer and may be protracted due to unforeseen circumstances. Because our revenues from implementation, maintenance and training services are largely correlated with our license revenues, a decline in license revenues would also cause a decline in our services revenues in the same quarter and in subsequent quarters. Because our sales cycle is long, we may have difficulty predicting when we will recognize revenues. If our quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantiallyA SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS PERFORMED BY A THIRD PARTY INTERNATIONALLY, THE LOSS OF WHICH WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY HARM OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS A significant percentage of our product development work, and some of our implementation services, are performed by a third-party development organization in Minsk, Belarus. Unpredictable developments in the political, economic and social conditions in Belarus, or our failure to renew our consulting agreement with this organization on terms similar to our current agreement, could eliminate or reduce the availability of these product development and implementation services. If access to these services were to be unexpectedly eliminated or significantly reduced, our ability to meet development objectives vital to our ongoing strategy would be hindered, and our business could be seriously harmed. 4 9 THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON THE NEW FIREPOND APPLICATION SUITE, WHICH HAS BEEN RECENTLY INTRODUCED AND MAY NOT BE WIDELY ADOPTED BY OUR CUSTOMERS We expect to derive substantially all of our product license revenues in the future from the newly announced FirePond Application Suite and its component products, which were released in October 1999. Our business depends on the successful release, introduction and customer acceptance of this new suite of products. We expect that we will continue to depend on revenues from new and enhanced versions of the FirePond Application Suite, and our business would be harmed if our target customers do not adopt and expand their use of the FirePond Application Suite and its component productsOUR CUSTOM DEVELOPMENT SERVICES REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES, AND THE UNEXPECTED LOSS OF A CONTRACT COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES Custom development services revenues represented 99% of total revenues for fiscal 1997, 76% of total revenues for fiscal 1998 and 46% of total revenues for fiscal 1999. While we anticipate that custom development services revenues will decline as a percentage of total revenues as license revenues increase, we expect that it will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues. We also expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of these revenues. For example, for fiscal 1999, custom development services revenues from two customers accounted for 27% of our total revenues in the aggregate. An unexpected decrease in revenues from our custom development services and related maintenance contracts could adversely affect our overall revenues and our operating resultsFAILURE TO INCREASE OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS International revenues currently account for a significant percentage of our total revenues. We expect international revenues to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues in the future and we believe that we must continue to expand our international sales activities to be successfulHowever, foreign markets for our products may develop more slowly than currently anticipated. International revenues represented 11% in fiscal 1999. Our failure to expand our international sales could have a significant negative impact on our business FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED ORGANIZATION COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS If we fail to manage our geographically dispersed organization, we may fail to meet or exceed our objectives and our revenues may decline. We perform research and development activities in Minnesota, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Belarus, and our executive officers and other key employees are similarly dispersed throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. This geographic dispersion requires significant management resources that our locally-based competitors do not need to devote to their operations. In addition, the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resourcesINTEGRATION OF A NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM AND NEW PERSONNEL AND CONTINUED RAPID GROWTH MAY STRAIN OUR OPERATIONS We have recently experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion. All members of our senior management team have joined FirePond since May 1997. From July 1997 to December 1998, significant turnover of our employees occurred in conjunction with our change in focus from providing custom development services to providing packaged software products. A significant increase in domestic and international personnel will likely be necessary to address potential growth in our customer base and market opportunities. This may place a significant burden on our management and our internal resources. If we are not able to install adequate systems, procedures and controls to support our future operations in an efficient and timely manner, or if we are unable to otherwise manage growth effectively, our business could be harmed. 5 10 INTENSE COMPETITION FROM OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES COULD PREVENT US FROM INCREASING OR SUSTAINING REVENUES AND PREVENT US FROM ACHIEVING OR SUSTAINING PROFITABILITY The market for integrated e-business sales and marketing solutions is intensely competitive and we expect that this competition will increase. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater resources than we do. Therefore, they may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. If we are unable to compete effectively, our revenues could significantly declineFAILURE TO EXPAND OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS AND CONSULTING FIRMS WOULD IMPEDE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND DELAY THE GROWTH OF OUR REVENUES At times we rely on systems integrators and consulting firms to recommend our products to their customers and to install and support our products for their customers. To increase our revenues and implementation capabilities, we must develop and expand our relationships with systems integrators and consulting firms. If these firms fail to implement our products successfully for their clients, we may not have the resources to implement our products on the schedule required by the client which would result in our inability to recognize revenues from the license of our products to these customersIF e-BUSINESS SALES AND MARKETING SOLUTIONS ARE NOT WIDELY ADOPTED, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL Our products address a new and emerging market for e-business sales and marketing solutions. The failure of this market to develop, or a delay in the development of this market, would seriously harm our business. The success of e-business sales and marketing solutions depends substantially upon the widespread adoption of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce and business applications. The Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by the continued growth upon which our success dependsMoreover, critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet, such as security, reliability, cost, accessibility and quality of service, remain unresolved and may negatively affect the growth of Internet use or the attractiveness of commerce and business communication over the Internet IF WE ARE UNABLE TO INTRODUCE NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS THAT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, OUR REVENUES MAY DECLINE Our market is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Advances in Internet technology or in e-commerce software applications, or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing software, could lead to new competitive products that have better performance or lower prices than our products and could render our products obsolete and unmarketable. In addition, if a new software language or operating system becomes standard or is widely adopted in our industry, we may need to rewrite portions of our products in another computer language or for another operating system to remain competitive. If we are unable to develop new and enhanced products on a timely basis that respond to changing technology, our business could be seriously harmedWE DEPEND ON TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO US BY THIRD PARTIES, THE LOSS OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION We license technology from a small number of software providers for use with our products. In addition, the effective implementation of our products depends upon the successful operation of third-party licensed technology in conjunction with our products. We anticipate that we will continue to license and rely on technology from third parties in the future. This technology may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and some of the technology we license would be difficult to replace. The loss of the use of this technology would result in delays in the license and implementation of our products until equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated. In turn, this could prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products, delay new product introductions, or injure our reputation. 6 11 WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL AND MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO BE SUCCESSFUL Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior sales, engineering and management personnel, who perform important functions, and would be difficult to replace. Specifically, we believe that our future success is highly dependent on Klaus P. Besier, our chairman, president and chief executive officer, and other senior management personnel. The loss of the services of any key personnel, particularly senior management and engineers, could seriously harm our business. In addition, our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled employees, particularly marketing personnel, software engineers and other senior personnel. Our failure to attract and retain the highly-trained technical personnel that are integral to our product development, professional services and support teams may limit our ability to develop new products or product enhancementsCLAIMS MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST US IF WE HIRE FORMER EMPLOYEES OF OUR COMPETITORS, WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS Companies in the software industry, whose employees accept positions with competitors, frequently claim that those competitors have breached, or encouraged the breach of, noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements. These claims have been made against us in the past, and we may receive claims in the future as we hire additional qualified personnel. If a claim were to be made against us, it could result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against any of these claims, regardless of the merits of these claimsIF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROFESSIONAL SERVICE AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT, OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OR GROW OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED Our ability to continue to grow, to retain current and future customers and to recognize revenues from our licenses depends in part upon the quality of our professional service and customer support operations. Failure to offer adequate integration, consulting and other professional services in connection with the implementation of our products, and ongoing customer support, either directly or through third parties, could materially and adversely affect our operating results and reputation, and could cause demand for our products to declineIF OUR NEW AND COMPLEX PRODUCTS FAIL TO PERFORM PROPERLY, OUR REVENUES WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED Software products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors, or bugs, which result in product failures, or may cause our products to fail to meet our customers' expectations. Our products may be particularly susceptible to bugs or performance degradation because of the evolving nature of Internet technologies and the stress that full deployment of our products over the Internet to thousands of end-users may cause. Because we have only recently released our primary product, the FirePond Application Suite, it may be particularly susceptible to bugs. Product performance problems could result in loss of or delay in revenues, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of development resources or injury to our reputationPRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR CUSTOMERS' CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS Our products are critical to the business operations of our customers. If one of our products fails, a customer may assert a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for the failure. Our product liability insurance may not cover claims brought against us. Product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. Any product liability claims, whether or not successful, could seriously damage our reputation and our business. 7 12 IF WE OR OUR KEY SUPPLIERS OR CUSTOMERS FAIL TO BE YEAR 2000 COMPLIANT, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE SEVERELY DISRUPTED AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE HARMED The year 2000 problem creates a risk for us. The risk exists primarily in four areas: - potential warranty or other claims from our customers, which may result in significant expense to us; - failures of systems we use to run our business, which could disrupt our business operations; - potential failures of our products, particularly our central office-based systems, which may require that we incur significant unexpected expenses; and - the possibility that our potential customers will reduce spending on e-business software products such as ours as a result of significant spending on year 2000 remediation. Our products are generally integrated into computer systems involving sophisticated hardware and complex software products, which may not be year 2000 compliant. The failure of our customers' systems to be year 2000 compliant could limit our ability to remedy known defects in our products. Therefore, known or unknown defects that affect the operation of our software, could result in delay or loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation, or increased service or warranty costs and litigation costs, any of which could harm our businessOUR LIMITED ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary technology. Any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenuesExisting patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States Therefore, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult. Some of our contractual arrangements provide third parties with access to our source code and other intellectual property upon the occurrence of specified events. This access could enable these third parties to use our intellectual property and source code to develop and manufacture competing products, which would adversely affect our performance and ability to compete. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could materially adversely affect our future operating resultsCLAIMS ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF A THIRD PARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE TO US AND RESULT IN OUR LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT RIGHTS The software and other Internet-related industries are characterized by the existence of frequent litigation of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our businessAny claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product shipment delays, disrupt our relationships with our customers or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If a claim against us is successful and we cannot obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms, license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affectedDIFFICULTIES AND FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS We may consider acquiring complementary businesses and technologies in the future. If we make an acquisition, we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders' percentage 8 13 ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, incur a one-time charge or be required to amortize goodwill. Additionally, we may not be able to successfully integrate any technologies, products, personnel or operations of companies that we may acquire in the future. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, and increase our expenses. If we are unable to successfully address any of these risks, our business could be seriously harmedCONTROL BY OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND THEIR AFFILIATES MAY LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF DIRECTOR ELECTIONS AND OTHER MATTERS REQUIRING STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL Upon completion of this offering, our executive officers, directors and their affiliates will own 16,739,150 shares, or approximately 51% of the outstanding shares of common stock, 50% if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. These stockholders can control substantially all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or discouraging a potential acquiror from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stockOUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE WHICH MAY LEAD TO LOSSES BY INVESTORS AND RESULT IN SECURITIES LITIGATION There has previously not been a public market for our common stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest will lead to the development of a trading market for our common stock or how liquid that market might become. The initial public offering price for the shares was determined by negotiations between us and the representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the stock market in general, the Nasdaq National Market, and securities of Internet and software companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. The trading prices of many Internet and software companies' stocks are at or near historical highs and these trading prices are substantially above historical levels. These trading prices may not be sustained. These broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against publicly traded companiesLitigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations FUTURE SALES OF OUR STOCK COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO FALL Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market after this offering could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securitiesPROVISIONS OF DELAWARE LAW AND OF OUR CHARTER AND BY-LAWS MAY MAKE A TAKEOVER MORE DIFFICULT AND LOWER THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and in Delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so, and the ability of public stockholders to change our management could be substantially impeded by these anti-takeover provisions. For example, we have a staggered board of directors and the right under our charter documents to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval, which could adversely affect the holders of our common stock. 9</th>

    <th>risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the following factors and the other information in this prospectus before deciding to purchase any shares of our common stock. risks relating to our dividend policy you may not receive any dividends, and the reduction or elimination of dividends would negatively affect the market price of our common stock. while our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy, effective upon the closing of this offering, we are not obligated to pay dividends on our common stock. dividend payments are within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. for example, we might not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, or we might suffer an uninsured loss of a satellite requiring significant and unplanned capital expenditures, resulting in an inability to pay dividends on our common stock in the intended amounts or at all. in addition, we are subject to certain restrictions on payment of dividends under panamsat's senior secured credit facilities or the indentures governing the issuer's senior discount notes and panamsat's 9% senior notes which, if triggered, may result in our modification or elimination of dividends. additionally, our need for cash to fund capital expenditures and new growth opportunities may increase. under those circumstances, our board of directors may decide to use cash from operations for increased capital expenditures or to take advantage of new growth opportunities. any reduction or elimination of dividends would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.our dividend policy may limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities. our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy, effective upon the closing of this offering, which reflects an intention to distribute a substantial portion of the cash generated by our business in excess of operating expenses and working capital requirements, interest and principal payments on our indebtedness and capital expenditures as regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. in developing this policy, we have made assumptions for and judgments about the first four full fiscal quarters following the closing of this offering as to our expected results of operations, anticipated levels of capital expenditures, cash interest expense, income taxes and working capital, and the continued availability of borrowings under panamsat's revolving credit facility. as a result of the dividend policy, our ability to finance any material expansion of our business or to fund our operations may be more limited than if we had retained all of our cash flow from operations. in addition, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business, including through acquisitions or increased capital spending, will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing. we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us at an acceptable cost, or at all. see "dividend policy and restrictions". risks relating to our businesswe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, comply with our debt covenants, repay our indebtedness and operate our business. as of december31, 2004, on a pro forma basis and after giving effect to the offering, we would have had outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3,244.6million, which would have represented approximately 75% of our total consolidated capitalization. panamsat currently has availability of $207.0million (net of standby letters of credit of approximately $43.0million) under its revolving credit facility. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. for example, it could: make it more difficult for the issuer to pay dividends on its common stock; make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt, and a failure to comply with any financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under our debt instruments and agreements; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on the issuer's common stock, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy, or other purposes; and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt. any of the above listed factors could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. furthermore, our interest expense could increase if interest rates rise because the entire amount of our debt under panamsat's senior secured credit facilities bears interest at floating rates. see "description of indebtednesssenior secured credit facilities". if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt, we would need to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell securities, none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all.we are a holding company with no operations, and unless we receive dividends, distributions, advances, transfers of funds or other payments from our subsidiaries, we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock and meet our debt service and other obligations. we are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. we do not have, apart from our ownership of panamsat, any independent operations. as a result, we will rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from panamsat and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock and meet our debt service and other obligations. the ability of panamsat and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us will depend on panamsat's operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the covenants contained in panamsat's senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing panamsat's 9%senior notes, and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. in addition, because we are a holding company, your claims as stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of our subsidiaries, including obligations under panamsat's senior secured credit facilities and 9%senior notes. therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our subsidiaries will be able to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and our subsidiaries' liabilities and obligations have been paid in full. despite our current leverage, we may still be able to incur significant additional indebtedness. this could further exacerbate the risks that we face. we will be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. although the indenture governing the senior discount notes and instruments governing panamsat's indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. if new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face, including those described above, could intensify.the terms of panamsat's senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the issuer's senior discount notes and panamsat's 9% senior notes may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions. panamsat's senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the issuer's senior discount notes and panamsat's 9% senior notes contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. panamsat's senior secured credit facilities include financial covenants, including requirements that it: maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio; and not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio. the financial covenants contained in panamsat's senior secured credit facilities will become more restrictive over time. in addition, panamsat's senior secured credit facilities limit panamsat's ability to make capital expenditures and require that it use proceeds of certain asset sales that are not reinvested in panamsat's business to repay indebtedness under them. panamsat's senior secured credit facilities also include covenants restricting, among other things, its ability to: incur or guarantee additional debt or issue preferred stock; pay dividends, or make redemptions and repurchases, with respect to capital stock; create or incur certain liens; make certain loans, acquisitions, capital expenditures or investments; and engage in mergers, acquisitions, asset sales and sale and lease-back transactions. the indenture relating to the issuer's senior discount notes and the indenture relating to panamsat's 9% senior notes also contain numerous covenants including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue disqualified or preferred stock; create liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; pay dividends or make other equity distributions; repurchase or redeem capital stock; make investments or other restricted payments; sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies; create limitations on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or distributions to us; and engage in transactions with affiliates. the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in panamsat's senior secured credit facilities could result in a default under such facilities. if any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, enforce their security interest or require panamsat to apply all of its available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would result in an event of default under the issuer's senior discount notes and panamsat's senior notes. those lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt owed to them. if the debt under the senior secured credit facilities were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full or to repay the issuer's senior discount notes and panamsat's 9% senior notes and our other debt. see "description of indebtedness".our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to suffer a loss that is not adequately covered by insurance. our current satellite insurance does not protect us against all satellite-related losses that we may experience, and we do not have in-orbit insurance coverage for all of the satellites in our fleet. some of our insured satellites are covered by policies with significant exclusions or exceptions to coverage for failures of specific components identified by the underwriters as at risk for possible failure ("significant exclusion policies") and deductibles related to specific components identified by the insurers as the most likely to fail or by a policy with a lower coverage amount than the carrying value of its insurable costs. moreover, any claims under existing policies are subject to settlement with the insurers. as of december31, 2004, we had in effect launch and in-orbit policies covering seven satellites in the aggregate amount of approximately $690.1million, three of which were covered by significant exclusion policies. as our insurance policies expire, we may elect to reduce or eliminate insurance coverage relating to certain of our satellites to the extent permitted by our debt agreements if, in our view, exclusions make such policies ineffective or the costs of coverage make such insurance impractical and if we believe that we can more reasonably protect our business through the use of in-orbit spare satellites, backup transponders and self-insurance. seventeen of our satellites are currently uninsured. as of december31, 2004, our uninsured satellites and the satellites covered by significant exclusion policies had a total net book value of satellites and other insurable costs of approximately $971.7million. an additional risk to our business is that we do not generally obtain insurance to cover the risk of revenues lost as a result of satellite anomalies. as a result, even if insurance were to cover a loss relating to a launch or in-orbit failure, we would not be adequately compensated for lost revenues attributable to that loss. as of december31, 2004, the total net book value of satellites and other insurable costs, which includes certain sales-type leases plus the estimated amount of warranty liabilities related to transponders sold outright, less incentive obligations, totaled approximately $1,527.2million. in january 2005, our galaxy5 satellite was replaced by our galaxy12 satellite and was deorbited and the insurance policy for our galaxy10r satellite expired and was not renewed. the net book value and other insurable costs of our galaxy5 and galaxy10r satellites were $0 and approximately $98million as of december31, 2004, respectively. a partial or complete failure of a revenue-producing satellite, whether insured or not, could require additional, unplanned capital expenditures, an acceleration of planned capital expenditures, interruptions in service, a reduction in contracted backlog and lost revenue, and could limit our ability to pay dividends.our business is capital intensive, and we may not be able to access the capital markets when we would like to raise capital. we may not be able to raise adequate capital to complete some or all of our business strategies or to react rapidly to changes in technology, products, services or the competitive landscape. industry participants often face high capital requirements in order to take advantage of new market opportunities, respond to rigorous competitive pressures and react quickly to changes in technology. many of our competitors are committing substantial capital and, in many instances, are forming alliances to acquire or maintain market leadership. our business is capital intensive and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future.we are subject to significant and intensifying competition both within the fss industry and outside the industry from companies offering other means to transmit signals, such as through fiber optics. we face significant and intensifying competition in the fss industry in different regions around the world from companies such as: intelsatltd. and eutelsat s.a.; ses global, the entity formed by the november2001 acquisition of ge american communications,inc. by societe europeenne des satellites, the luxembourg-based operator of astra, one of europe's leading dth services; new skies satellites n.v.; and loral space& communicationsltd. among others. competition in the fss industry lowers prices, which can reduce our operating margins and the cash available to fund our operations, service our debt obligations and pay dividends. there has been a trend toward consolidation of major fss providers as customers increasingly demand more robust distribution platforms with network redundancies and worldwide reach, and we expect to face increased competition as a result of this trend. for example, ses global now has the world's largest satellite fleet, and the combined entity is now capable of providing service in many of the markets we serve. these and other direct competitors are likely to continue developing and launching satellites with greater power and more transponders, which may create satellite capacity at lower costs. in order to compete effectively, we may have to invest in similar technology. in addition, we believe that there are many companies that are seeking ways to improve the ability of existing land-based infrastructure, such as fiber optic cable, to transmit signals. any significant improvement or increase in the amount of land-based capacity, particularly with respect to the existing fiber optic cable infrastructure and point-to-point applications, may cause our video services customers to shift their transmissions to land-based capacity or make it more difficult for us to obtain new customers. if fiber optic cable networks or other ground-based high-capacity transmission systems are available to service a particular point, that capacity, when available, is generally less expensive than satellite capacity. as land-based telecommunications services expand, demand for some satellite-based services may be reduced. some of our direct and indirect competitors, both those in and outside of the fss industry, have greater financial resources and operating flexibility than we do. this may permit them to respond better to changes in the industry.we could be adversely affected if our customers default on their obligations to us. we rely on a limited number of customers to provide a substantial portion of our revenues and contracted backlog. for example, two customers, the directv group and the news corporation, comprised approximately 15% and 11%, respectively, of total revenues in 2004. no other customers represent more than 10% of revenues. some customers have in the past defaulted and, although we monitor our larger customers' financial performance and seek deposits, guarantees and other methods of protection against default where possible, our customers may in the future default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsmanagement overview". defaults by any of our larger customers or by a group of smaller customers who, collectively, represent a significant portion of our revenues could adversely affect our revenues, operating margins and cash flows.we are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. a significant portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states. for the years ended december31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, approximately 58%, 56% and 56% of our revenues, respectively, were generated from customers outside of the united states. accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. these risks include, but are not limited to: required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including telecommunications standards, noncompliance with which could restrict our ability to compete in certain foreign markets; withholding taxes or other taxes of our foreign income imposed by foreign countries, which could make the cost of our services in such markets prohibitively expensive or reduce cash flows; tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements imposed by foreign countries, which could limit our ability to compete in such markets; fluctuations in exchange rates that may affect the demand for our services and adversely affect the profitability in u.s. dollars of services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our services is made in the local currency; difficulty in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems, which could limit our ability to receive payments for services rendered; and changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, which could limit our ability to provide services, compete or receive payments for services rendered. our business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other regulatory, economic, social and political risks inherent in international business.our strategy to selectively pursue complementary acquisitions may present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs. we may selectively pursue complementary acquisitions and joint ventures. acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; difficulty with integration of personnel and financial and other systems; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. in addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in the integration of acquired businesses. also, the presence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired company that are unknown to us at the time of acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our business. our acquisition and joint venture strategy may not be successfully received by customers, and we may not realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures.we are a "controlled company" within the meaning established by the new york stock exchange and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. under the stockholders agreement among our sponsors, each of the sponsors is permitted to designate a certain number of directors to our board of directors, and the other sponsors are obligated to vote in favor of those designees. as a result, and because collectively, our sponsors will continue to beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock following this offering, we will be considered a "controlled company" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the new york stock exchange. under these rules, a "controlled company" may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including (1)the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (2)the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (3)the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. following this offering, we intend to utilize these exemptions. as a result, we will not have a majority of independent directors nor will we have compensation and nominating/corporate governance committees consisting entirely of independent directors. accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange.our sponsors may have significant influence on our company, including control over decisions that require the approval of equityholders, whether or not such decision is believed by the other equityholders to be in their own best interests. after the consummation of this offering, our sponsors will beneficially own approximately 58% of our common stock, or approximately 55% of our common stock if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares. as a result, our sponsors will have the collective ability to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the nomination and election of directors, the determination of our corporate and management policies and the determination, without the consent of our other stockholders, of the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. so long as our sponsors continue to own a majority of our outstanding common stock, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. risks relating to our industryonce launched and properly deployed, satellites are subject to significant operational risks due to various types of potential anomalies. satellites utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and, accordingly, are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. these risks include malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, that have occurred in our satellites and the satellites of other operators as a result of: the satellite manufacturer's error, whether due to the use of new and largely unproven technology or simply due to a manufacturing defect; problems with the power systems of the satellites, including: circuit failures causing reductions in the power output of the solar arrays on the satellites, which could require us to forego the use of some transponders initially and to turn off additional transponders in later years; and/or failure of the cells within the batteries, whose sole purpose is to power the payload and spacecraft operations during the daily eclipse periods which occur for brief periods of time during two 40-day periods around march21 and september21 of each year; problems with the control systems of the satellites, including: failure of the primary and/or backup spacecraft control processor, or scp; failure of the xenon-ion propulsion systems, or xips, used on certain boeing satellites, which is an electronic propulsion system that maintains the spacecraft's proper in-orbit position; and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh space environment. we have experienced anomalies in each of the categories described above. although we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of these anomalies in new satellites and provide for on-satellite backups for certain critical components to minimize or eliminate service disruptions in the event of failure, we may experience anomalies in the future, whether of the types described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components, and an on-satellite backup may not be available upon the occurrence of such an anomaly. in particular, we may experience additional anomalies relating to the failure of the scp in certain of our boeing model 601, or bss 601, satellites (not including our bss 601 hp satellites), various anomalies associated with xips in our bss 601 hp satellites or a progressive degradation of the solar arrays in certain of our boeing model 702, or bss 702, satellites. two bss 601 satellites that we operated in the past, as well as bss 601 satellites operated by others, have experienced a failure of the primary and backup scps. two of the bss 601 satellites that we currently operate have experienced a failure of the primary scp. certain of the bss 601 hp satellites have experienced various problems associated with their xips. we operate seven satellites of this type. three of our currently operated bss 601 hp satellites have experienced failures of both xips. we may in the future experience similar problems associated with xips or other propulsion systems on our satellites. based on a review of available data, we recently reduced our estimate of the useful life of one of our bss601hp satellites, pas-9. two of the three bss 702 satellites that we operate, as well as bss 702s of a similar design operated by others, have experienced a progressive degradation of their solar arrays causing a reduction in output power. along with the manufacturer, we continually monitor the problem to determine its cause and its expected effect. the power reduction may require us to permanently turn off certain transponders on the affected satellites to allow for the continued operation of other transponders, which could result in a loss of revenues, or may result in a reduction of the satellite's useful life. due to this continued degradation, based on a review of available data, we recently reduced our estimate of the useful lives of both satellites. on march17, 2004, our pas-6 satellite suffered an anomaly resulting in a loss of power. on april1, 2004, this satellite experienced another and more significant loss of power. following that event, we commenced deorbiting the satellite. as a result of the march17 event, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $99.9million within income from operations in the first quarter of 2004. this resulted in an approximate $63.3million after-tax non-cash charge to net loss. pas-6 had been previously replaced and, at the time of the anomaly, was being used as a backup for another satellite. on august3, 2004, the secondary xips on our galaxy 10r satellite permanently failed. the primary xips on this satellite had previously failed. in the absence of the primary and secondary xips, this satellite is expected to operate normally on its available backup fuel system for over three years. prior to this event, galaxy 10r was scheduled to have an estimated end of useful life in 2015. as a result, we anticipate an additional depreciation expense of approximately $3million per year. any single anomaly or series of anomalies could materially and adversely affect our operations, our revenues, our relationship with our current customers and our ability to attract new customers for our satellite services. in particular, future anomalies may result in the loss of individual transponders on a satellite, a group of transponders on that satellite or the entire satellite, depending on the nature of the anomaly and the availability of on-satellite backups. anomalies and our estimate of their future effect may also cause a reduction of the expected useful life of a satellite and contracted backlog. anomalies may also cause a reduction of the revenues generated by that satellite or the recognition of an impairment loss. finally, the occurrence of anomalies may adversely affect our ability to insure our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all. while some anomalies are covered by insurance policies, others are not or may not be covered. see "risks relating to our businessour financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to suffer a loss that is not adequately covered by insurance".new satellites are subject to launch failures, the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations. satellites are subject to certain risks related to failed launches. of the 38 satellites launched by us or our predecessors since 1983, three have resulted in launch failures. in addition, certain launch vehicles that we have used or are scheduled to use have experienced launch failures in the past. launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites, which can take 24months or longer, and to obtain other launch opportunities. such significant delays could materially and adversely affect our operations and our revenues. launch vehicles may also underperform, in which case the satellite may still be placed into service by using its onboard propulsion systems to reach the desired orbital location, resulting in a reduction in its useful life. in addition, although we have had launch insurance on all of our launches to date, if we were not able to obtain launch insurance on

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully read and consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the notes thereto and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, before making an investment decision. if any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects may be adversely affected. as a result, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our businessour operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction in business with our significant customers. we derive a significant amount of revenues from a few customers. for instance, various divisions or business units of one of our customers were responsible for 17.1%, 16.8% and 16.5% of our revenues for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. taken as a group, our top 10 customers were responsible for 35.8%, 35.2% and 38.6% of our revenues for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. generally, our customers do not have an obligation to make purchases from us and may stop ordering our products and services at any time without financial penalty. the loss of any of our significant customers, any substantial decline in sales to these customers or any significant change in the timing or volume of purchases by our customers could result in lower revenues and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.an accident or incident involving our asset protection solutions could expose us to claims, harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to compete for business and, as a result, harm our operating performance. we are exposed to liabilities arising out of the solutions we provide. for instance, we furnish the results of our testing and inspections for use by our customers in their assessment of their assets, facilities, plants and other structures. such results may be incorrect or incomplete, whether as a result of poorly designed inspections, malfunctioning testing equipment or our employees failure to adequately test or properly record data. for example, one of our clients claimed one of our x-ray inspection crews had improperly recorded inspection data about a portion of its infrastructure, requiring us to provide a new team to inspect that infrastructure over a period of three months at our expense. further, if an accident or incident involving a structure we are testing or have tested occurs and causes personal injuries to our personnel or third parties, or property damage, such as the collapse of a bridge or an explosion in a plant or facility, and particularly if these injuries or damages could have been prevented by our customers had we provided them with correct or complete results, we may face significant claims by injured persons or related parties and claims relating to any property damage or loss. even if our results are correct and complete, we may face claims for such injuries or damage simply because we tested the structure or facility in question. for instance, we recently inspected a subset of welds made in a liquid storage tank farm under construction for a customer in order to determine if the welds were being made in accordance with applicable regulations. the welds we tested were specified by the contractor that made them. weeks after our inspections were completed a weld in a tank cracked, resulting in the spill of hazardous material. the 14 customer made a claim on its insurer, which in turn made claims against us, among others, for the clean-up costs, which in this case are not significant. though we believe we did not test the weld that failed, if we are unable to prove this fact we may decide to or be compelled by a court to pay some of the clean-up costs. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the damages from any such claims, forcing us to bear these uninsured damages directly, which could harm our operating results and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenues. an accident or incident for which we are found partially or fully responsible, even if fully insured, may also result in negative publicity, which would harm our reputation among our customers and the public, cause us to lose existing and future contracts or make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, thereby significantly harming our operating performance. such an accident or incident might also make it more expensive or impossible for us to insure against similar events in the future. even unsuccessful claims relating to accidents could result in substantial costs, including litigation expenses, and diversion of our management resources.if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of trained engineers, scientists and other highly-skilled technicians at competitive wages, our operational performance may be harmed and our costs may increase. we believe that our success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of trained engineers, scientists and other highly-skilled, certified technicians at competitive wages. the demand for such employees is currently high, and we project that it may increase substantially in the future. accordingly, we have experienced increases in our labor costs, particularly in our services segment, but also, to a lesser extent, in our international segment. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have comparatively greater name recognition and resources. in addition, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. volatility in the future market price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. furthermore, the requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option awards that job candidates require to join our company. the markets for our products and services also require us to field personnel trained and certified in accordance with standards set by domestic or international standard-setting bodies, such as the american society of non-destructive testing. because of the limited supply of these certified technicians, we expend substantial resources maintaining in-house training and certification programs. if we fail to attract sufficient new personnel or fail to motivate and retain our current personnel, our ability to perform under existing contracts and orders or to pursue new business may be harmed, causing us to lose customers and revenues, and the costs of performing such contracts and orders may increase, which would likely reduce our margins.if we lose members of our senior management team upon whom we are dependent, we may not be able to manage our operations and achieve our strategic objectives. our future success depends to a considerable degree upon the availability, contributions, vision, skills, experience and effort of our senior management team. we do not maintain key person insurance on any of our employees other than dr.sotirios j. vahaviolos, our chairman, president and chief executive officer. we currently have no employment agreements with members of our senior management team other than with dr. vahaviolos. although we may enter into employment agreements with certain executive officers after this offering, these agreements will likely not guarantee the services of the individual for a specified period of time. all of the future agreements with members of our senior management team are expected to provide that 15 their employment is at-will and may be terminated by either us or the employee at any time and without notice. although we do not have any reason to believe that we may lose the services of any of these persons in the foreseeable future, the loss of the services of any of these persons might impede our operations or the achievement of our strategic and financial objectives. the loss or interruption of the service of members of our senior management team could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could significantly reduce our ability to manage our operations and implement our strategy.we operate in highly competitive markets and if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and revenues. we face strong competition from ndt and a variety of niche asset protection providers, both larger and smaller than we are. many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and could focus their substantial financial resources to develop a competing business model or develop products or services that are more attractive to potential customers than what we offer. some of our competitors are business units of companies substantially larger than us and have the ability to combine asset protection solutions into an integrated offering to customers who already purchase other types of products or services from them. our competitors may offer asset protection solutions at prices below or without cost in order to improve their competitive positions. any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, cause us to lower our prices in order to compete and reduce our market share and revenues, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.due to our dependency on customers in the oil and gas industry, we are susceptible to prolonged negative trends relating to this industry that could adversely affect our operating results. our customers in the oil and gas industry (including the petrochemical market) have accounted for a substantial portion of our historical revenues. specifically, they accounted for approximately 58%, 50% and 52% of our revenues for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. we continue to diversify our customer base into industries other than the oil and gas industry, but we may not be successful in doing so. if the oil and gas industry were to suffer a prolonged or significant downturn, our operating performance may be significantly harmed.our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or integrate acquired businesses successfully, which may inhibit our rate of growth, and any acquisitions that we do complete may expose us to a number of unanticipated operational and financial risks. our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, to a certain extent, on our ability to make acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses. we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets globally. we may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our current operations or expand into new markets. once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues, profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our current operations, or otherwise perform as expected. 16 some of the risks associated with our acquisition strategy include: unexpected loss of key personnel and customers of the acquired company; making the acquired companys financial and accounting standards consistent with our standards; assumption of liability for risks and exposures (including environmental-related costs), some of which we may not discover during our due diligence;and potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management. our ability to undertake acquisitions is limited by covenants in our credit agreement and our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses, impairment expenses related to goodwill and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. although management intends to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.catastrophic events, such as natural disasters, epidemics, war and acts of terrorism, could disrupt our business or the business of our customers, which could significantly harm our operations, financial results and cash flow. our operations and those of our customers are susceptible to the occurrence of catastrophic events outside our control, ranging from severe weather conditions to acts of war and terrorism. any such events could cause a serious business disruption that reduces our customers ability to or interest in purchasing our asset protection solutions, and have in the past resulted in order cancellations and delays because customer equipment, facilities or operations have been damaged, or are not operational or available. for instance, order cancellations and delays due to hurricane ike adversely affected our revenues in fiscal 2009. additionally, such events have resulted and may in the future result in substantial delays in the provision of solutions to our customers and the loss of valuable equipment. any cancellations, delays or losses due to a catastrophic event may significantly reduce our revenues and harm our operating performance.we face risks related to the current economic downturn. the global economy is currently in a pronounced economic downturn. global financial markets are continuing to experience disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, volatility in interest and currency exchange rates and overall uncertainty about economic stability. there may be further deterioration and volatility in the global economy, the global financial markets and consumer confidence. we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current global economic downturn or disruptions in the financial markets. the downturn has already resulted in some of our customers canceling and delaying orders for our solutions, as well as some customers delaying payment for items billed, which reduced our gross margins and operating income in fiscal 2009. some of our customers have also recently requested price concessions. in addition, current economic conditions have resulted in the reduced creditworthiness, inability to obtain sufficient financing, and bankruptcies of certain 17 customers, increasing our exposure to bad debt. for instance, in fiscal 2009, one of our larger customers filed for bankruptcy due to a downturn in the chemical industry combined with its own highly leveraged position. if economic conditions deteriorate further, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed. although we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations as planned, in light of current market conditions, our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, may harm our financial performance. the inability to obtain adequate financing from debt or capital sources could force us to self-fund strategic initiatives or even forgo certain opportunities, which in turn could potentially harm our performance.we expect to continue expanding and investing in our sales and marketing, operations, engineering, research and development capabilities and financial and reporting systems and, as a result, may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations. we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations. to effectively manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational, financial and reporting systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. we expect that all of these measures will require significant expenditures and will demand the attention of management. we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and adequately train additional qualified personnel. failure to manage our growth effectively could lead us to over or under-invest in technology and operations, result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, the loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new solutions. if our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenues could decline or may grow more slowly than expected and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.the success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to develop new asset protection solutions and increase the functionality of our current offerings. the market for asset protection solutions is impacted by technological change, uncertain product lifecycles, shifts in customer demands and evolving industry standards and regulations. we may not be able to successfully develop and market new asset protection solutions that comply with present or emerging industry regulations and technology standards. also, new regulations or technology standards could increase our cost of doing business. from time to time, our customers have requested greater functionality in our solutions. as part of our strategy to enhance our asset protection solutions and grow our business, we plan to continue making substantial investments in the research and development of new technologies. we believe our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to design new, competitive asset protection solutions, enhance our current solutions and provide new, value-added services. developing new solutions will require continued investment, and we may experience unforeseen technological or operational challenges. in addition, our asset protection software is complex and can be expensive to develop, and new software and software enhancements can require long development and testing periods. if we are unable to develop new asset protection solutions or enhancements to our current offerings, or if the market does not accept 18 such solutions, we will likely lose opportunities to realize revenues and customers and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.if our software produces inaccurate information or is incompatible with the systems used by our customers and makes us unable to successfully provide our solutions, it could lead to a loss of revenues and customers. our software is complex and, accordingly, may contain undetected errors or failures. software defects or inaccurate data may cause incorrect recording, reporting or display of information related to our asset protection solutions. any such failures, defects and inaccurate data may prevent us from successfully providing our asset protection solutions, which would result in lost revenues. software defects or inaccurate data may lead to customer dissatisfaction and our customers may seek to hold us liable for any damages incurred. as a result, we could lose customers, our reputation may be harmed and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. we currently serve a commercial, industrial and governmental customer base that uses a wide variety of constantly changing hardware, software solutions and operating systems. our asset protection solutions need to interface with these non-standard systems in order to gather and assess data. our business depends on the following factors, among others: our ability to integrate our technology with new and existing hardware and software systems; our ability to anticipate and support new standards, especially internet-based standards;and our ability to integrate additional software modules under development with our existing technology and operational processes. if we are unable to adequately address any of these factors, our results of operations and prospects for growth and profitability would be harmed.if we fail to successfully educate current and potential customers regarding the benefits of our asset protection solutions or the market for these solutions otherwise fails to develop, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted. our future success depends on continued and growing commercial acceptance of our asset protection solutions and our ability to obtain additional contracts. we anticipate that revenues related to our asset protection solutions will constitute a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. if we are unable to educate our potential customers about the advantages our solutions have over competing products and services, or our current customers stop purchasing our asset protection solutions, our operating results could be significantly harmed. in addition, because the asset protection solutions industry is rapidly evolving, we could lose insight into trends that may be emerging, which would further harm our competitive position by making it difficult to predict and respond to customer needs. if the market for our asset protection solutions does not continue to develop, our ability to grow our business would be limited and we might not be able to maintain profitability. our results of operations could be harmed if our operating expenses do not correspond with the timing of our revenues. most of our operating expenses, such as employee compensation and property rental expense, are relatively fixed over the short-term. moreover, our spending levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenues. as a result, if revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations, we would not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter without a substantial disruption to our business. this shortfall in revenues could adversely affect our operating results for that quarter and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially.the seasonal nature of our business reduces our revenues in our first and third fiscal quarters. our business is seasonal. our first and third fiscal quarter revenues are typically lower than our revenues in the second and fourth fiscal quarters because demand for our asset protection solutions from the oil and gas as well as the fossil and nuclear power industries increases during their non-peak production periods. for instance, u.s.refineries non-peak periods are generally in our second fiscal quarter, when they are retooling to produce more heating oil for winter, and in our fourth fiscal quarter, when they are retooling to produce more gasoline for summer. as a result of these trends, we generally have reduced cash flows in our second and fourth fiscal quarters, which may require us to borrow under our credit agreement or otherwise, to discontinue planned operations, or to curtail our operations. we expect that the negative impact of seasonality on our first and third fiscal quarter revenues and second and fourth fiscal quarter cash flows will continue.growth in revenues from our services segment or traditional ndt services relative to revenues from our products and systems and international segments, may reduce our overall gross profit margin. our gross profit margin on revenues from our services segment has historically been lower than our gross profit margin on revenues from our other segments because our services have higher labor-related costs. for instance, the gross profit margin in our services segment for fiscal 2009 was 28.9%, while our gross profit margin in our products and systems segment and in our international segment was 49.0% and 43.2%, respectively. our overall gross profit margin was 33.1% during the same period. moreover, our gross profit margin on traditional ndt services has historically been lower than our gross profit margin in our services segment as a whole. as a result, we expect our overall gross profit margin will be lower in periods when revenues from our services, and particularly from traditional ndt services, has increased as a percentage of total revenues and will be higher in periods when revenues from our international or products and systems segments has increased as a percentage of total revenues. fluctuations in our gross profit margin may affect our level of profitability in any period, which may negatively affect the price of our common stock.we have identified two significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. in connection with the audit of our financial results for fiscal 2009, we and our independent registered accounting firm reported to our audit committee two significant deficiencies concerning the substantial number of our internal control processes that are still being formalized or are manual in nature and the design of certain controls related to the financial statement closing process. these processes, at times, require significant effort to execute and, therefore, 20 generally may not provide a sustainable platform for an effective and efficient financial statement closing process. a significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the registrants financial reporting. if we are unable to remedy these significant deficiencies, or if we discover other significant deficiencies in the future, then we may not be able to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on our business or operating results.our business is currently subject to governmental regulation, and may become subject to modified or new government regulation that may negatively impact our ability to market our asset protection solutions. we incur substantial costs in complying with various government regulations and licensing requirements. for example, the transportation and overnight storage of radioactive materials used in providing certain of our asset protection solutions is subject to regulation under federal and state laws and licensing requirements. our services segment is currently licensed to handle radioactive materials by the u.s.nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) and 18state regulatory agencies. if we allegedly fail to comply with these regulations, we may be investigated and incur significant legal expenses associated with such investigations, and if we are found to have violated these regulations, we may be fined or lose one or more of our licenses to perform further projects. while we are investigated, we may be required to suspend work on the projects associated with our alleged noncompliance, resulting in loss of profits or customers, and damage to our reputation. for instance, in january, 2007, we were investigated due to an incident involving radiation exposure resulting from the misconduct of one of our employees. as a result, our customer required us to briefly suspend work on the associated project. we were found to have violated regulations governing the handling of radioactive materials, and as a result we incurred significant legal expenses. a more serious violation could result in lost profits and damage to our reputation. many of our customers have strict requirements concerning safety or loss time occurrences. in the future, federal, state, provincial or local governmental agencies may seek to change current regulations or impose additional regulations on our business. any modified or new government regulation applicable to our current or future asset protection solutions may negatively impact the marketing and provision of those solutions and increase our costs and the price of our solutions.a significant stockholder controls the direction of our business. the concentrated ownership of our common stock may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. dr.sotirios j. vahaviolos, our chairman, president and chief executive officer, will own approximately 43% of our outstanding common stock after this offering. as a result, dr.vahaviolos will have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation, and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. this concentration of ownership could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with differing interests from dr.vahaviolos. an inability to protect our intellectual property could negatively affect our business and results of operations. our ability to compete effectively depends in part upon the maintenance and protection of the intellectual property related to our asset protection solutions. patent protection is unavailable for certain aspects of the technology and operational processes important to our business. any patent held by us or to be issued to us, or any of our pending patent applications, could be unenforceable, challenged, invalidated or circumvented. some of our trademarks that are not in use may become available to others. to date, we have relied principally on copyright, trademark and trade secrecy laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property. however, we have not obtained confidentiality agreements from all of our customers and vendors, and although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with all of our employees in our products and systems segment and certain of our other employees involved in the development of our intellectual property, we cannot be certain that these agreements will be honored or enforceable. some of our confidentiality agreements are not in writing, and some customers are subject to laws and regulations that require them to disclose information that we would otherwise seek to keep confidential. although we do not transfer ownership of some of our more advanced asset protection products and systems and, instead, sell to our customers services using these products and systems, in part, in an effort to protect the intellectual property upon which they are based, this strategy may not be successful and our customers or third parties may reverse engineer or otherwise derive this intellectual property and use it without our authorization. policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive. the steps that we have taken or may take might not prevent misappropriation of the intellectual property on which we rely. in addition, effective protection may be unavailable or limited in jurisdictions outside the united states, as the intellectual property laws of foreign countries sometimes offer less protection or have onerous filing requirements. from time to time, third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights. litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. any litigation could be unsuccessful, cause us to incur substantial costs, divert resources away from our daily operations and result in the impairment of our intellectual property. failure to adequately enforce our rights could cause us to lose valuable rights in our intellectual property and may negatively affect our business.we may be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation related to allegations that our asset protection solutions infringe on the intellectual property of others, which could prevent us from offering those solutions. third-party patent applications and patents

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment BECAUSE WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AS A SOFTWARE COMPANY, OUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS UNCERTAIN Although FirePond was incorporated in 1983, we have only been focused on providing software products since 1997. Because we have only been focused on providing software products for a short time, we have a limited operating history pursuing this business model. The revenue and income potential of the market for e-business sales and marketing solutions is unproven. As a result, our historical financial statements are not an accurate indicator of our future operating results. In addition, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business, and we cannot forecast operating expenses based on our historical results. In evaluating FirePond, you should consider the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. If we are not able to successfully address these risks, our business could be harmedWE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES AND MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE We have incurred quarterly and annual losses intermittently since we were formed in 1983, and regularly since we undertook our strategic restructuring in late 1996. We incurred net losses of $27.0 million for fiscal 1997, $9.0 million for fiscal 1998 and $28.9 million for fiscal 1999. We expect to continue to incur losses on both a quarterly and annual basis and we are uncertain if or when we will become profitable. Moreover, we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing and research and development expenses, and, as a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not sustain our growth or generate sufficient revenues to attain profitabilityDISAPPOINTING QUARTERLY REVENUES OR OPERATING RESULTS COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO FALL We currently derive a significant portion of our license revenues in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders, and we generally recognize revenues from our licenses over the related implementation period. If we are unable to recognize revenues from one or more substantial license sales planned for a particular fiscal quarter, our operating results for that quarter would be seriously harmed. In addition, the purchase of our products typically involves a substantial commitment of resources by our customers or their consultants over an extended period of time. The time required to complete an implementation may vary from customer to customer and may be protracted due to unforeseen circumstances. Because our revenues from implementation, maintenance and training services are largely correlated with our license revenues, a decline in license revenues would also cause a decline in our services revenues in the same quarter and in subsequent quarters. Because our sales cycle is long, we may have difficulty predicting when we will recognize revenues. If our quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantiallyA SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS PERFORMED BY A THIRD PARTY INTERNATIONALLY, THE LOSS OF WHICH WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY HARM OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS A significant percentage of our product development work, and some of our implementation services, are performed by a third-party development organization in Minsk, Belarus. Unpredictable developments in the political, economic and social conditions in Belarus, or our failure to renew our consulting agreement with this organization on terms similar to our current agreement, could eliminate or reduce the availability of these product development and implementation services. If access to these services were to be unexpectedly eliminated or significantly reduced, our ability to meet development objectives vital to our ongoing strategy would be hindered, and our business could be seriously harmed. 4 9 THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON THE NEW FIREPOND APPLICATION SUITE, WHICH HAS BEEN RECENTLY INTRODUCED AND MAY NOT BE WIDELY ADOPTED BY OUR CUSTOMERS We expect to derive substantially all of our product license revenues in the future from the newly announced FirePond Application Suite and its component products, which were released in October 1999. Our business depends on the successful release, introduction and customer acceptance of this new suite of products. We expect that we will continue to depend on revenues from new and enhanced versions of the FirePond Application Suite, and our business would be harmed if our target customers do not adopt and expand their use of the FirePond Application Suite and its component productsOUR CUSTOM DEVELOPMENT SERVICES REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES, AND THE UNEXPECTED LOSS OF A CONTRACT COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES Custom development services revenues represented 99% of total revenues for fiscal 1997, 76% of total revenues for fiscal 1998 and 46% of total revenues for fiscal 1999. While we anticipate that custom development services revenues will decline as a percentage of total revenues as license revenues increase, we expect that it will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues. We also expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of these revenues. For example, for fiscal 1999, custom development services revenues from two customers accounted for 27% of our total revenues in the aggregate. An unexpected decrease in revenues from our custom development services and related maintenance contracts could adversely affect our overall revenues and our operating resultsFAILURE TO INCREASE OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS International revenues currently account for a significant percentage of our total revenues. We expect international revenues to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues in the future and we believe that we must continue to expand our international sales activities to be successfulHowever, foreign markets for our products may develop more slowly than currently anticipated. International revenues represented 11% in fiscal 1999. Our failure to expand our international sales could have a significant negative impact on our business FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED ORGANIZATION COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS If we fail to manage our geographically dispersed organization, we may fail to meet or exceed our objectives and our revenues may decline. We perform research and development activities in Minnesota, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Belarus, and our executive officers and other key employees are similarly dispersed throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. This geographic dispersion requires significant management resources that our locally-based competitors do not need to devote to their operations. In addition, the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resourcesINTEGRATION OF A NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM AND NEW PERSONNEL AND CONTINUED RAPID GROWTH MAY STRAIN OUR OPERATIONS We have recently experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion. All members of our senior management team have joined FirePond since May 1997. From July 1997 to December 1998, significant turnover of our employees occurred in conjunction with our change in focus from providing custom development services to providing packaged software products. A significant increase in domestic and international personnel will likely be necessary to address potential growth in our customer base and market opportunities. This may place a significant burden on our management and our internal resources. If we are not able to install adequate systems, procedures and controls to support our future operations in an efficient and timely manner, or if we are unable to otherwise manage growth effectively, our business could be harmed. 5 10 INTENSE COMPETITION FROM OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES COULD PREVENT US FROM INCREASING OR SUSTAINING REVENUES AND PREVENT US FROM ACHIEVING OR SUSTAINING PROFITABILITY The market for integrated e-business sales and marketing solutions is intensely competitive and we expect that this competition will increase. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater resources than we do. Therefore, they may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. If we are unable to compete effectively, our revenues could significantly declineFAILURE TO EXPAND OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS AND CONSULTING FIRMS WOULD IMPEDE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND DELAY THE GROWTH OF OUR REVENUES At times we rely on systems integrators and consulting firms to recommend our products to their customers and to install and support our products for their customers. To increase our revenues and implementation capabilities, we must develop and expand our relationships with systems integrators and consulting firms. If these firms fail to implement our products successfully for their clients, we may not have the resources to implement our products on the schedule required by the client which would result in our inability to recognize revenues from the license of our products to these customersIF e-BUSINESS SALES AND MARKETING SOLUTIONS ARE NOT WIDELY ADOPTED, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL Our products address a new and emerging market for e-business sales and marketing solutions. The failure of this market to develop, or a delay in the development of this market, would seriously harm our business. The success of e-business sales and marketing solutions depends substantially upon the widespread adoption of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce and business applications. The Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by the continued growth upon which our success dependsMoreover, critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet, such as security, reliability, cost, accessibility and quality of service, remain unresolved and may negatively affect the growth of Internet use or the attractiveness of commerce and business communication over the Internet IF WE ARE UNABLE TO INTRODUCE NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS THAT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, OUR REVENUES MAY DECLINE Our market is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Advances in Internet technology or in e-commerce software applications, or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing software, could lead to new competitive products that have better performance or lower prices than our products and could render our products obsolete and unmarketable. In addition, if a new software language or operating system becomes standard or is widely adopted in our industry, we may need to rewrite portions of our products in another computer language or for another operating system to remain competitive. If we are unable to develop new and enhanced products on a timely basis that respond to changing technology, our business could be seriously harmedWE DEPEND ON TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO US BY THIRD PARTIES, THE LOSS OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION We license technology from a small number of software providers for use with our products. In addition, the effective implementation of our products depends upon the successful operation of third-party licensed technology in conjunction with our products. We anticipate that we will continue to license and rely on technology from third parties in the future. This technology may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and some of the technology we license would be difficult to replace. The loss of the use of this technology would result in delays in the license and implementation of our products until equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated. In turn, this could prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products, delay new product introductions, or injure our reputation. 6 11 WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL AND MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO BE SUCCESSFUL Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior sales, engineering and management personnel, who perform important functions, and would be difficult to replace. Specifically, we believe that our future success is highly dependent on Klaus P. Besier, our chairman, president and chief executive officer, and other senior management personnel. The loss of the services of any key personnel, particularly senior management and engineers, could seriously harm our business. In addition, our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled employees, particularly marketing personnel, software engineers and other senior personnel. Our failure to attract and retain the highly-trained technical personnel that are integral to our product development, professional services and support teams may limit our ability to develop new products or product enhancementsCLAIMS MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST US IF WE HIRE FORMER EMPLOYEES OF OUR COMPETITORS, WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS Companies in the software industry, whose employees accept positions with competitors, frequently claim that those competitors have breached, or encouraged the breach of, noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements. These claims have been made against us in the past, and we may receive claims in the future as we hire additional qualified personnel. If a claim were to be made against us, it could result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against any of these claims, regardless of the merits of these claimsIF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROFESSIONAL SERVICE AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT, OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OR GROW OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED Our ability to continue to grow, to retain current and future customers and to recognize revenues from our licenses depends in part upon the quality of our professional service and customer support operations. Failure to offer adequate integration, consulting and other professional services in connection with the implementation of our products, and ongoing customer support, either directly or through third parties, could materially and adversely affect our operating results and reputation, and could cause demand for our products to declineIF OUR NEW AND COMPLEX PRODUCTS FAIL TO PERFORM PROPERLY, OUR REVENUES WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED Software products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors, or bugs, which result in product failures, or may cause our products to fail to meet our customers' expectations. Our products may be particularly susceptible to bugs or performance degradation because of the evolving nature of Internet technologies and the stress that full deployment of our products over the Internet to thousands of end-users may cause. Because we have only recently released our primary product, the FirePond Application Suite, it may be particularly susceptible to bugs. Product performance problems could result in loss of or delay in revenues, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of development resources or injury to our reputationPRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR CUSTOMERS' CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS Our products are critical to the business operations of our customers. If one of our products fails, a customer may assert a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for the failure. Our product liability insurance may not cover claims brought against us. Product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. Any product liability claims, whether or not successful, could seriously damage our reputation and our business. 7 12 IF WE OR OUR KEY SUPPLIERS OR CUSTOMERS FAIL TO BE YEAR 2000 COMPLIANT, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE SEVERELY DISRUPTED AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE HARMED The year 2000 problem creates a risk for us. The risk exists primarily in four areas: - potential warranty or other claims from our customers, which may result in significant expense to us; - failures of systems we use to run our business, which could disrupt our business operations; - potential failures of our products, particularly our central office-based systems, which may require that we incur significant unexpected expenses; and - the possibility that our potential customers will reduce spending on e-business software products such as ours as a result of significant spending on year 2000 remediation. Our products are generally integrated into computer systems involving sophisticated hardware and complex software products, which may not be year 2000 compliant. The failure of our customers' systems to be year 2000 compliant could limit our ability to remedy known defects in our products. Therefore, known or unknown defects that affect the operation of our software, could result in delay or loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation, or increased service or warranty costs and litigation costs, any of which could harm our businessOUR LIMITED ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary technology. Any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenuesExisting patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States Therefore, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult. Some of our contractual arrangements provide third parties with access to our source code and other intellectual property upon the occurrence of specified events. This access could enable these third parties to use our intellectual property and source code to develop and manufacture competing products, which would adversely affect our performance and ability to compete. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could materially adversely affect our future operating resultsCLAIMS ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF A THIRD PARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE TO US AND RESULT IN OUR LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT RIGHTS The software and other Internet-related industries are characterized by the existence of frequent litigation of intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our businessAny claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product shipment delays, disrupt our relationships with our customers or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If a claim against us is successful and we cannot obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms, license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affectedDIFFICULTIES AND FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS We may consider acquiring complementary businesses and technologies in the future. If we make an acquisition, we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders' percentage 8 13 ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, incur a one-time charge or be required to amortize goodwill. Additionally, we may not be able to successfully integrate any technologies, products, personnel or operations of companies that we may acquire in the future. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, and increase our expenses. If we are unable to successfully address any of these risks, our business could be seriously harmedCONTROL BY OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND THEIR AFFILIATES MAY LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF DIRECTOR ELECTIONS AND OTHER MATTERS REQUIRING STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL Upon completion of this offering, our executive officers, directors and their affiliates will own 16,739,150 shares, or approximately 51% of the outstanding shares of common stock, 50% if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. These stockholders can control substantially all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or discouraging a potential acquiror from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stockOUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE WHICH MAY LEAD TO LOSSES BY INVESTORS AND RESULT IN SECURITIES LITIGATION There has previously not been a public market for our common stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest will lead to the development of a trading market for our common stock or how liquid that market might become. The initial public offering price for the shares was determined by negotiations between us and the representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the stock market in general, the Nasdaq National Market, and securities of Internet and software companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. The trading prices of many Internet and software companies' stocks are at or near historical highs and these trading prices are substantially above historical levels. These trading prices may not be sustained. These broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against publicly traded companiesLitigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations FUTURE SALES OF OUR STOCK COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO FALL Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market after this offering could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securitiesPROVISIONS OF DELAWARE LAW AND OF OUR CHARTER AND BY-LAWS MAY MAKE A TAKEOVER MORE DIFFICULT AND LOWER THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and in Delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so, and the ability of public stockholders to change our management could be substantially impeded by these anti-takeover provisions. For example, we have a staggered board of directors and the right under our charter documents to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval, which could adversely affect the holders of our common stock. 9</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the following factors and the other information in this prospectus before deciding to purchase any shares of our common stock. risks relating to our dividend policy you may not receive any dividends, and the reduction or elimination of dividends would negatively affect the market price of our common stock. while our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy, effective upon the closing of this offering, we are not obligated to pay dividends on our common stock. dividend payments are within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. for example, we might not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, or we might suffer an uninsured loss of a satellite requiring significant and unplanned capital expenditures, resulting in an inability to pay dividends on our common stock in the intended amounts or at all. in addition, we are subject to certain restrictions on payment of dividends under panamsat's senior secured credit facilities or the indentures governing the issuer's senior discount notes and panamsat's 9% senior notes which, if triggered, may result in our modification or elimination of dividends. additionally, our need for cash to fund capital expenditures and new growth opportunities may increase. under those circumstances, our board of directors may decide to use cash from operations for increased capital expenditures or to take advantage of new growth opportunities. any reduction or elimination of dividends would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.our dividend policy may limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities. our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy, effective upon the closing of this offering, which reflects an intention to distribute a substantial portion of the cash generated by our business in excess of operating expenses and working capital requirements, interest and principal payments on our indebtedness and capital expenditures as regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. in developing this policy, we have made assumptions for and judgments about the first four full fiscal quarters following the closing of this offering as to our expected results of operations, anticipated levels of capital expenditures, cash interest expense, income taxes and working capital, and the continued availability of borrowings under panamsat's revolving credit facility. as a result of the dividend policy, our ability to finance any material expansion of our business or to fund our operations may be more limited than if we had retained all of our cash flow from operations. in addition, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business, including through acquisitions or increased capital spending, will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing. we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us at an acceptable cost, or at all. see "dividend policy and restrictions". risks relating to our businesswe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, comply with our debt covenants, repay our indebtedness and operate our business. as of december31, 2004, on a pro forma basis and after giving effect to the offering, we would have had outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3,244.6million, which would have represented approximately 75% of our total consolidated capitalization. panamsat currently has availability of $207.0million (net of standby letters of credit of approximately $43.0million) under its revolving credit facility. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. for example, it could: make it more difficult for the issuer to pay dividends on its common stock; make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt, and a failure to comply with any financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under our debt instruments and agreements; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on the issuer's common stock, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy, or other purposes; and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt. any of the above listed factors could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. furthermore, our interest expense could increase if interest rates rise because the entire amount of our debt under panamsat's senior secured credit facilities bears interest at floating rates. see "description of indebtednesssenior secured credit facilities". if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt, we would need to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell securities, none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all.we are a holding company with no operations, and unless we receive dividends, distributions, advances, transfers of funds or other payments from our subsidiaries, we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock and meet our debt service and other obligations. we are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. we do not have, apart from our ownership of panamsat, any independent operations. as a result, we will rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from panamsat and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock and meet our debt service and other obligations. the ability of panamsat and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us will depend on panamsat's operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the covenants contained in panamsat's senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing panamsat's 9%senior notes, and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. in addition, because we are a holding company, your claims as stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of our subsidiaries, including obligations under panamsat's senior secured credit facilities and 9%senior notes. therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our subsidiaries will be able to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and our subsidiaries' liabilities and obligations have been paid in full. despite our current leverage, we may still be able to incur significant additional indebtedness. this could further exacerbate the risks that we face. we will be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. although the indenture governing the senior discount notes and instruments governing panamsat's indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. if new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face, including those described above, could intensify.the terms of panamsat's senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the issuer's senior discount notes and panamsat's 9% senior notes may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions. panamsat's senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing the issuer's senior discount notes and panamsat's 9% senior notes contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. panamsat's senior secured credit facilities include financial covenants, including requirements that it: maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio; and not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio. the financial covenants contained in panamsat's senior secured credit facilities will become more restrictive over time. in addition, panamsat's senior secured credit facilities limit panamsat's ability to make capital expenditures and require that it use proceeds of certain asset sales that are not reinvested in panamsat's business to repay indebtedness under them. panamsat's senior secured credit facilities also include covenants restricting, among other things, its ability to: incur or guarantee additional debt or issue preferred stock; pay dividends, or make redemptions and repurchases, with respect to capital stock; create or incur certain liens; make certain loans, acquisitions, capital expenditures or investments; and engage in mergers, acquisitions, asset sales and sale and lease-back transactions. the indenture relating to the issuer's senior discount notes and the indenture relating to panamsat's 9% senior notes also contain numerous covenants including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue disqualified or preferred stock; create liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; pay dividends or make other equity distributions; repurchase or redeem capital stock; make investments or other restricted payments; sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies; create limitations on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or distributions to us; and engage in transactions with affiliates. the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in panamsat's senior secured credit facilities could result in a default under such facilities. if any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, enforce their security interest or require panamsat to apply all of its available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would result in an event of default under the issuer's senior discount notes and panamsat's senior notes. those lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt owed to them. if the debt under the senior secured credit facilities were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full or to repay the issuer's senior discount notes and panamsat's 9% senior notes and our other debt. see "description of indebtedness".our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to suffer a loss that is not adequately covered by insurance. our current satellite insurance does not protect us against all satellite-related losses that we may experience, and we do not have in-orbit insurance coverage for all of the satellites in our fleet. some of our insured satellites are covered by policies with significant exclusions or exceptions to coverage for failures of specific components identified by the underwriters as at risk for possible failure ("significant exclusion policies") and deductibles related to specific components identified by the insurers as the most likely to fail or by a policy with a lower coverage amount than the carrying value of its insurable costs. moreover, any claims under existing policies are subject to settlement with the insurers. as of december31, 2004, we had in effect launch and in-orbit policies covering seven satellites in the aggregate amount of approximately $690.1million, three of which were covered by significant exclusion policies. as our insurance policies expire, we may elect to reduce or eliminate insurance coverage relating to certain of our satellites to the extent permitted by our debt agreements if, in our view, exclusions make such policies ineffective or the costs of coverage make such insurance impractical and if we believe that we can more reasonably protect our business through the use of in-orbit spare satellites, backup transponders and self-insurance. seventeen of our satellites are currently uninsured. as of december31, 2004, our uninsured satellites and the satellites covered by significant exclusion policies had a total net book value of satellites and other insurable costs of approximately $971.7million. an additional risk to our business is that we do not generally obtain insurance to cover the risk of revenues lost as a result of satellite anomalies. as a result, even if insurance were to cover a loss relating to a launch or in-orbit failure, we would not be adequately compensated for lost revenues attributable to that loss. as of december31, 2004, the total net book value of satellites and other insurable costs, which includes certain sales-type leases plus the estimated amount of warranty liabilities related to transponders sold outright, less incentive obligations, totaled approximately $1,527.2million. in january 2005, our galaxy5 satellite was replaced by our galaxy12 satellite and was deorbited and the insurance policy for our galaxy10r satellite expired and was not renewed. the net book value and other insurable costs of our galaxy5 and galaxy10r satellites were $0 and approximately $98million as of december31, 2004, respectively. a partial or complete failure of a revenue-producing satellite, whether insured or not, could require additional, unplanned capital expenditures, an acceleration of planned capital expenditures, interruptions in service, a reduction in contracted backlog and lost revenue, and could limit our ability to pay dividends.our business is capital intensive, and we may not be able to access the capital markets when we would like to raise capital. we may not be able to raise adequate capital to complete some or all of our business strategies or to react rapidly to changes in technology, products, services or the competitive landscape. industry participants often face high capital requirements in order to take advantage of new market opportunities, respond to rigorous competitive pressures and react quickly to changes in technology. many of our competitors are committing substantial capital and, in many instances, are forming alliances to acquire or maintain market leadership. our business is capital intensive and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future.we are subject to significant and intensifying competition both within the fss industry and outside the industry from companies offering other means to transmit signals, such as through fiber optics. we face significant and intensifying competition in the fss industry in different regions around the world from companies such as: intelsatltd. and eutelsat s.a.; ses global, the entity formed by the november2001 acquisition of ge american communications,inc. by societe europeenne des satellites, the luxembourg-based operator of astra, one of europe's leading dth services; new skies satellites n.v.; and loral space& communicationsltd. among others. competition in the fss industry lowers prices, which can reduce our operating margins and the cash available to fund our operations, service our debt obligations and pay dividends. there has been a trend toward consolidation of major fss providers as customers increasingly demand more robust distribution platforms with network redundancies and worldwide reach, and we expect to face increased competition as a result of this trend. for example, ses global now has the world's largest satellite fleet, and the combined entity is now capable of providing service in many of the markets we serve. these and other direct competitors are likely to continue developing and launching satellites with greater power and more transponders, which may create satellite capacity at lower costs. in order to compete effectively, we may have to invest in similar technology. in addition, we believe that there are many companies that are seeking ways to improve the ability of existing land-based infrastructure, such as fiber optic cable, to transmit signals. any significant improvement or increase in the amount of land-based capacity, particularly with respect to the existing fiber optic cable infrastructure and point-to-point applications, may cause our video services customers to shift their transmissions to land-based capacity or make it more difficult for us to obtain new customers. if fiber optic cable networks or other ground-based high-capacity transmission systems are available to service a particular point, that capacity, when available, is generally less expensive than satellite capacity. as land-based telecommunications services expand, demand for some satellite-based services may be reduced. some of our direct and indirect competitors, both those in and outside of the fss industry, have greater financial resources and operating flexibility than we do. this may permit them to respond better to changes in the industry.we could be adversely affected if our customers default on their obligations to us. we rely on a limited number of customers to provide a substantial portion of our revenues and contracted backlog. for example, two customers, the directv group and the news corporation, comprised approximately 15% and 11%, respectively, of total revenues in 2004. no other customers represent more than 10% of revenues. some customers have in the past defaulted and, although we monitor our larger customers' financial performance and seek deposits, guarantees and other methods of protection against default where possible, our customers may in the future default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsmanagement overview". defaults by any of our larger customers or by a group of smaller customers who, collectively, represent a significant portion of our revenues could adversely affect our revenues, operating margins and cash flows.we are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. a significant portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states. for the years ended december31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, approximately 58%, 56% and 56% of our revenues, respectively, were generated from customers outside of the united states. accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. these risks include, but are not limited to: required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including telecommunications standards, noncompliance with which could restrict our ability to compete in certain foreign markets; withholding taxes or other taxes of our foreign income imposed by foreign countries, which could make the cost of our services in such markets prohibitively expensive or reduce cash flows; tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements imposed by foreign countries, which could limit our ability to compete in such markets; fluctuations in exchange rates that may affect the demand for our services and adversely affect the profitability in u.s. dollars of services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our services is made in the local currency; difficulty in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems, which could limit our ability to receive payments for services rendered; and changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, which could limit our ability to provide services, compete or receive payments for services rendered. our business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other regulatory, economic, social and political risks inherent in international business.our strategy to selectively pursue complementary acquisitions may present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs. we may selectively pursue complementary acquisitions and joint ventures. acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; difficulty with integration of personnel and financial and other systems; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. in addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in the integration of acquired businesses. also, the presence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired company that are unknown to us at the time of acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our business. our acquisition and joint venture strategy may not be successfully received by customers, and we may not realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures.we are a "controlled company" within the meaning established by the new york stock exchange and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. under the stockholders agreement among our sponsors, each of the sponsors is permitted to designate a certain number of directors to our board of directors, and the other sponsors are obligated to vote in favor of those designees. as a result, and because collectively, our sponsors will continue to beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock following this offering, we will be considered a "controlled company" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the new york stock exchange. under these rules, a "controlled company" may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including (1)the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (2)the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (3)the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. following this offering, we intend to utilize these exemptions. as a result, we will not have a majority of independent directors nor will we have compensation and nominating/corporate governance committees consisting entirely of independent directors. accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange.our sponsors may have significant influence on our company, including control over decisions that require the approval of equityholders, whether or not such decision is believed by the other equityholders to be in their own best interests. after the consummation of this offering, our sponsors will beneficially own approximately 58% of our common stock, or approximately 55% of our common stock if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares. as a result, our sponsors will have the collective ability to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the nomination and election of directors, the determination of our corporate and management policies and the determination, without the consent of our other stockholders, of the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. so long as our sponsors continue to own a majority of our outstanding common stock, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. risks relating to our industryonce launched and properly deployed, satellites are subject to significant operational risks due to various types of potential anomalies. satellites utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and, accordingly, are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. these risks include malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, that have occurred in our satellites and the satellites of other operators as a result of: the satellite manufacturer's error, whether due to the use of new and largely unproven technology or simply due to a manufacturing defect; problems with the power systems of the satellites, including: circuit failures causing reductions in the power output of the solar arrays on the satellites, which could require us to forego the use of some transponders initially and to turn off additional transponders in later years; and/or failure of the cells within the batteries, whose sole purpose is to power the payload and spacecraft operations during the daily eclipse periods which occur for brief periods of time during two 40-day periods around march21 and september21 of each year; problems with the control systems of the satellites, including: failure of the primary and/or backup spacecraft control processor, or scp; failure of the xenon-ion propulsion systems, or xips, used on certain boeing satellites, which is an electronic propulsion system that maintains the spacecraft's proper in-orbit position; and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh space environment. we have experienced anomalies in each of the categories described above. although we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of these anomalies in new satellites and provide for on-satellite backups for certain critical components to minimize or eliminate service disruptions in the event of failure, we may experience anomalies in the future, whether of the types described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components, and an on-satellite backup may not be available upon the occurrence of such an anomaly. in particular, we may experience additional anomalies relating to the failure of the scp in certain of our boeing model 601, or bss 601, satellites (not including our bss 601 hp satellites), various anomalies associated with xips in our bss 601 hp satellites or a progressive degradation of the solar arrays in certain of our boeing model 702, or bss 702, satellites. two bss 601 satellites that we operated in the past, as well as bss 601 satellites operated by others, have experienced a failure of the primary and backup scps. two of the bss 601 satellites that we currently operate have experienced a failure of the primary scp. certain of the bss 601 hp satellites have experienced various problems associated with their xips. we operate seven satellites of this type. three of our currently operated bss 601 hp satellites have experienced failures of both xips. we may in the future experience similar problems associated with xips or other propulsion systems on our satellites. based on a review of available data, we recently reduced our estimate of the useful life of one of our bss601hp satellites, pas-9. two of the three bss 702 satellites that we operate, as well as bss 702s of a similar design operated by others, have experienced a progressive degradation of their solar arrays causing a reduction in output power. along with the manufacturer, we continually monitor the problem to determine its cause and its expected effect. the power reduction may require us to permanently turn off certain transponders on the affected satellites to allow for the continued operation of other transponders, which could result in a loss of revenues, or may result in a reduction of the satellite's useful life. due to this continued degradation, based on a review of available data, we recently reduced our estimate of the useful lives of both satellites. on march17, 2004, our pas-6 satellite suffered an anomaly resulting in a loss of power. on april1, 2004, this satellite experienced another and more significant loss of power. following that event, we commenced deorbiting the satellite. as a result of the march17 event, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $99.9million within income from operations in the first quarter of 2004. this resulted in an approximate $63.3million after-tax non-cash charge to net loss. pas-6 had been previously replaced and, at the time of the anomaly, was being used as a backup for another satellite. on august3, 2004, the secondary xips on our galaxy 10r satellite permanently failed. the primary xips on this satellite had previously failed. in the absence of the primary and secondary xips, this satellite is expected to operate normally on its available backup fuel system for over three years. prior to this event, galaxy 10r was scheduled to have an estimated end of useful life in 2015. as a result, we anticipate an additional depreciation expense of approximately $3million per year. any single anomaly or series of anomalies could materially and adversely affect our operations, our revenues, our relationship with our current customers and our ability to attract new customers for our satellite services. in particular, future anomalies may result in the loss of individual transponders on a satellite, a group of transponders on that satellite or the entire satellite, depending on the nature of the anomaly and the availability of on-satellite backups. anomalies and our estimate of their future effect may also cause a reduction of the expected useful life of a satellite and contracted backlog. anomalies may also cause a reduction of the revenues generated by that satellite or the recognition of an impairment loss. finally, the occurrence of anomalies may adversely affect our ability to insure our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all. while some anomalies are covered by insurance policies, others are not or may not be covered. see "risks relating to our businessour financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to suffer a loss that is not adequately covered by insurance".new satellites are subject to launch failures, the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations. satellites are subject to certain risks related to failed launches. of the 38 satellites launched by us or our predecessors since 1983, three have resulted in launch failures. in addition, certain launch vehicles that we have used or are scheduled to use have experienced launch failures in the past. launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites, which can take 24months or longer, and to obtain other launch opportunities. such significant delays could materially and adversely affect our operations and our revenues. launch vehicles may also underperform, in which case the satellite may still be placed into service by using its onboard propulsion systems to reach the desired orbital location, resulting in a reduction in its useful life. in addition, although we have had launch insurance on all of our launches to date, if we were not able to obtain launch insurance on

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS Prospective investors should carefully consider the following information in conjunction with the other information contained in this Prospectus before purchasing any of the shares of Common Stock offered hereby. SENSITIVITY OF CUSTOMERS TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS The Company focuses exclusively on the economy segment of the timeshare industry and markets primarily to households with annual incomes between $25,000 and $50,000. The Company's targeted customers are generally more vulnerable to deteriorating economic conditions than consumers in the luxury or upscale markets. Any economic downturn could depress spending for Vacation Intervals, limit the availability or increase the cost of financing for the Company and its customers, and adversely affect the collectibility of the Company's loans to Vacation Interval buyers. During past economic slowdowns and recessions, Affiliated Companies experienced increased delinquencies in the payment of Vacation Interval promissory notes and monthly Club dues and consequent increased foreclosures and loan losses. During any future economic slowdown or recession, the Company projects that increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and loan losses are likely to occur. Similar adverse consequences could result from significant increases in transportation costs. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity and financial position. LEVERAGE The Company's future lending and development activities will likely be financed with indebtedness obtained under the Company's existing credit facilities or under credit facilities to be obtained by the Company in the future. Such credit facilities are and would likely be collateralized by Company assets and contain restrictive covenants. Among other consequences, terms of the Company's debt instruments could impair the Company's ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, significant business opportunities that may arise, general corporate purposes or other purposes. In addition, if the Company were to incur additional indebtedness, this could increase its vulnerability to adverse general economic and timeshare industry conditions and to increased competitive pressures. Finally, creditors' claims against the Company will be paid in full before the claims of shareholders in the event of a liquidation, bankruptcy or winding up of the Company. Historically and at March 31, 1997, after taking into account the amount of ineligible collateral and the 70% borrowing base, the Company's borrowings have approached the maximum amount available under its existing credit facilities. However, to the extent the Company continues to generate additional customer notes receivable through its sales efforts, such notes may be pledged to lenders under existing credit facilities for additional borrowings, subject to the 70% advance rate. See "-- Financing Customer Borrowings -- Borrowing Base" and "Business -- Existing Credit Facilities". BORROWER DEFAULTS The Company offers financing to the buyers of Vacation Intervals at the Company's resorts. These buyers make a down payment of at least 10% of the purchase price and deliver a promissory note to the Company for the balance; the promissory notes generally bear interest at a fixed rate, are payable over a seven year period, and are secured by a first mortgage on the Vacation Interval. The Company bears the risk of defaults on these promissory notes, and this risk is heightened inasmuch as the Company generally does not verify the credit history of its customers and will provide financing if the customer is presently employed and meets certain household income criteria The Company's credit experience is such that in 1997 it plans to allocate 22% of the purchase price of each Vacation Interval to a bad debt reserve. If a buyer of a Vacation Interval defaults, the Company generally must foreclose on the Vacation Interval and attempt to resell it; the associated marketing, selling, and administrative costs from the original sale are not recovered; and such costs must be incurred again to resell the Vacation Interval. Although the Company, in many cases, may have recourse against a Vacation Interval buyer for the unpaid price, the state of Texas and certain other states have laws which limit the Company's ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans. For example, under Texas law, if the Company were to pursue a post-foreclosure deficiency claim against a customer, the customer may file a court 16 17 proceeding to determine the fair market value of the property foreclosed upon. In such event, the Company may not recover a personal judgment against the customer for the full amount of the deficiency, but may recover only to the extent that the indebtedness owed to the Company exceeds the fair market value of the property. Accordingly, the Company has generally not pursued this remedyPrior to 1996, the Company sold customer promissory notes and mortgages to third parties, generally with recourse, as a means of financing its operations. As a result, the Company may be required to repurchase customer promissory notes previously sold which become delinquent. The Company takes these contingent obligations into account in establishing its allowance for uncollectible notes. At December 31, 1996, the Company had notes receivable (including notes unrelated to Vacation Intervals) in the approximate principal amount of $67.7 million, was contingently liable with respect to approximately $11.0 million principal amount of customer notes sold with recourse and had an allowance for doubtful notes of approximately $11.9 million. There can be no assurance that such reserves are adequate. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCING CUSTOMER BORROWINGS While the Company intends to use the proceeds of the Offering to pay off approximately $49.9 million of existing indebtedness, it will be required to continue to borrow to sustain operations. Borrowing Base. The Company has entered into agreements with lenders to borrow up to approximately $96 million collateralized by customer promissory notes and mortgages. The Company's lenders typically lend the Company 70% of the principal amount of performing notes, and Silverleaf Owners make payments on their promissory notes directly to the lender's collection center, where receipts are applied against the Company's loan balance. At December 31, 1996, the Company had a portfolio of approximately 17,626 customer promissory notes in the approximate principal amount of $66.8 million, of which approximately $11.6 million in principal amount of customer receivables were 61 days or more past due and therefore ineligible as collateral. At such date, the Company had borrowings from lenders in the approximate principal amount of $34.7 million secured by the customer loans. Historically and currently, after taking into account the amount of ineligible collateral and the 70% borrowing base, the Company's borrowings have approached the maximum amount available under its existing credit facilities. To the extent the Company generates additional customer notes receivable through its sales efforts, such notes may be pledged to lenders for additional borrowings, subject to the 70% advance rate. Negative Cash Flow. The Company ordinarily receives only 10% of the purchase price on the sale of a Vacation Interval but must pay in full the costs of development, marketing, and sale of the interval. Maximum borrowings available under the Company's current credit agreements may not be sufficient to cover these costs, thereby straining capital resources, liquidity, and capacity to growInterest Rate Mismatch. At December 31, 1996, the Company's portfolio of customer loans had a weighted average fixed interest rate of 14.7%. At such date, the Company's borrowings (which bear interest at variable rates) against the portfolio had a weighted average cost of funds of 10.8%. The Company has historically derived net interest income from its financing activities because the interest rates it charges its customers who finance the purchase of their Vacation Intervals exceed the interest rates the Company pays to its lenders. Because the Company's indebtedness bears interest at variable rates and the Company's customer receivables bear interest at fixed rates, increases in interest rates will erode the spread in interest rates that the Company has historically enjoyed and could cause the interest expense on the Company's borrowings to exceed its interest income on its portfolio of customer loans. The Company does not currently engage in interest rate hedging transactions. Therefore, any increase in interest rates, particularly if sustained, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity and financial positionTo the extent interest rates decrease generally on loans available to the Company's customers, the Company faces an increased risk that customers will pre-pay their loans and reduce the Company's income from financing activities. See "Business -- Customer Financing" Maturity Mismatch. The Company typically provides financing to customers over a seven year period which customer notes have an average maturity of 5.6 years. The Company's related revolving credit borrowings, however, mature between October 1998 and August 2003, with most of such borrowings maturing in 1999. Accordingly, there is a mismatch between the Company's anticipated cash receipts and cash disbursements. 17 18 Although the Company has historically been able to secure financing sufficient to fund its operations, it does not presently have agreements with its lenders to extend the term of its existing funding commitments or to replace such commitments upon their expiration. Failure to obtain such refinancing facilities could require the Company to sell its portfolio of customer loans, probably at a substantial discount, or to seek other alternatives to enable it to continue in business. While the Company has been successful in obtaining financing to date, there is no assurance it will be able to do so in the future. See "-- Acceleration of Deferred Taxes" and "-- Alternative Minimum Taxes"Impact on Sales. Limitations on the availability of financing would inhibit sales of Vacation Intervals due to (i) the lack of funds to finance the initial negative cash flow that results from sales that are financed by the Company, and (ii) reduced demand if the Company is unable to provide financing to purchasers of Vacation Intervals. REPAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS OWED TO OFFICER AND AFFILIATES Mr. Mead will realize benefits from the Offering that will not be received by other persons participating in the Offering. Such benefits include the repayment by the Company of indebtedness owed to Mr. Mead and his affiliates. Thus, Mr. Mead has interests that conflict with the interests of persons acquiring Common Stock in the Offering. Mr. Mead and his affiliates will receive approximately $9.9 million of the net proceeds of the Offering for the repayment of debt owed by the Company to him and his affiliates. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions -- Repayment of Affiliated Debt", "Principal Shareholders", and "Management -- Employment and Noncompetition Agreements". REGULATION OF MARKETING AND SALES OF VACATION INTERVALS AND RELATED LAWS The Company's marketing and sales of Vacation Intervals and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government and the states and jurisdictions in which the Existing Resorts are located and in which Vacation Intervals are marketed and sold. On a federal level, the Federal Trade Commission has taken the most active regulatory role through the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or competition in interstate commerce. Other federal legislation to which the Company is or may be subject includes the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Equal Opportunity Credit Act and Regulation B, the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968In response to the fraudulent marketing practices which plagued the timeshare industry in the 1980's, in the late 1980's and early 1990's, various states enacted legislation aimed at curbing such abuses. Texas and Missouri, the only states in which the Company currently owns resorts, have adopted specific laws and regulations regarding the sale of Vacation Interval ownership programs. The laws of most states, including Texas, require the Company to file with a designated state authority for its approval a detailed offering statement describing the Company and all material aspects of the project and the sale of Vacation Intervals prior to selling to residents of that state. The laws of these states require the Company to file numerous documents and supporting information with the state agency responsible for the regulation of Vacation Intervals. When the agency determines that a project may be sold, it will issue a public report for the project. The Company is required to deliver an offering statement or public report to all prospective purchasers of a Vacation Interval who are Texas residents, together with certain additional information concerning the terms of the purchase, regardless of whether the resort is located in Texas. In Missouri, the Company is required to make certain disclosures in its sales documents. Laws in each state where the Company currently sells Vacation Intervals generally grant the purchaser of a Vacation Interval the right to cancel a contract of purchase at any time within approximately five calendar days following the date the contract was signed by the purchaser. Most states have other laws which regulate the Company's activities and protect purchasers, such as real estate licensure laws; travel sales licensure laws; anti-fraud laws; consumer protection laws; telemarketing laws; prize, gift and sweepstakes laws; and other related lawsThe Company believes it is in material compliance with federal, Texas, and Missouri laws and regulations to which it is currently subject relating to the sale and marketing of timeshare resorts. However, the Company is 18 19 normally and currently the subject of a number of consumer complaints generally relating to marketing or sales practices filed with relevant authorities, and there can be no assurance that all of these complaints can be resolved without adverse regulatory actions or other consequences. The Company expects some level of consumer complaints in the ordinary course of its business as the Company targets audiences which generally are less financially sophisticated and more susceptible to intensive sales practices than more affluent customers. There can be no assurance that the costs of resolving consumer complaints or of qualifying under Vacation Interval ownership regulations in all jurisdictions in which the Company desires to conduct sales will not be significant, that the Company is in material compliance with applicable federal, Texas, Missouri, or other laws and regulations, or that violations of law will not have adverse implications for the Company, including negative public relations, potential litigation, and regulatory sanctions. The expense, negative publicity, and potential sanctions associated with the failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity, or financial position. See "Business -- Governmental Regulation"During the 1980's and continuing through the present, the timeshare industry has been and continues to be afflicted with negative publicity and prosecutorial attention due, among other things, to marketing practices which were widely viewed as deceptive or fraudulent. Among the many timeshare companies which have been the subject of federal, state and local enforcement actions and investigations in the past were certain of the Affiliated Companies and their affiliates. Some of the settlements, injunctions and decrees resulting from litigation and enforcement actions (the "Orders") to which certain of the Affiliated Companies consented purport to bind all successors and assigns, and accordingly bind the Company. In addition, at that time the Company was directly a party to one such Order issued in Missouri. No past or present officers, directors or employees of the Company or any Affiliated Company were named as subjects or respondents in any of these Orders; however, each Order purports to bind generically unnamed "officers, directors and employees" of certain Affiliated Companies. Therefore, certain of these Orders may be interpreted to be enforceable against the present officers, directors and employees of the Company even though they were not individually named as subjects of the enforcement actions which resulted in these Orders. These Orders require, among other things, that all parties bound by the Orders, including the Company, refrain from engaging in deceptive sales practices in connection with the offer and sale of Vacation Intervals. In one case in 1988, an Affiliated Company pled guilty to deceptive uses of the mails in connection with promotional sales literature mailed to prospective timeshare purchasers and agreed to pay a judicially imposed fine of $1.5 million and restitution of $100,000. The requirements of the Orders are substantially what applicable state and federal laws and regulation mandate, but the consequence of violating the Order may be that sanctions (including possible financial penalties and suspension or loss of licensure) may be imposed more summarily and may be harsher than would be the case if the Orders did not bind the Company. In addition, the existence of the Orders may be viewed negatively by prospective regulators in jurisdictions where the Company does not now do business, with attendant risks of increased costs and reduced opportunitiesRecently, the Company has been the subject of some consumer complaints which have triggered governmental investigations into the Company's affairs. In March 1997, the Company entered into an Assurance of Voluntary Compliance with the Texas Attorney General, in which the Company agreed to make additional disclosure to purchasers of Vacation Intervals regarding the limited availability of its Endless Escape program during certain periods. The Company paid $15,200 for investigatory costs and attorneys' fees of the Attorney General in connection with this matter. Also, in March 1997, the Company entered into an agreed order (the "Agreed Order") with the Texas Real Estate Commission requiring the Company to comply with certain aspects of the Texas Timeshare Act, Texas Real Estate License Act and Rules of the Texas Real Estate Commission, with which it had allegedly been in non-compliance until mid-1995. The allegations included (i) the Company's admitted failure to register the Missouri Destination Resorts in Texas (due to its misunderstanding of the reach of the Texas Timeshare Act); (ii) payment of referral fees for Vacation Interval sales, the receipt of which was improper on the part of the recipients; and (iii) miscellaneous other actions alleged to violate the Texas Timeshare Act, which the Company denied. While the Agreed Order acknowledges that Silverleaf independently resolved ten consumer complaints referenced in the Agreed Order, discontinued the practices complained of, and had registered the Destination Resorts during 1995 and 1996, the Texas Real Estate Commission ordered Silverleaf to cease its discontinued practices and enhance its disclosure to purchasers of Vacation Intervals. In the Agreed Order, Silverleaf agreed to make a voluntary donation of $30,000 to the State of Texas. The Agreed Order also 19 20 directs Silverleaf to revise its training manual for timeshare salespersons and verification officers. While the Agreed Order resolved all of the alleged violations contained in complaints received by the Texas Real Estate Commission through December 31, 1996, the Company expects to encounter some level of consumer complaints in the ordinary course of its business. See "Business -- Governmental Regulation". CONCENTRATION IN TIMESHARE INDUSTRY Because the Company's operations are conducted solely within the timeshare industry, any adverse changes affecting the timeshare industry such as an oversupply of timeshare units, a reduction in demand for timeshare units, changes in travel and vacation patterns, changes in governmental regulations or taxation of the timeshare industry, as well as negative publicity about the timeshare industry, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial position. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". COMPETITION The timeshare industry is highly fragmented and includes a large number of local and regional resort developers and operators. However, some of the world's most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies, such as, Marriott Ownership Resorts ("Marriott"), The Walt Disney Company ("Disney"), Hilton Hotels Corporation ("Hilton") and Hyatt Corporation ("Hyatt"), have recently entered the industry. Other companies in the timeshare industry, including Signature Resorts, Inc. ("Signature"), Fairfield Communities, Inc. ("Fairfield"), Vacation Break USA, Inc. ("Vacation Break"), Vistana, Inc. ("Vistana") and Ramada Vacation Suites ("Ramada"), a subsidiary of Mego Financial Corporation, are public companies with enhanced access to capital and other resourcesFairfield and Signature own timeshare resorts in or near Branson, Missouri, which compete with the Company's Holiday Hills and Ozark Mountain Resorts, and Signature owns a resort which is located near and competes with the Company's Piney Shores Resort. Based on published industry data and reports, except for Fairfield and Signature, the Company does not believe that any of the competitors named above own timeshare resorts in Texas or Missouri and believes that such competitors generally target consumers with higher annual incomes than the Company. Nonetheless, competitors may possess significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than the Company, and there can be no assurance that such competitors will not significantly reduce the price of their Vacation Intervals or offer greater convenience, services or amenities than the CompanyWhile the Company's principal competitors are developers of timeshare resorts, the Company is also subject to competition from other entities engaged in the commercial lodging business, including condominiums, hotels and motels; others engaged in the leisure business; and, to a lesser extent, from campgrounds, recreational vehicles, tour packages and second home sales. A reduction in the product costs associated with any of these competitors, or an increase in the Company's costs relative to such competitors' costs, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity and financial positionNumerous businesses, individuals and other entities will compete with the Company in seeking properties for development and acquisition of resorts. Some of these competitors will be larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. Such competition may result in a higher cost for properties the Company wishes to acquire or may cause the Company to be unable to acquire suitable properties for the development of new resorts. DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION AND PROPERTY ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES The Company intends to selectively develop and acquire new resorts and continue the expansion of the Existing Resorts. Acquiring and developing new resorts will place substantial demands on the Company's liquidity and capital resources, as well as on its personnel and administrative capabilities. Risks associated with the Company's development and construction activities include the following: construction costs or delays at a property may exceed original estimates, possibly making the expansion or development uneconomical or unprofitable; sales of Vacation Intervals at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable; and financing may be unavailable or may not be available on favorable terms for development of, or the continued sales of Vacation Intervals at, a property. The Company projects that its planned expansion at the 20 21 Existing Resorts alone will cost in excess of $100 million. Additionally, the Company currently projects that it will cost in excess of $47.6 million to acquire and fully develop its planned new drive-to resorts in Missouri and Illinois. The Company also has plans to develop a tract of land it currently owns in Mississippi as a new destination resort at an estimated cost of $4.5 million. There can be no assurance the Company will develop and acquire new resorts or expand the Existing Resorts. The Company does not and upon the consummation of the Offering will not have the financing available to complete all of its planned expansion as set forth in "Business -- The Existing Resorts" and "Business -- Growth Strategy"In addition, the Company's development and construction activities, as well as its ownership and management of real estate, are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local laws regulating such matters as environmental and health concerns, protection of endangered species, water supplies, zoning, land development, land use, building design and construction, marketing and sales, and other matters. Such laws and difficulties in obtaining, or failing to obtain, the requisite licenses, permits, allocations, authorizations and other entitlements pursuant to such laws could impact the development, completion, and sale of the Company's projects. See "-- Regulation of Marketing and Sales or Vacation Intervals and Related Laws". The enactment of "slow growth" or "no-growth" initiatives or changes in labor or other laws in any area where the Company's projects are located could also delay, affect the cost or feasibility of, or preclude entirely the expansion planned at each of the Existing Resorts or the development of other resortsThe Company's resorts are located in rural areas, often requiring the Company to provide public utility water and sanitation services in order to proceed with development. Such activities are subject to permission and regulation by governmental agencies, the denial or conditioning of which could limit or preclude development. Operation of the utilities also subjects the Company to risk of liability in connection with both the quality of fresh water provided and the treatment and discharge of waste-water. See "Business -- Governmental Regulation"While the Company's construction activities typically are performed by third-party contractors whose performance cannot be assured by the Company, construction claims may be asserted against the Company for construction defects and such claims may give rise to liabilities. Certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of such propertySee "Business -- Growth Strategy", "Business -- Development and Acquisition Process" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL The Company's success depends to a large extent upon the experience and abilities of Mr. Mead, Sharon K. Brayfield, and David T. O'Connor, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President, and Executive Vice President -- Sales, respectively. The loss of the services of any one of these key individuals could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial position. See "Management -- Employment and Noncompetition Agreements". The Company's success is also dependent upon its ability to attract and maintain qualified acquisition, development, marketing, management, administrative and sales personnel. The ability to attract such personnel will become particularly important as the Company grows and develops additional resorts, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in attracting and/or retaining such personnel. COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS GOVERNING ACCESSIBILITY OF FACILITIES TO DISABLED PERSONS A number of state and federal laws, including the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), impose requirements related to access and use by disabled persons of a variety of public accommodations and facilities. The ADA requirements did not become effective until after January 1, 1991. Although the Company believes the Existing Resorts are substantially in compliance with laws governing the accessibility of its facilities to disabled persons, the Company will incur additional costs of complying with such laws. Additional federal, state and local legislation may impose further burdens or restrictions on the Company, the Clubs, or the Master Club at the Existing Resorts with respect to access by disabled persons. The ultimate cost of compliance with such legislation is not currently ascertainable, and, while such costs are not expected to 21 22 have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, such costs could be substantial. GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION WITHIN TEXAS AND MISSOURI At March 31, 1997, all of the Company's resorts and substantially all of the Company's customers and borrowers were located in Texas and Missouri. The Company's performance and the value of its properties is affected by regional factors, including local economic conditions (which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors) and the local regulatory climate. The Company's current concentration in the Texas and Missouri markets could make the Company more susceptible to adverse events or conditions which affect these areas in particular. POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as common law, the owner or operator of real property generally is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on, in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or lease a property or to borrow money using such real property as collateral. Other federal and state laws require the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing material when such material is in poor condition or in the event of construction, demolition, remodeling or renovation. Other statutes may require the removal of underground storage tanks. Noncompliance with these and other environmental, health or safety requirements may result in the need to cease or alter operations at a property. Further, the owner or operator of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with the site. Phase I environmental reports (which typically involve inspection without soil sampling or ground water analysis) were prepared in 1994 by independent environmental consultants for each Existing Resort and did not reveal, nor is the Company aware of, any environmental liability that would have, a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial position. No assurance, however, can be given that these reports reveal all environmental liabilities or that no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to the CompanyCertain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period. A transfer of the property may not relieve an owner of such </td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock. if any of the following risks is realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. in that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our business and industry we are a rapidly growing company, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful. we are a rapidly growing company. our ability to forecast our future operating results is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly evolving industries. if our assumptions regarding these uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, our business could suffer and the trading price of our stock may decline.if we are unable to sustain our revenue growth rate, we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. from the year ended december31, 2011 to the year ended december31, 2014, our revenue grew from $31.0million to $76.9 million, which represents a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 35%. although we have experienced rapid growth historically and currently have high renewal rates, we may not continue to grow as rapidly in the future and our renewal rates may decline. any success that we may experience in the future will depend in large part on our ability to, among other things: maintain and expand our customer base; increase revenues from existing customers through increased or broader use of our products and professional services within their organizations; improve the performance and capabilities of our products through research and development; continue to develop our cloud-based solutions; maintain the rate at which customers purchase our content subscriptions and maintenance and support; continue to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally; and successfully compete with other companies. if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile, and it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability. you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth. we have not been profitable historically and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. we have posted a net loss in each year since inception, including net losses of approximately $12.4 million in 2012, $18.9 million in 2013, $32.6 million in 2014 and $7.7 million in the three months ended march 31, 2015. as of march 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $261.4 million. while we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we are not certain whether or when we will obtain a high enough volume of sales of our products and professional services to sustain or increase our growth or achieve or maintain profitability in the future. we also expect our costs to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future operating results if our revenue does not increase. in particular, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on: research and development related to our offerings, including investments in our research and development team; sales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our sales organization, both domestically and internationally; continued international expansion of our business; expansion of our professional services organization; and general administration expenses, including legal and accounting expenses related to being a public company. these investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. if we are unable to increase our revenue at a rate sufficient to offset the expected increase in our costs, our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability over the long term. additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. if our revenue growth does not meet our expectations in future periods, our financial performance may be harmed, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.if our products or professional services fail to detect vulnerabilities or incorrectly detect vulnerabilities, or if our products contain undetected errors or defects, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. if our products or professional services fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers cyber security infrastructure, or if our products or professional services fail to identify and respond to new and increasingly complex methods of cyber attacks, our business and reputation may suffer. there is no guarantee that our products or professional services will detect all vulnerabilities, especially in light of the rapidly changing security landscape to which we must respond. additionally, our products may falsely detect vulnerabilities or threats that do not actually exist. for example, our metasploit offering relies on information provided by an active community of more than 45,000 security researchers as of april 2015, who contribute new exploits, attacks and vulnerabilities. if the information from these third parties is inaccurate, the potential for false indications of security vulnerabilities increases. these false positives, while typical in the industry, may impair the perceived reliability of our offerings and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products and professional services and could result in negative publicity, loss of customers and sales and increased costs to remedy any problem. our products may also contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released. we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades and we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in the future in new or enhanced products after commercial release. defects may cause our products to be vulnerable to attacks, cause them to fail 15 to detect vulnerabilities, or temporarily interrupt customers networking traffic. any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our products may damage our customers business and could hurt our reputation. if our products or professional services fail to detect vulnerabilities for any reason, we may incur significant costs, the attention of our key personnel could be diverted, our customers may delay or withhold payment to us or elect not to renew or other significant customer relations problems may arise. we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our products. a material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our products may harm our business and operating results. an actual or perceived security breach or theft of the sensitive data of one of our customers, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or professional services, could adversely affect the markets perception of our offerings and subject us to legal claims.we face intense competition in our market. the market for cyber security solutions is highly fragmented, intensely competitive and constantly evolving. we compete with an array of established and emerging security software and services vendors. with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense going forward. our competitors include: vulnerability management and assessment vendors, including qualys and tenable network security; diversified security software and services vendors, including mcafee (a subsidiary of intel), ibm and hp; security services specialists, including mandiant (a subsidiary of fireeye); and providers of point solutions that compete with some of the features present in our solutions. some of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business user recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence. in addition, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. larger and more established companies may focus on cyber security and could directly compete with us. smaller companies could also launch new products and services that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. with the introduction of new technologies, the evolution of our offerings and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. in addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and can bundle competing products and services with other software offerings. as a result, customers may choose a bundled product offering from our competitors, even if individual products have more limited functionality than our solutions. these competitors may also offer their products at a lower price as part of this larger sale, which could increase pricing pressure on our offerings and cause the average sales price for our offerings to decline. these larger competitors are also often in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending, and will therefore not be as susceptible to economic downturns. furthermore, our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources and product and services offerings in the markets we address. in addition, current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources. as a result of such relationships and acquisitions, our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. the market for our products and professional services is new and unproven and may not grow. we believe our future success will depend in large part on the growth, if any, in the market for cyber security data and analytics. this market is nascent, and as such, it is difficult to predict important market trends, including the potential growth, if any. to date, the majority of enterprise spend on cyber security has been on threat protection products, such as network, endpoint and web security that are designed to stop threats from penetrating corporate networks. organizations that use these security products may believe that their existing security solutions sufficiently protect access to their sensitive business data. therefore, they may continue allocating their cyber security budgets to these products and may not adopt our products and professional services in addition to, or in lieu of, such traditional products. further, sophisticated cyber attackers are skilled at adapting to new technologies and developing new methods of gaining access to organizations sensitive business data, and changes in the nature of advanced cyber threats could result in a shift in it budgets away from products and professional services such as ours. in addition, while recent high visibility attacks on prominent enterprises and governments have increased market awareness of the problem of cyber attacks, if cyber attacks were to decline, or enterprises or governments perceived that the general level of cyber attacks have declined, our ability to attract new customers and expand our sale to existing customers could be materially and adversely affected. if products and professional services such as ours are not viewed by organizations as necessary, or if customers do not recognize the benefit of our offerings as a critical layer of an effective cyber security strategy, our revenue may not grow as quickly as expected, or may decline, and the trading price of our stock could suffer. it is therefore difficult to predict how large the market will be for our solutions. in addition, it is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewal rates, customer demand for our products and professional services, the size and growth rate of the market for cyber security data analytics, the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products. any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with our offerings and those of our competitors. if these offerings do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for solutions in our market caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions, or otherwise, it could result in reduced customer orders, early terminations, reduced renewal rates or decreased revenue, any of which would adversely affect our business operations and financial results. you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter in this new and unproven market.forecasts of our market and market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, there can be no assurance that our business will grow at similar rates, or at all. growth forecasts included in this prospectus relating to our market opportunity and the expected growth in the market for information and data security analytics are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates which may prove to be inaccurate. even if these markets meet our size estimates and experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. accordingly, the forecasts of market growth included in this prospectus should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.organizations may be reluctant to purchase cyber security data analytics offerings that are cloud-based due to the actual or perceived vulnerability of cloud solutions. some organizations have been reluctant to use cloud solutions for cyber security, such as userinsight, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the reliability or security of the technology delivery model associated with this solution. if we or other cloud service providers experience security incidents, breaches of customer data, disruptions in service delivery or other problems, the market for cloud solutions as a whole may be negatively impacted. if we do not continue to innovate and offer products and professional services that address the dynamic threat landscape, we may not remain competitive, and our revenue and operating results could suffer. the cyber security market is characterized by rapid technological advances, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. our success also depends on continued innovation to provide features that make our products and professional services responsive to the dynamic threat landscape. while we continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to ensure that our products continue to address the cyber security risks that our customers face, the introduction of products and services embodying new technologies could render our existing products or services obsolete or less attractive to customers. in addition, developing new products and product enhancements is expensive and time consuming, and there is no assurance that such activities will result in significant cost savings, revenue or other expected benefits. if we spend significant time and effort on research and development and are unable to generate an adequate return on our investment, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. further, we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or customer requirements or the dynamic threat landscape on a timely basis, or at all.to date, we have derived a substantial majority of our revenue from customers using our threat exposure management offerings. if we are unable to renew or increase sales of our threat exposure management offerings, or if we are unable to increase sales of our other offerings, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. although we have recently introduced new products and professional services, we derive and expect to continue to derive a substantial majority of our revenue from customers using certain of our threat exposure management offerings, nexpose and metasploit. approximately two-thirds of our revenue was attributable to nexpose in each of the last three fiscal years. as a result, our operating results could suffer due to: any decline in demand for our threat exposure management offerings; failure of our threat exposure management offerings to detect vulnerabilities in our customers it environments; the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our threat exposure management offerings; technological innovations or new standards that our threat exposure management offerings do not address; sensitivity to current or future prices offered by us or competing solutions; and our inability to release enhanced versions of our threat exposure management offerings on a timely basis in response to the dynamic threat landscape. our inability to renew or increase sales of our threat exposure management offerings, including content subscriptions and maintenance and support, or a decline in prices of our threat exposure management offerings would harm our business and operating results more seriously than if we derived significant revenues from a variety of offerings. for example, our sales and marketing of our userinsight product for incident detection and response is relatively new, and it is uncertain whether userinsight will gain market acceptance. we are also investing heavily in the expansion of our security advisory services offerings, which we believe will help drive demand for our other products in addition to being a stand-alone service. any factor adversely affecting sales of our products or professional services, including release cycles, market acceptance, competition, performance and reliability, reputation and economic and market conditions, could adversely affect our business and operating results. if metasploit were to be used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber security infrastructures of third parties, our reputation and business could be harmed. although metasploit is a penetration testing tool that is intended to allow organizations to test the effectiveness of their cyber security programs, metasploit has in the past and may in the future be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber security infrastructures of third parties. while we have incorporated certain features into metasploit to deter misuse, there is no guarantee that these controls will not be circumvented or that metasploit will only be used defensively or for research purposes, and any actual or perceived security breach, malicious intrusion or theft of sensitive data in which metasploit is believed to have been used could adversely affect perception of, and demand for, our offerings. further, the identification of new exploits and vulnerabilities by the metasploit community may enhance the knowledge base of cyber attackers or enable them to undertake new forms of attacks. if any of the foregoing were to occur, we could suffer negative publicity and loss of customers and sales, as well as possible legal claims.a component of our growth strategy is dependent on our continued international expansion, which adds complexity to our operations. we market and sell our products and professional services throughout the world and have personnel in many parts of the world. for the year ended december31, 2014, international operations generated 12% of our revenue. our growth strategy is dependent, in part, on our continued international expansion. we expect to conduct a significant amount of our business with organizations that are located outside the united states, particularly in europe and asia. we cannot assure you that our expansion efforts into international markets will be successful in creating further demand for our products and professional services outside of the united states or in effectively selling our products and professional services in the international markets that we enter. our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks, including: foreign currency exchange fluctuations; trade and foreign exchange restrictions; economic or political instability in foreign markets; greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods; changes in regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to data privacy, data protection and data security regulations; difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; the uncertainty and limitation of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; costs of compliance with foreign laws and regulations and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations; costs of compliance with u.s. laws and regulations for foreign operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or provide our solutions in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance; heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, and irregularities in, financial statements; the potential for political unrest, acts of terrorism, hostilities or war; 19 management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion; costs associated with language localization of our products; and costs of compliance with multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures. our business, including the sales of our products and professional services by us and our channel partners, may be subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country and change from time to time. our failure, or the failure by our channel partners, to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. further, in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or u.s. regulations applicable to us. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, channel partners and agents have complied, or will comply, with these laws and policies. violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. if we are unable to successfully manage the challenges of international expansion and operations, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.as a cyber security provider, we are a target of cyber attacks that could adversely impact our reputation and operating results. we sell cyber security and data analytics products. as a result, we have been and will be a target of cyber attacks designed to impede the performance of our products, penetrate our network security or the security of our cloud platform or our internal systems, or that of our customers, misappropriate proprietary information and/or cause interruptions to our services. for example, because metasploit serves as an introduction to hacking for many individuals, a successful cyber attack on us may be perceived as a victory for a cyber attacker, thereby increasing the likelihood that we may be a target for attack even absent a financial motive. further, if our systems are breached, attackers could learn critical information about how our products operate to help protect our customers it infrastructures from cyber risk, thereby making our customers more vulnerable to cyber attacks. in addition, if actual or perceived breaches of our network security occur, they could adversely affect the market perception of our products, negatively affecting our reputation, and may expose us to the loss of our proprietary information or information belonging to our customers, investigations or litigation and possible liability, including injunctive relief and monetary damages. such security breaches could also divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. in addition, such security breaches could impair our ability to operate our business and provide products to our customers. if this happens, our reputation could be harmed, our revenue could decline and our business could suffer.we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key employees, as well as on our ability to successfully hire, train, manage and retain qualified personnel, especially those in sales and marketing and research and development. our future performance depends on the continued services and contributions of our senior management, particularly corey thomas, our president and chief executive officer, and other key employees to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. we maintain key man insurance on mr.thomas, but do not do so for any of our other executive officers or key employees. from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting from the termination or departure of our executive officers and key employees. our senior management and key employees are generally employed on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of the services of our senior management, particularly mr.thomas, or other key employees for any reason could significantly delay or prevent our development or the achievement of our strategic objectives and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 20 our ability to successfully pursue our growth strategy will also depend on our ability to attract, motivate and retain our personnel, especially those in sales and marketing and research and development. we face intense competition for these employees from numerous technology, software and other companies, especially in certain geographic areas in which we operate, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to attract, motivate and/or retain additional qualified employees in the future. if we are unable to attract new employees and retain our current employees, we may not be able to adequately develop and maintain new products or professional services or market our existing products or professional services at the same levels as our competitors and we may, therefore, lose customers and market share. our failure to attract and retain personnel, especially those in sales and marketing and research and development positions for which we have historically had a high turnover rate, could have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our business objectives and, as a result, our ability to compete could decrease, our operating results could suffer and our revenue could decrease. even if we are able to identify and recruit a sufficient number of new hires, these new hires will require significant training before they achieve full productivity and they may not become productive as quickly as we would like or at all.our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately manage our future growth, or are unable to scale our systems and processes, our operating results may be negatively affected. we are a rapidly growing company. to manage future growth effectively, and in connection with our transition to being a public company, we will need to continue to improve and expand our internal information technology systems, financial infrastructure, and operating and administrative systems and controls, which we may not be able to do efficiently, in a timely manner or at all. any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination across our organization. failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, harm our results of operations and lead to investors losing confidence in our internal systems and processes.our quarterly operating results may vary from period to period, which could result in our failure to meet expectations with respect to operating results and cause the trading price of our stock to decline. our operating results have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: the level of demand for our products and professional services; customer renewal rates; the extent to which customers purchase additional products, including content subscriptions and maintenance and support related to our nexpose, metasploit and appspider products, or professional services; the level of perceived threats to organizations cyber security; network outages, security breaches, technical difficulties or interruptions with our products; changes in the growth rate of the markets in which we compete; the announcement or adoption of new regulations and policy mandates or changes to existing regulations and policy mandates; the timing and success of new product or professional service introductions by us or our competitors or any other changes in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors; the introduction or adoption of new technologies that compete with our offerings; 21 the mix of our products and professional services sold during a period; decisions by potential customers to purchase cyber security products or services from other vendors; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; the timing of sales commissions relative to the recognition of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition generally; price competition; our ability to successfully manage any future acquisitions of businesses, including without limitation the timing of expenses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies; our ability to increase, retain and incentivize the channel partners that market and sell our products and professional services; our continued international

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS The shares of common stock offered by this prospectus involve a substantial risk of loss. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully read this entire prospectus and should give particular attention to the following risk factors. You should recognize that other significant risks may arise in the future, which we cannot foresee at this time. Also, the risks that we now foresee might affect us to a greater or different degree than expected. There are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements in this prospectus. These factors include, without limitation, the risk factors listed below and other factors presented throughout this prospectus. If our products fail in clinical studies, we will be unable to obtain FDA approval and will not be able to sell those productsTo achieve profitable operations, we must, alone or with others, successfully identify, develop, introduce and market proprietary products. Even if we identify potential products, we will have to conduct significant additional development activities and preclinical and clinical tests, and obtain regulatory approval before our products can be commercialized. Product candidates that may appear to be promising at early stages of development may not successfully reach the market for a number of reasons. We have not submitted any products for marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory bodyGenerally, all of our product candidates are in research or preclinical development, with only three, INS365 Respiratory, INS365 Ophthalmic and INS316 Diagnostic, currently in clinical trials. The results of preclinical and initial clinical testing of our products under development may not necessarily indicate the results that will be obtained from later or more extensive testing. Companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials. Our ongoing clinical studies might be delayed or halted for various reasons, including: . the drug is not effective, or physicians think that the drug is not effective; . patients experience severe side effects during treatment; . patients die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that may or may not relate to the drug being studied; . patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate we expect; . drug supplies are not sufficient to treat the patients in the studies; or . we decide to modify the drug during testing. Because our product candidates utilize a new mechanism of action, obtaining regulatory approval may be difficult, expensive and prolonged, which would delay any marketing of our productsWe cannot apply for regulatory approval to market a product candidate until we successfully complete pivotal clinical trials for the product. To complete successfully clinical trials, the products must meet the criteria for clinical approval, or endpoints, which we establish for the product in the clinical study. 7 Generally, we will establish these endpoints in consultation with the regulatory authorities, following design guidelines on the efficacy, safety and tolerability measures required for approval of productsBecause our existing product candidates utilize a new approach to the treatment of respiratory and eye diseases, we may have trouble establishing endpoints that the regulatory authorities agree sufficiently evaluate the effectiveness of each product candidate. For this and other reasons, we could encounter delays and increased expenses in our clinical trials if the regulatory authorities determine that the endpoints established for a clinical trial do not predict a clinical benefit, and the authorities will not approve the product for marketing without further clinical trials. The regulatory authorities could change their view on clinical trial design and the establishment of appropriate standards for efficacy, safety and tolerability and require a change in study design, additional data or even further clinical trials before approval of a product candidateAfter initial regulatory approval, regulatory authorities continue to review a marketed product and its manufacturer. They may require us to conduct long- term safety studies after approval. Discovery of previously unknown problems through adverse event reporting may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal from the market. Additionally, we and our officers and directors could be subject to civil and criminal penalties. If physicians and patients do not accept our product candidates, they may not be commercially successfulEven if regulatory authorities approve our product candidates, those products may not be commercially successful. Acceptance of and demand for our products will depend largely on the following factors: . acceptance by physicians and patients of our products as safe and effective therapies; . reimbursement of drug and treatment costs by third-party payors; . safety, effectiveness and pricing of alternative products; and . prevalence and severity of side effects associated with our productsIn addition, to achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates, in many cases we will need to develop, alone or with others, convenient methods for administering product candidates. Physicians have administered our current product candidates for the treatment or diagnosis of respiratory disorders, INS365 Respiratory and INS316 Diagnostic, using a jet nebulizer, a device that generates and delivers a fine mist derived from a liquid, which is inhaled into the lungs, in their respective clinical studies. Although the use of a jet nebulizer is an effective and well accepted means for administering products for inhalation with respect to acute use and, to a lesser degree, chronic use, we believe more convenient methods of delivery and administration, such as a hand-held inhalation device, will be necessary in the case of INS365 Respiratory, to more fully address chronic use. Although we have successfully completed a test of a prototype hand-held inhalation device in 12 healthy patients, our testing of such devices is at an early stage and we may not be able to develop or find a convenient hand-held device that works in patients with chronic bronchitis. Our current product candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease, INS365 Ophthalmic, is applied from a vial containing a single dose of medication. Patients may prefer to purchase the medication in a bottle containing a sufficient quantity of medication for multiple doses. We have not yet established a plan to develop a multi-dose formulation. Similar challenges exist in identifying and perfecting convenient methods of administration for many of our other product candidates. 8 We intend to rely on third parties to develop, market, distribute and sell our product candidates and those third parties may not performWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical studies, obtain regulatory approvals, market, distribute or sell our products and intend to rely on experienced third parties to perform, or assist us in the performance of, all of those functions. We may not identify acceptable partners or enter into favorable agreements with them. If third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we will be unable to obtain required governmental marketing approvals and will be unable to sell our products. Our dependence on collaborative relationships may lead to delays in product development and disputes over rights to technologyOur business strategy depends upon the formation of research collaborations, licensing and/or marketing arrangements. We currently have development collaborations with three collaborators, Genentech, Kissei and Santen. The termination of any collaboration may lead to delays in product development and disputes over technology rights and may reduce our ability to enter into collaborations with other potential partners. Genentech has the right, by giving us 150 days prior notice, to terminate our collaboration. If we do not maintain the Genentech, Kissei or Santen collaborations or establish additional research and development collaborations or licensing arrangements it will be difficult to develop and commercialize therapeutic or diagnostic products using our technology. Any future collaborations or licensing arrangements may not be on terms favorable to us. Our current or any future collaborations or licensing arrangements ultimately may not be successful. Under our current strategy, and for the foreseeable future, we do not expect to develop or market therapeutic or diagnostic products on our own. As a result, we will continue to depend on collaborators and contractors for the preclinical study and clinical development of therapeutic products and for regulatory approval, manufacturing and marketing of therapeutic and diagnostic products which result from our technology. The agreements with collaborators typically will allow them some discretion in electing whether to pursue such activities. If any collaborator were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct collaborative activities in a timely and successful manner, the preclinical or clinical development or commercialization of product candidates or research programs would be delayed or terminated. Any delay or termination in clinical development or commercialization would delay or eliminate potential products revenues relating to our research programsWe intend to rely on Genentech, Kissei, Santen and any future collaborators for significant funding in support of our development efforts. If Genentech, Kissei or Santen reduces or terminates its funding, we will need to devote additional internal resources to product development, scale back or terminate certain research and development programs or seek alternative collaborators. See "Risk Factors--If we are not able to obtain sufficient additional funding to meet our expanding capital requirements, we may be forced to reduce or eliminate research programs and product development" and "Business--Corporate Collaborations." Disputes may arise in the future over the ownership of rights to any technology developed with collaborators. These and other possible disagreements between us and our collaborators could lead to delays in the collaborative development or commercialization of therapeutic or diagnostic products. Such disagreement could also result in litigation or require arbitration to resolve. 9 If we are unable to contract with third parties for synthesis and manufacturing of product candidates for preclinical testing and clinical trials and for large scale manufacturing of any of our drug candidates, we may be unable to develop or commercialize productsWe have no experience or capabilities in large scale commercial manufacturing of any of our product candidates or any experience or capabilities in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products generally. We do not generally expect to engage directly in the manufacturing of products, but instead intend to contract with others for these services. We have relied upon supply agreements with third parties for the manufacture and supply of our product candidates for purposes of preclinical testing and clinical trials. Although we have previously received preclinical and clinical supplies of our product candidates from several suppliers, we presently depend upon Yamasa Corporation as the sole supplier for our supply of product candidates. If we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturing on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize products as planned. Our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks: . the manufacturing processes for most of our product candidates have not been tested in quantities needed for commercial sales; . delays in scale-up to commercial quantities and any change to a manufacturer other than Yamasa Corporation could delay clinical studies, regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products; . manufacturers of our products are subject to the FDA's good manufacturing practices regulations and similar foreign standards, and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by the third-party manufacturers; . if we need to change to manufacturers other than Yamasa Corporation, FDA and comparable foreign regulators would require new testing and compliance inspections and the new manufacturers would have to be educated in the processes necessary for the production of our product candidates; . without satisfactory long-term agreements with manufacturers, we will not be able to develop or commercialize our product candidates as planned or at all; and . we may not have intellectual property rights, or may have to share intellectual property rights, to any improvements in the manufacturing processes or new manufacturing processes for our product candidates. If we are unable to supply Kissei and Santen with sufficient quantities of materials we may breach our agreements with such partiesWe are currently a party to a development, license and supply agreement with each of Kissei and Santen, under which we granted each a license to develop and market INS365 Respiratory and INS365 Ophthalmic, respectively. See "Business-- Corporate Collaborations." Generally, the agreements with Kissei and Santen will require us to supply such partners with either sufficient quantities of materials or finished products, as applicable, for the purpose of commercial distribution. We will need to establish, alone or with third parties, a manufacturing process in relation to each product. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of products may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basisOur inability to successfully manufacture commercial products could result in our breach of the terms of our agreements with Kissei and Santen. Any of these factors could delay our preclinical studies, clinical trials or commercialization of our product candidates, entail higher costs and result in our inability to effectively sell our product candidates. 10 If our patent protection is inadequate, the development and any possible sales of our product candidates could suffer or competitors could force our products completely out of the marketOur business and competitive position depends upon our ability to continue to develop and protect our products and processes, proprietary methods and technology. Except for one patent covering new chemical compounds, most of our patents are use patents containing claims covering methods of treating disorders and diseases by administering therapeutic chemical compounds. Use patents, while providing adequate protection for commercial efforts in the United States, may afford a lesser degree of protection in European and possibly other countries due to their particular patent laws. Besides our use patents, we have patents covering pharmaceutical formulations of these chemical compounds. We also have patent applications covering processes for large-scale manufacturing of these chemical compounds. Many of the chemical compounds included in the claims of our use patents, formulation patents and process applications were known in the scientific community prior to our formation. None of our patents cover these previously known chemical compounds themselves, which are in the public domain. As a result, competitors may be able to commercialize products that use the same chemical compounds used by us for the treatment of disorders and diseases not covered by our use patents. In such a case, physicians, pharmacies and wholesalers could possibly substitute these products for our products. Such substitution would reduce any revenues received from the sale of our productsWe believe that there may be significant litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. A patent does not provide the patent holder with freedom to operate in a way that infringes the patent rights of others. While we are not aware of any patent that we are infringing, nor have we been accused of infringement by any other party, other companies currently have or may acquire patent rights which we might be accused of infringing. If we must defend a patent suit, or if we choose to initiate a suit to have a third party patent declared invalid, we may need to make considerable expenditures of money and management time in litigation. A judgement against us in a patent infringement action could cause us to pay monetary damages, require us to obtain licenses, or prevent us from manufacturing or marketing the affected products. In addition, we may need to initiate litigation to enforce our proprietary rights against others, or we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to determine the priority of invention of any of our technologiesIn general, the development of patent rights in pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products to a degree sufficient to support commercial efforts in these areas is typically uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. For instance, while the USPTO has recently issued guidelines addressing the requirements for demonstrating utility for biotechnology inventions, USPTO examiners may not follow these guidelines in examining patent applications. Such applications may have to be appealed to the USPTO's Appeals Board for a final determination of patentability. If we fail to reach milestone or other obligations, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and other licensors may terminate our agreements with themOur current technologies, discoveries and our original patents are based in part on two exclusive licenses and one non-exclusive license from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. See "Business--Patents and Proprietary Rights." Generally, if we fail to meet milestones under the respective UNC licenses, UNC may terminate the applicable license. In addition, it may be necessary in the future for us to obtain additional licenses from UNC or other third parties to develop future commercial opportunities or to avoid infringement of third party patents. We do not know the terms on which such licenses may be available, if at all. 11 Failure to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies may reduce or eliminate our ability to develop product candidates. Even if we acquire all necessary licenses, if we breach any license provision, either intentionally or unintentionally, we may lose our right to continued use of the licensed technology. Because we rely upon trade secrets and agreements to protect some of our intellectual property there is a risk that unauthorized parties may obtain and use information that we regard as proprietaryWe rely upon the laws of trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary compounds, methods, processes, formulations and other information for which we are not seeking patent protection. We have taken security measures to protect our proprietary technologies, processes, information systems and data, and we continue to explore ways to further enhance security. However, despite these efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Employees, academic collaborators and consultants with whom we have entered confidentiality and/or non-disclosure agreements, may improperly disclose our proprietary information. In addition, competitors may, through a variety of proper means, independently develop substantially the equivalent of our proprietary information and technologies, gain access to our trade secrets, or properly design around any of our patented technologies. Because all of our product candidates use related mechanisms of action, we may not be able to commercialize our products if the mechanism of action is not effectiveAny products resulting from our product development efforts are not expected to be available for sale for a number of years, if at all. Two of our product candidates, INS365 Respiratory and INS37217 Respiratory, operate in a similar manner. If the clinical results of one of the compounds is not favorable, the results of the other compound may not be favorable. Moreover, we have designed all of our product candidates to use related mechanisms of action. If these mechanisms of action are not effective, we may not be able to commercialize any of our product candidates. Even if all of our product candidates prove effective, we may choose not to commercialize all of them. If we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than anticipated, or in an amount greater than anticipated, we may be unable to continue our operationsWe have experienced significant losses since inception. We incurred net losses of $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000, $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 and $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. As of March 31, 2000, our accumulated deficit was approximately $35.8 million. We expect to incur significant additional operating losses over the next several years and expect cumulative losses to increase substantially in the near term due to expanded research and development efforts, preclinical studies and clinical trials. We expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial. Such fluctuations will be affected by the following: .timing of regulatory approvals and commercial sales of our product candidates; .the level of patient demand for our products; .timing of payments to and from licensors and corporate partners; and .timing of investments in new technologies. 12 No regulatory authorities have approved any of our product candidates for marketing, and therefore, we are not generating any revenues from product sales. To achieve and sustain profitable operations, we must, alone or with others, develop successfully, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, introduce, market and sell our products. The time frame necessary to achieve market success is long and uncertain. We do not expect to generate product revenues for at least the next few years. We may not generate sufficient product revenues to become profitable or to sustain profitability. If the time required to achieve profitability is longer than we anticipate, we may not be able to continue our business. If we are not able to obtain sufficient additional funding to meet our expanding capital requirements, we may be forced to reduce or eliminate research programs and product developmentWe have used substantial amounts of cash to fund our research and development activities. In 1999, our operating expenses exceeded $9.0 million. We expect our capital and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our research and development activities, address possible difficulties with clinical studies and prepare for commercial sales. Many factors will influence our future capital needs. These factors include: . the progress of our research programs; . the number and breadth of these programs; . our ability to attract collaborators for our products; . achievement of milestones under our existing collaborations with Genentech, Kissei and Santen; . our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations; . progress by our collaborators: Genentech, Kissei and Santen; . the level of our activities relating to commercialization rights we retain in our collaborations; . competing technological and market developments; . the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and . the costs and timing of regulatory approvalsWe anticipate that our operating expenses will exceed $20.0 million over the next twelve months. We also expect to purchase capital equipment at a cost of approximately $1.0 million. Following the twelve month period, we expect our operating expenses to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates. We intend to rely on Genentech, Kissei, Santen, future collaborators and the proceeds of this offering for significant funding in support of our development efforts. In addition, we may seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings and debt financings. Additional financing may not be available when needed. If available, such financing may not be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Stockholders' ownership will be diluted if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may have to give up rights to our technologies or product candidates which are involved in these future collaborations and arrangements or grant licenses on unfavorable terms. If adequate funds are not available, we would have to scale back or terminate research programs and product development. As of June 23, 2000, we had cash on hand of approximately $18.0 million. 13 We may not be able to successfully compete with biotechnology companies and established pharmaceutical companiesThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors in the United States and elsewhere are numerous and include, among others, major multinational pharmaceutical and chemical companies, specialized biotechnology firms and universities and other research institutions. These competitors include Abbott, Astra Zeneca, Aventis, Boehringer Ingelheim, Glaxo Wellcome, Pfizer and SmithKline Beecham. Many of these competitors employ greater financial and other resources, including larger research and development staffs and more effective marketing and manufacturing organizations, than we or our collaborative partners. Acquisitions of competing companies and potential competitors by large pharmaceutical companies or others could enhance financial, marketing and other resources available to such competitors. As a result of academic and government institutions becoming increasingly aware of the commercial value of their research findings, such institutions are more likely to enter into exclusive licensing agreements with commercial enterprises, including our competitors, to market commercial products. Our competitors may develop technologies and drugs that are safer, more effective or less costly than any which we are developing or which would render our technology and future drugs obsolete and non-competitive. The products of our competitors marketed to treat chronic bronchitis include anti-inflammatory products, such as Azmacort(R) and Beclovent(R), bronchodilators such as Atrovent(R) and Proventil(R), and antibiotics such as Biaxin(R) and Zithromax(R). Pulmozyme(R), a Genentech product, and TOBI(R) from PathoGenesis are examples of products used to treat cystic fibrosis. The main current treatments for dry eye disease involve artificial tear replacement drops. In addition, alternative approaches to treating diseases which we have targeted, such as gene therapy, may make our product candidates obsolete. Our competitors may also be more successful in production and marketing. See "Business-- Competition" for a discussion of competitors and the advantages of their productsIn addition, some of our competitors have greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical and clinical trials and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we do. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before we do may achieve a significant competitive advantage, including patent and FDA marketing exclusivity rights that would delay our ability to market products. Drugs resulting from our research and development efforts, or from our joint efforts with our collaborative partners may not compete successfully with competitors' existing products or products under development. Failure to hire and retain key personnel may hinder our product development programs and our business development effortsWe depend on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, including Christy L. Shaffer, Ph.D., our President, Chief Executive Officer and director; and Gregory J. Mossinghoff, our Chief Business Officer. If any of these people leaves us, we may have difficulties conducting our operations. We have not entered into agreements with any of the above principal members of our management and scientific staff that bind any of them to a specific period of employment. We do not maintain key person life insurance. Our future success also will depend in part on our ability to attract, hire and retain additional personnel skilled or experienced in the pharmaceutical industry. There is intense competition for such qualified personnel. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel. 14 Our operations involve a risk of injury from hazardous materials, which could be very expensive to usOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. If such an accident were to occur, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and waste products. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial. Use of our products may result in product liability claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverageClinical trials or manufacturing, marketing and sale of our potential products by our collaborative partners may expose us to liability claims from the use of those products. Although we carry clinical trial liability insurance, we currently do not carry product liability insurance. We or our collaborators may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient or even any insurance. If we can, it may not be at a reasonable cost. If we cannot or are unable otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims, we may find it difficult or impossible to commercialize pharmaceutical products we or our collaborators develop. If claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage, we may go out of business. If third party payors will not provide coverage or reimburse patients for any products we develop, our ability to derive revenues will sufferOur success will depend in part on the extent to which government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third party payors will pay for our products. Reimbursement for newly approved health care products is uncertain. In the United States and elsewhere, third party payors, such as Medicare, are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products. In the United States, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system have been proposed in recent years. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has and will continue to increase pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. While we cannot predict whether legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or what effect those proposals or managed care efforts, including those relating to Medicare payments, may have on our business, the announcement and/or adoption of such proposals or efforts could increase our costs and reduce or eliminate profit margins. Third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any products we discover or develop. If government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products, the market acceptance of these products may be reduced.

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all of the other information included in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus, before investing in our common stock. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially adversely affected. as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our business and industry demand for our products is affected by general economic conditions, including our customers industries and capital expenditures, consumer spending trends and other macroeconomic conditions. our business is affected by general economic conditions. any uncertainty or adverse changes such as turmoil in global economic and political conditions, including through rising interest rates or inflation, commodity prices, high unemployment, increased volatility in global capital markets, international conflicts, sovereign debt concerns and/or other factors beyond our control, could lead to a significant decline in demand for our products. in addition, the success of our business depends on the profitability of our customers businesses. many of our customers are in businesses that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as the packaging, automotive, industrial components and machinery, construction, consumer durables, electronics, medical and other industries. the performance of our business is directly related to the production levels of our customers. in particular, prices for plastic resins used to make plastic products and parts tend to fluctuate to a greater degree than our customers can adjust for in the pricing of their products. when resin prices increase, our customers profit margins decrease, which may result in lower demand for our products. therefore, our business is affected by fluctuations in the price of resin, which could have an adverse effect on our business and ability to generate operating cash flows. in addition, deterioration in the credit quality of our customers or the estimated residual value of our equipment could negatively impact the ability of our customers to obtain the resources they need to make purchases of our equipment. if our customers cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products and services as a result of the economy or other factors, our business could suffer. moreover, any prolonged periods of decline in our customers capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.if the use of plastic declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. approximately 89% of our 2014 sales and profits were realized from the sale of equipment and services to the plastic processing market. a reduction in the usage of plastic would likely result in the reduction of our sales of equipment and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. factors that could result in a decline in the usage of plastic include: the relative cost of plastic compared with other materials, such as glass, metal and paper. the principal cost of plastic is petroleum-based resins and fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas typically impact the price of these resins. if the price of plastic resins were to increase substantially or the cost associated with other competing materials such as glass, metal and paper, were to materially decrease, the plastic products of our customers may no longer be economically competitive relative to other alternatives. the environmental impact of plastic may be perceived negatively by environmental groups, customers and government regulators. a number of governmental authorities and advocacy groups 20 have lobbied for and considered, or are expected to consider, legislation aimed at addressing the environmental impacts of plastic. these proposals have included mandating certain rates of recycling and/or the use of recycled materials, imposing deposits or taxes on plastic packaging material, requiring retailers or manufacturers to develop a recycling infrastructure and increased scrutiny on the use of plastic. legislative and other changes aimed at reducing the environmental impact of plastic may result in increased costs associated with plastic and/or reduced demand for plastic. any of the foregoing factors and other factors, including those unknown to us, could result in a decline in the usage of plastic and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.we operate in highly competitive industries, many of which are currently subject to intense price competition, and if we are unable to compete successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. many of the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. our products may not compete successfully with those of our competitors. the markets for plastic processing equipment and related products, mold components and metalworking fluids are highly competitive and include a number of north american, european and asian competitors. principal competitive factors in the plastic processing industry include price, product features, technology, performance, reliability, quality, delivery and customer service. principal competitive factors in the mold components industry include technology, price, quality, performance and delivery. principal competitive factors in the metalworking industrial fluids industry include price, market coverage, technology, performance, delivery and customer service. our competitors may be positioned to offer more favorable pricing to customers, resulting in reduced profitability and a loss of market share for us. in certain cases we have lost business to competitors who offered prices lower than ours. competition may also limit our ability to pass on the effects of increases in our cost structure. in addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial resources and less debt than we do, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage in the future. these competitors may be better able to withstand and respond to changes in conditions within our industry. additionally, due to the recent strength of the u.s. dollar, some of our european competitors may be able to offer prices lower than ours. competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings and/or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes, reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing, distributing and selling our products.our results also depend on the successful implementation of several additional strategic initiatives. we may not be able to implement these strategies successfully, on a timely basis, or at all. we have recently implemented or begun to implement several strategic initiatives that are designed to increase our cost savings and revenue, transform our business and improve our performance. these initiatives include expanding low cost production capabilities and consolidation of facilities, continued back-office integration to a shared service center and implementation of lean sourcing initiatives. the success of our recent initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent difficulty associated with implementing these initiatives, and is largely dependent on the skills, experience, and efforts of our management and other employees. we face a number of uncertainties in connection with the successful implementation of these strategic initiatives. as a result, we may not be successful in implementing these initiatives nor realize anticipated cost savings and increases in revenue. if we are unsuccessful in implementing these initiatives, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. increases in our cost structure or disruption in our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly for raw materials and purchased components used in our business, including the cost of labor and steel and the cost of oil and chemicals used in the production of metalworking fluids. our success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and global sourcing actions. while we have historically responded by reducing our cost structure and increasing the prices we charge our customers, these measures may not always be sufficient to offset the effects of the cost increases we experience. accordingly, market changes in raw material and purchased component prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. additionally, we have developed a network of third-party vendors who supply certain parts and components for our products. while we currently believe that these third-party vendors represent a low-cost source of supply, their costs could rise in the future and we may not be able to effectively source or produce these components and parts. significant disruptions to our supply chain could limit our ability to source parts and components on a cost effective basis, if at all, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.our significant international operations subject us to risks such as unfavorable political, regulatory, labor and tax conditions. our business is subject to risks related to the different legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. we have operations in many foreign countries, including, but not limited to, countries in europe and asia. for the year ended december31, 2014, markets outside north america represented the following percentages of our sales: asia 22%; europe 21%; and the rest of the world 5%. in addition, as of december31, 2014, approximately 68% of our workforce was located outside the united states. additional risks associated with our international operations include, but are not limited to the following: agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign countrys legal system; foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, attempt to impose transfer taxes on past or future corporate level transactions, impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls; general economic and political conditions or instability in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes or withholding obligations; differing, and possibly more stringent, labor regulations; natural disasters, pandemics or international conflict, including terrorist acts, could interrupt the manufacturing of our products or performance of services, endanger our personnel or cause delays; enforcement of anti-bribery laws, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended, (the fcpa), the u.k. bribery act (the ukba) and similar laws, economic sanctions laws, regulations and regimes (including those administered by the office of foreign assets control (ofac) of the u.s. department of the treasury), and other international laws and regulations; 22 the difficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations; less protective foreign intellectual property laws; unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur; longer customer payment cycles; and legal systems that may be less developed and less predictable than those in the united states. we are also subject to numerous regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including customs and international trade laws, export control, antitrust laws and zoning and occupancy laws that regulate producers generally and/or govern the importation, exportation, promotion and sale of our products, the operation of facilities and our relationships with our customers, suppliers and competitors. if these regulations or laws were to change or were violated by our management, employees, suppliers, or agents, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subjected to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, any of which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business and results of operations. in addition, changes in national and local minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs, which could negatively impact our profitability. our overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing and unpredictable legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. we may not be able to continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in each foreign market where we do business. any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate cash flow and grow our business.our operations partly depend on the rate of economic development and growth in the emerging markets of asia, africa, central america and south america. our operations partly depend upon the economies of the asian, african, central american and south american markets. these markets include countries with economies in various stages of development or structural reform, some of which are subject to rapid fluctuations in terms of consumer prices, employment levels, gross domestic product, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. our operations in these markets may also be subject to risks relating to weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights, exchange controls, unstable governments and privatization, changes in customs or tax regimes, or other government actions affect the flow of goods and currency. to the extent such fluctuations and risks have an effect on the ability of our consumers to pay for our products, the growth of sales of our products in such markets could be impacted negatively.our operations are conducted worldwide and our results of operations are subject to currency translation risk and currency transaction risk that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. since significant sales are made in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our financial results are affected by currency fluctuations. the financial condition and results of operations of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to u.s. dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. exchange rates between these currencies, including the canadian dollar, the euro, chinese yuan renminbi, indian rupee and u.s. dollars in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. for the year ended december31, 2014, approximately 45% of our sales were in currency other than u.s. dollars. significant changes in the value of the euro, chinese yuan renminbi and indian rupee relative to the 23 u.s. dollar could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. if the euro, chinese yuan renminbi or indian rupee should weaken against the u.s. dollar in the future, we will experience a negative effect in translating our new orders, sales and earnings when compared to historical results. in addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it records revenues. see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsquantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskforeign currency exchange rate risk. given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and translation risks and any volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.we might not be able to timely develop, manufacture and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business. our success in the future will depend in part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities, develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes of our competitors in a cost-effective and timely manner. difficulties or delays in identifying viable new products, research, development or production of new products or failure to gain regulatory approval, intellectual property protection or market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. our competitors may develop other patent technologies that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies or render our technologies or services less competitive or obsolete. our inability to anticipate, respond to or utilize changing technologies could cause us to lose customers.our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by business disruptions, security threats and security breaches. business disruptions, including supply disruptions, increasing costs for energy, temporary plant and/or power outages and network disruptions, could harm our operations as well as the operations of our customers, distributors or suppliers. in addition, the operation of our business relies on information technology (it) infrastructure and systems on multiple platforms to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to support a variety of business processes and activities. we face security threats and risks of security breaches to our facilities, data and it infrastructure. although it is impossible to predict the occurrence or consequences of business disruptions, security threats or security breaches, they could harm our reputation, subject us to material liabilities, result in reduced demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products to our customers or distributors or to receive raw materials from suppliers, compromise our networks, subject us to liability or regulatory penalty under laws protecting the privacy of personal information and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. further, the failure of our systems to perform could severely disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations. our systems are also vulnerable to natural or man-made disasters, computer viruses or hackers, power loss or other technology system failures. we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which could harm our future success and competitive position. our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products. we may not always be successful in preventing the unauthorized use of our existing intellectual property rights by our competitors. we may not be able to discover unauthorized use of our proprietary technologies in the future or be able to receive any payments therefor. if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property, it may result in the loss of valuable 24 technologies or require us to make payments to other companies for infringing on their intellectual property rights. we generally rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws as well as confidentiality agreements with other parties to protect our technologies; however, some of our technologies may not be protected. confidentiality agreements may be breached or terminated, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. additionally, third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property rights. litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts. further, we might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm our business and could result in us having to obtain a license to sell our products or pay substantial royalties. our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we have applied for patent protection relating to certain existing and proposed products, processes and services. while we generally apply for patents in those countries where we intend to make, have made, use, or sell patented products, we may not accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable. if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. the patents issued as a result of our foreign patent applications may not have the same scope of coverage as our u.s. patents. further, competitors may infringe on our patents and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our patents. we may also have any of the following occur: any of our patents could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged; any of our pending or future patent applications could fail to be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all, and patents issued from such applications may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage; others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies or design around our patents; or steps taken by us to protect our technologies may not prevent misappropriation of such technologies. we also own or have rights to various trademark registrations and trademark registration applications in the united states and certain international jurisdictions that we use in connection with our business. monitoring unauthorized use of our trademarks is difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our trademark rights in all jurisdictions, particularly in countries whose laws do not grant the same protections as the united states grants.our financial results are impacted by unpredictable customer purchasing trends and the timing of converting orders into sales can lead to variations in, and uncertainties regarding, our financial results from period to period. sales of our plastic processing machinery products are subject to customer buying patterns and can vary from period to period. we sometimes have sales to customers that are large relative to our sales in any given period. fluctuations in demand for our plastic processing machinery products due to large unpredictable sales to customers and delays or failures to fulfill purchase orders could lead to variations in, and uncertainties regarding, our financial results from period to period. in addition, our plastic processing machinery sales are impacted by the timing of orders and the length of time required to convert these unshipped orders, or backlog, into sales, which varies based on the type of customer and product and can range from several weeks to several months. our inability to satisfy orders on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and the conversion of our backlog and open orders into revenue may occur at a slower rate than historical trends. our backlog as of march 31, 2015 was $241.4 million. this backlog is based upon anticipated sales revenue from confirmed orders. the majority of our plastic processing machinery products are produced after a price has been agreed to, an order has been received and a deposit has been paid by our customers and generally require delivery within a specified period of time. if we are unsuccessful in recruiting skilled labor, experience delays in purchase component deliveries or experience changes in customer specifications on ordered equipment, the rate at which backlog or open orders are converted into revenue may be slower than we have historically experienced. if it takes longer than expected to realize revenue, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. additionally, any failure to deliver products on a timely basis could result in our customers cancelling their orders, requesting discounts or ceasing to do business with us altogether. furthermore, the portion of our backlog that may be produced in our foreign subsidiaries is exposed to fluctuations in the applicable foreign currencies, which may be material. the historical relationship of backlog to sales revenues actually realized by us, should not be considered indicative of future results. see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of milacronnew orders and backlog.our operations depend on our ability to maintain production at our facilities. our operations may be subject to disruption due to extreme weather conditions, floods, fire, natural disaster, war, terrorist activity, sustained mechanical failure and similar events, major industrial accidents, strikes and lockouts, new laws or regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations or changes in governmental enforcement policies, regulatory actions and other events. any disruption resulting from any of these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and we may not have insurance to adequately compensate us. our facilities and the manufacturing equipment located in our facilities would be difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time. furthermore, due to the concentration of our operations, a closure of one of our manufacturing facilities could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations. our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any prolonged interruption of all or a substantial portion of our business.if our products fail to perform or fail to meet customer requirements or expectations, we could incur significant additional costs. the production of some of our products involves highly complex processes. our customers specify quality, performance and reliability standards that we must meet. if our products do not meet these standards, we may be required to replace or rework the products. in some cases, our products may contain undetected defects or flaws that only become evident after shipment. in the past, we have proactively replaced parts in the field that have experienced a high rate of failure. we also may be the target of product liability lawsuits. if a person were to bring a product liability suit against one of our customers, this customer may attempt to seek contribution from us. a person may also bring a product liability claim directly against us. a successful product liability claim or series of claims against us in excess of our insurance coverage for payments, for which we are not otherwise indemnified, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, in the event a significant product or service claim arises. a significant product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of customer confidence in our products. we could be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. from time to time we are a defendant in or otherwise a party to certain lawsuits and other proceedings that result from, and are incidental to, the conduct of our business. these suits and proceedings may concern issues including product liability, employment, antitrust, warranty and contractual disputes, environmental matters, and intellectual property matters. in addition, various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such as a final adverse judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on us. while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending or future suits, claims and proceedings, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.our business depends on attracting and retaining qualified management personnel. the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. given our relative size and the breadth of our global operations, there are a limited number of qualified management personnel to assume the responsibilities of management level employees should there be management turnover. our success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees, including members of senior management. the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects. in addition, because of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance depends on the continued service of, and our ability to attract and retain, qualified management, commercial and technical personnel. competition for such personnel is intense, and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign. failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our growth and operational initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability.our operations may subject us to potential responsibilities and costs under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. our operations are subject to environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements in the united states and abroad relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air, soil and water, the management, treatment, storage and disposal of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous substances and wastes, the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites and the protection of employee health and safety. environmental, health and safety regulations and standards are becoming increasingly strict, which could require us to make potentially significant capital or operating expenditures to comply with such standards. in addition, we could incur significant costs, including fines and sanctions, and claims by third parties for property damage and personal inj</td>

set forth in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, before deciding to invest in our common stock. if any of the events or developments described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. in that case, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our business we have a history of net losses, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. we have a history of significant net losses and a limited history commercializing our molecular diagnostic products. we obtained fda clearance for our first generation molecular diagnostic system in 2006, and commenced a limited marketing effort for this system. we commenced offering our xt-8 instrument and our warfarin sensitivity test in july 2008. we commenced offering our cystic fibrosis genotyping test in july 2009 and our thrombophilia risk test in april 2010. our respiratory viral panel test is currently labeled for iuo. our net losses from continuing operations were approximately $4.8million for the three months ended march 31, 2010, $20.0million in 2009 and $28.4 million in 2008. at march31, 2010, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $131.0 million. we will continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future for our sales and marketing, research and development and regulatory activities and maintaining our existing and obtaining additional intellectual property rights. we can not provide you any assurance that we will ever achieve profitability and, even if we achieve profitability, that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. further, because of our limited commercialization history and because the market for molecular diagnostic products is relatively new and rapidly evolving, we have limited insight into the trends that may emerge and affect our business. we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business and financial condition.we are reliant on the commercial success of our xt-8 system and our diagnostic tests. through march 31, 2010, we had primarily placed our xt-8 instruments with customers at no initial charge through reagent rental agreements, under which customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of test cartridges over a period of one to three years. while we also offer our xt-8 instruments for sale, through march 31, 2010, we had sold only two of our instruments. we expect sales of our diagnostic tests associated with our xt-8 instrument will account for the vast majority of our revenues for at least the next several years. we intend to dedicate a significant portion of our resources to the commercialization of our xt-8 instrument and our existing fda-cleared diagnostic tests. although we intend to develop a broad range of additional diagnostic tests for use with the xt-8 system and our next-generation ad-8 system, we can not assure you when or if we will obtain fda clearances for the tests we intend to develop in the future, or whether the market will accept such new products. as a result, to the extent that our xt-8 system and our existing fda-cleared diagnostic tests are not commercially successful or are withdrawn from the market for any reason, our revenues will be adversely impacted and our business operating results and financial condition will be harmed.we may fail to successfully expand the menu of diagnostic tests for our xt-8 system, or effectively predict the types of tests our existing and target customers want. we currently market three fda-cleared diagnostic tests and have developed one other diagnostic test currently labeled for iuo. in addition, we have eight diagnostic tests in the development or design stage. some hospital-based and reference laboratories may not consider adopting our xt-8 system until we offer a broader menu of diagnostic tests. although we are developing additional tests to respond to the 9 needs of these laboratories, we can not guarantee that we will be able to license the appropriate technology, or develop and obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals, for enough additional tests quickly enough or in a manner that is cost-effective. the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends, as well as precise technological execution. in addition, in order to commercialize our products, we are required to undertake time consuming and costly development activities, including clinical studies for which the outcome is uncertain. products that appear promising during early development and preclinical studies may, nonetheless, fail to demonstrate the results needed to support regulatory approval or, if approved, may not generate the demand we expect. if we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize additional diagnostic tests for use with our xt-8 instrument, our revenues and our ability to achieve profitability will be impaired.our financial results will depend on the acceptance among reference laboratories and hospitals, third-party payors and the medical community of our molecular diagnostic technology and products. our future success depends on the acceptance by our target customers, third-party payors and the medical community that our molecular diagnostic products are a reliable, accurate and cost-effective replacement for other molecular diagnostic testing methods. physician offices and many hospitals outsource their molecular diagnostic testing needs to national or regional reference laboratories. our business success depends on our ability to convince our target reference laboratories and hospitals to replace their current testing methods with our xt-8 system and related diagnostic tests and increase usage of our new tests on installed systems. many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of our molecular diagnostic technology and products, including: our ability to convince our potential customers of the advantages and economic value of our diagnostic systems and tests over competing technologies and products; the relative convenience and ease of testing of our diagnostic systems over competing products; the introduction of new technologies and competing products that may make our technologies and products a less attractive solution for our target customers; the breadth of our menu of available diagnostic tests relative to our competitors; our success in training reference and hospital-based laboratories on the proper use of our products; the willingness of third-party payors to reimburse laboratories that use our diagnostic systems and tests; the acceptance in the medical community of our molecular diagnostic technology and products; the extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts; and general economic conditions.providing xt-8 instruments to our customers through reagent rental agreements may adversely affect our liquidity. we primarily place our xt-8 instruments with customers at no direct charge through reagent rental agreements, under which customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of test cartridges over a period of one to three years. while we also offer our xt-8 instruments for sale, through march 31, 2010, we had sold only two instruments and the amount of additional capital we may need to raise depends on the amount of our revenues from sales of test cartridges sold through these reagent rental agreements. we do not currently sell enough test cartridges to recover all of our fixed manufacturing expenses associated with the production of our instruments and test cartridges and therefore we currently 10 have a high cost of sales relative to revenue, resulting in a gross loss. if we continue not to sell a sufficient number of test cartridges to offset our expenses associated with these reagent rental agreements, our liquidity will be adversely affected.we have limited experience in sales and marketing and may be unable to successfully commercialize our xt-8 system and related diagnostic tests. we have limited marketing, sales and distribution experience and capabilities. in connection with our xt-8 system, we commenced offering our warfarin sensitivity test in july 2008, our cystic fibrosis genotyping test in july 2009 and our thrombophilia risk test in april 2010. as of march 31, 2010, we had 35 instruments actively in use with customers. we recently adjusted our sales strategy by terminating our relationship with a third-party distributor and beginning to build our own direct sales force. our ability to achieve profitability depends on attracting customers for the xt-8 system and building brand loyalty. to successfully perform sales, marketing, distribution and customer support functions ourselves, we will face a number of risks, including: our ability to attract and retain the skilled support team, marketing staff and sales force necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for our technology and our products; the ability of our sales and marketing team to identify and penetrate the potential customer base, including hospitals and national and regional reference laboratories; and the difficulty of establishing brand recognition and loyalty for our products. in addition, we may seek to enlist one or more third parties to assist with sales, distribution and customer support globally or in certain regions of the world. if we do seek to enter into these arrangements, we may not be successful in attracting desirable sales and distribution partners, or we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. if our sales and marketing efforts, or those of any third-party sales and distribution partners, are not successful, our technologies and products may not gain market acceptance, which would materially impact our business operations.we may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls. our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. these factors include: the expenses we incur in connection with commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution; the expenses we incur in licensing biomarkers from third parties to expand the menu of diagnostics tests we plan to offer; our sales strategy and whether the revenues from sales of our test cartridges or xt-8 instrument will be sufficient to offset our expenses; the time and resources required to develop, conduct clinical studies and obtain regulatory clearances for the additional diagnostic tests we develop; the expenses we incur for research and development required to maintain and improve our technology, including developing our next-generation molecular diagnostic system; the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation. 11 our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues from sales of our xt-8 system and diagnostic tests. we may be unable to reduce our expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenue. accordingly, a significant shortfall in demand for our products could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.we face intense competition from established and new companies in the molecular diagnostics field and expect to face increased competition in the future. we compete with companies that design, manufacture and market already-existing and new molecular diagnostics systems and tests. these competitors include: companies developing and marketing multiplex molecular diagnostics systems, such as luminex corporation and nanosphere, inc.; large hospital-based laboratories and reference laboratories who provide large-scale testing using their own proprietary testing methods; and healthcare companies that manufacture laboratory-based tests and analyzers, such as roche diagnostics and qiagen nv. we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies and our competitors improve their current products and expand their menu of diagnostic tests. one or more of our competitors may offer technology superior to ours and render our technology or our current products obsolete, unattractive or uneconomical. most of our current competitors, as well as many of our potential competitors, have greater name recognition, more substantial intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources to invest in new technologies, more substantial experience in new product development, greater regulatory expertise, more extensive manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers. if we are not able to compete successfully, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become profitable.our success may depend upon how we and our competitors anticipate and adapt to market conditions. the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, emerging competition and new product introductions. new technologies, techniques or products could emerge with similar or better performance or may be perceived as providing better value than our systems and related tests and could exert pricing pressures on our products. it is critical to our success that we anticipate changes in technology and customer requirements and successfully introduce enhanced and competitive technology to meet our customers and prospective customers needs on a timely basis. we will need to respond to technological innovation in a rapidly changing industry and may not be able to maintain our technological advantages over emerging technologies in the future. if we fail to keep pace with emerging technologies, our systems and related tests will become uncompetitive and our market share will decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.our respiratory viral panel test and other menu items that we develop in the future may have sales that fluctuate on a seasonal basis and, as a result, our results of operations for successive quarters may not accurately reflect full-year trends. our respiratory viral panel test and other menu items that we develop in the future may have sales that fluctuate on a seasonal basis. for example, we expect volume of testing for our respiratory viral panel test generally will decline during the spring and summer season and accelerate during the fall and winter season. as a result, comparison of our results of operations for successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year. we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on a timely basis, or at all. until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we will be required to finance our operations with our existing cash resources. we may need to raise additional funds in the future to support our operations. we can not be certain that additional capital will be available as needed or on acceptable terms, or at all. if we require additional capital at a time when investment in molecular diagnostics companies or in the marketplace in general is limited, we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire, or at all. if we do raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. if we obtain debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we could be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies, products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.manufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect our ability to produce products. we must manufacture, or engage third parties to manufacture, components of our products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining product quality, acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements. in determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited experience in marketing our products, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we require. we currently manufacture our proprietary test cartridges at our pasadena, california manufacturing facility. we outsource manufacturing of our xt-8 instrument and much of the disposable component molding and component assembly for our test cartridges. our xt-8 instrument is manufactured by aubrey group inc., our single source supplier that specializes in contract design and manufacturing of electronic and electromechanical devices for medical use. the components are custom-made by only a few outside vendors. reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured these components ourselves, including: reliance on third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance; possible breaches of manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control; possible regulatory violations or manufacturing problems experienced by our suppliers; and possible termination or non-renewal of agreements by third parties, based on their own business priorities, at times that are costly or inconvenient for us. we may not be able to meet the demand for our products if one or more of these third-party manufacturers is not able to supply us with the necessary components that meet our specifications. it may be difficult to find alternate suppliers in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us. the manufacturing operations for our test cartridges in pasadena, california use highly technical processes involving unique, proprietary techniques. in addition, the manufacturing equipment we use would be costly to repair or replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. any interruption in our operations or decrease in the production capacity of our manufacturing facility or the facilities of any of our suppliers because of equipment failure, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and fires or otherwise, would limit our ability to meet customer demand for the xt-8 instrument and tests and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and 13 results of operations. other possible disruptions may include power loss and telecommunications failures. in the event of a disruption, we may lose customers and we may be unable to regain those customers thereafter. our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. we plan to move our existing manufacturing operations in pasadena, california to a new facility located in carlsbad, california in the fourth quarter of 2010. our new manufacturing facility will be subject to the risks discussed above related to our pasadena manufacturing facilities. in addition, we will need to get the appropriate regulatory clearances for our new facility before commencing manufacturing operations. we may experience unexpected delays and costs in opening our new manufacturing facilities, which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.we may not be successful in developing our next-generation ad-8 system. we are developing our next-generation platform, the ad-8 system. we are designing the ad-8 system to integrate sample preparation with our esensor technology to allow technicians to be able to place a minimally prepared patient sample into our test cartridge and obtain results with no additional steps. the development of the ad-8 system is a complex process, and we may not be successful in completing the development of all the currently intended features and benefits of the ad-8 system, which may limit its marketability. in addition, before commercializing the ad-8 system we will be required to obtain regulatory approval for the ad-8 instrument as well as each of the diagnostic tests to be used on the ad-8 instrument, including those tests that previously received approval for use with our xt-8 instrument. if we are unable to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our ad-8 instrument and related diagnostic tests, our business plan will be impaired.if we are unable to retain key members of our senior management and scientists or hire additional skilled employees, we may be unable to achieve our goals. our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management and key scientific and technical personnel. our senior managers and other key employees can terminate their relationship with us at any time. we have a small number of senior managers, and the loss of services of any of these managers or our scientific or technical personnel, in particular dr.kayyem or mr.kemper, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our employees. in addition, our product development and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed if we are unable to attract, train and retain highly skilled employees and scientific advisors. to expand our research, product development and sales efforts, we will need to retain additional people skilled in areas such as electrochemical and molecular science, information technology, manufacturing, sales, marketing and technical support. because of the complex and technical nature of our systems and the dynamic market in which we compete, any failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially harm our ability to develop and commercialize our technology. we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.we may be unsuccessful in our long-term goal of expanding sales of our product offerings outside the united states. assuming we receive the applicable regulatory approvals, we intend to market our diagnostic products outside the united states through third-party distributors. these distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations. if distributors do not perform adequately or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in particular geographic areas, or we are unable to locate distributors in particular geographic areas, our ability to realize long-term international revenue growth would be materially adversely affected. 14 in order to market our products in the european union and many other foreign jurisdictions, we, or our distributors or partners, must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products. the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. the regulatory approval process outside the united states may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval, as well as additional risks. in addition, in many countries outside the united states, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. we may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the united states on a timely basis, if at all.if we expand sales of our products outside the united states, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations. if we execute our plan to expand our operations outside the united states, our inexperience in operating in foreign countries increases the risk that our international expansion will not be successful. conducting international operations would subject us to new risks that, generally, we have not faced in the united states, including: fluctuations in currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, tax inefficiencies related to our corporate structure and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. the occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and prospects. additionally, operating internationally also requires significant management attention and financial resources. we can not be certain that the investment and additional resources required in establishing operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability.we use hazardous chemicals, biological materials and infectious agents in our business. any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly. our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, biological materials and infectious disease agents. our operations produce hazardous waste products. we can not eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products, as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and may impair our research, development and production efforts. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs, 15 including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance. in addition, we can not predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced.if our products do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our products are based is questioned, our operating results and business will suffer. our success depends on the markets confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality diagnostics systems. we believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors. as a result, our reputation and the public image of our products or technologies will be impaired if our products fail to perform as expected. although our diagnostic systems are designed to be user-friendly, the functions they perform are quite complex, and our products may develop or contain undetected defects or errors. if we experience a sustained material defect or error, this could result in loss or delay of revenues, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, diversion of development and management resources, legal claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could materially harm our business. we also face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the sale of our products. we currently carry product liability insurance that covers us against specific product liability claims up to an annual aggregate limit of $7.0 million. we also carry a separate general liability and umbrella policy that covers us against certain claims but excludes coverage for product liability. any claim in excess of our insurance coverage would have to be paid out of our cash reserves, which would have a detrimental effect on our financial condition. it is difficult to determine whether we have obtained sufficient insurance to cover potential claims. also, we can not assure you that we can or will maintain our insurance policies on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards might be limited. as of december31, 2009, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $62.5million for u.s. federal tax purposes. these loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts through 2029. to the extent these net operating loss carryforwards are available, we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. section382 of the u.s. internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. as a result, prior or future changes in ownership could put limitations on the availability of our net operating loss carryforwards. in addition, our ability to utilize the current net operating loss carryforwards might be further limited by the issuance of common stock in this offering. to the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited, our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, which could result in lower profits. we also had non-u.s. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $30.4 million as of december 31, 2009. as a result of the reorganization, there is a significant risk these non-u.s. net operating loss carryforwards may not be utilized.our corporate structure may create tax inefficiencies. as a result of the reorganization, osmetech will become a subsidiary controlled by genmark and a controlled foreign corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes. genmark will be required to include in its income certain types of income and investments of osmetech that otherwise would not be currently taxable under general tax rules. in addition, distributions from the u.s. operating subsidiaries of genmark may be subject to additional u.s. and foreign income tax withholding and result in lower profits. 16 risks related to regulationthe regulatory clearance or approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain, and the failure to obtain and maintain required clearances or approvals could prevent us from commercializing our future products. we are investing in the research and development of new diagnostic tests to expand our menu of testing options, as well as to develop our next-generation ad-8 system, which we antici</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS, THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESS BEFORE PURCHASING SHARES OF THE COMMON STOCK OFFERED HEREBY. THIS PROSPECTUS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE EVENTS OR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT SUCH STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS AND THAT EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. IN EVALUATING SUCH STATEMENTS, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS AND OTHER FACTORS SET FORTH IN THIS PROSPECTUS WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS; FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Prior growth rates in the Company's revenue and net income should not be considered indicative of future results of operations. Future results of operations will depend upon many factors, including market acceptance of new services, including the Company's Credit Connection and CreditRevue Service Bureau, the demand for the Company's products and services, the successful transition from predominantly license fee-based revenue to predominantly transaction fee-based revenue, the timing of new product and service introductions and software enhancements by the Company or its competitors, the level of product, service and price competition, the length of the Company's sales cycle, the size and timing of individual transactions, the delay or deferral of customer implementations, the Company's success in expanding its customer support organization, direct sales force and indirect distribution channels, the nature and timing of significant marketing programs, the mix of products and services sold, the timing of new hires, the ability of the Company to develop and market new products and services and control costs, competitive conditions in the industry and general economic conditions. In addition, the decision to implement the Company's products or services typically involves a significant commitment of customer resources and is subject to the budget cycles of the Company's customers. Licenses of CreditRevue generally reflect a relatively high amount of revenue per order. The loss or delay of individual orders, therefore, would have a significant impact on the Company's revenue and quarterly results of operations. The timing of revenue is difficult to predict because of the length and variability of the Company's sales cycle, which has ranged to date from two to 18 months from initial customer contact to the execution of a license agreement. In addition, since a substantial portion of the Company's revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, the timing of revenue recognition for its licenses may be materially and adversely affected by delays or deferrals of customer implementations. Such delays or deferrals may also increase expenses associated with such implementations which would materially and adversely affect related operating margins. The Company's operating expenses are based in part on planned product and service introductions and anticipated revenue trends and, because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed, a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter-to-quarter and could result in operating losses. To the extent such expenses precede, or are not subsequently followed by, increased revenues, the Company's results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. As a result of these and other factors, revenues for any quarter are subject to significant variation, and the Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. There can be no assurance that the Company will be profitable in any future quarter or that such fluctuations in results of operations will not result in volatility in the price of the Company's Common Stock. Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is likely that in some future quarter the Company's results of operations will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such event, the market price of the Company's Common Stock will be materially and adversely affected. See "-- Market Acceptance of Credit Connection; Transition to Transaction-Based Revenue" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Quarterly Information. DEPENDENCE ON CREDITREVUE PRODUCT LINE License fees, maintenance fees and third-party computer hardware sales associated with licenses and installations of CreditRevue accounted for virtually all of the Company's revenues through September 30, 1996. Although the Company has recently introduced its Credit Connection service, the Company expects that 6 7 revenues generated from licenses and installations of CreditRevue will continue to account for a significant portion of the Company's revenues for the foreseeable future. To date, Credit Connection has generated approximately $27,000 in revenues. The life cycles of the Company's products and services are difficult to predict due to the effect of new product and service introductions or software enhancements by the Company or its competitors, market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the Company's products and services, and competition in the Company's marketplace. A decline in the demand for CreditRevue, whether as a result of competition, technological change, price reductions or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.LENGTHY SALES AND IMPLEMENTATION CYCLE The licensing of the Company's software products and services is often an enterprise-wide decision by prospective customers and generally requires the Company to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of the Company's products and services. In addition, the implementation of the Company's software products involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers and is commonly accompanied by substantial reengineering efforts and a review of the customer's credit analysis, decisioning and funding processes. The cost to the customer of the Company's products and services is typically only a portion of the related hardware, software, development, training and integration costs associated with implementing a large-scale automated credit origination information system. For these and other reasons, the period between initial customer contact and the implementation of the Company's products is often lengthy (ranging from between two and 18 months) and is subject to a number of significant delays over which the Company has little or no control. The Company's implementation cycle could be lengthened by increases in the size and complexity of its license transactions and by delays or deferrals in its customers' implementation of appropriate interfaces and networking capabilities. Delays in the sale or implementation of a limited number of license transactions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition and cause the Company's results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF CREDIT CONNECTION; TRANSITION TO TRANSACTION-BASED REVENUE The Company's Credit Connection service has recently been commercially introduced and the Company's CreditRevue Service Bureau service is under development and is expected to be introduced in late 1997. These services are projected to account for a significant portion of the Company's revenues in the future. As a result, demand and market acceptance for these services are subject to a high level of uncertainty, and the Company will be heavily dependent on their market acceptance. There can be no assurance that these services will be commercially successful. The failure of the Company to generate demand for Credit Connection or CreditRevue Service Bureau or the occurrence of any significant technological problems with such services would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Historically, virtually all of the Company's revenues have been derived from license fees, maintenance fees and hardware sales associated with licenses and installations of CreditRevue. Under the terms of its license agreements, a majority of the Company's revenues are realized during the configuration and installation of CreditRevue. However, the Company anticipates that a significant portion of the Company's future revenues will be derived from per-usage transaction-based fees charged to credit originators and financial institutions for transactions originated from the Credit Connection and CreditRevue Service Bureau services. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully manage the transition of a significant portion of its revenues from license-based revenue to transaction-based revenue. The failure of the Company to successfully manage the transition to a transaction-based revenue stream would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. 7 8 RELIANCE ON CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS The Company has established relationships with a number of companies that it believes are important to its sales, marketing and support activities, as well as to its product, service and software development efforts. The Company has relationships with automated scorecard companies, hardware vendors and credit bureaus and has also entered into an agreement to form a strategic alliance with ADP for remarketing Credit Connection. There can be no assurance that these companies, most of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than the Company, will not develop or market products and services which will compete with the Company's products and services in the future. Furthermore, since many of these relationships are informal in nature, they are terminable by either party at will. Other relationships are terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period. There can be no assurance that these companies will not otherwise discontinue their relationships with or support of the Company. The failure by the Company to maintain its existing relationships or to establish new relationships in the future, because of a divergence of interests, acquisition of one or more of these third parties or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Sales and Marketing.DEPENDENCE ON LARGE LICENSE FEE CONTRACTS AND CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION A relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of the Company's revenues. License fees for CreditRevue are based on a percentage-of-completion method on a cost-incurred basis with the final installment being paid in full upon acceptance of the Company's software. The Company receives continuing revenues on CreditRevue from annual maintenance agreements which commence upon acceptance of the software by the customer. Maintenance agreements are renewable annually by the customer, and the license agreements are generally co-terminous with the maintenance agreements. Although the Company has experienced a high degree of customer loyalty, the Company cannot predict how many maintenance agreements will be renewed or the number of years of renewal. Revenues generated by the Company's 10 largest customers accounted for 77.4% and 73.4% of total revenues in 1995 and the first nine months of 1996, respectively. Two of the Company's customers accounted for 19.9% and 12.9% of total revenues, respectively, in 1995. The Company expects that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future. The loss of any major customer or any reduction or delay in orders by any such customer, delay or deferral in configurations or enhancements by such customers or the failure of the Company to successfully market its products or services to new customers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.DEPENDENCE ON CONSUMER RETAIL LENDING INDUSTRY; CYCLICAL NATURE OF CONSUMER LENDING The Company's business is currently concentrated in the consumer lending industry and is expected to be so concentrated for the foreseeable future, thereby making the Company susceptible to a downturn in the consumer lending industry. For example, a decrease in consumer lending could result in a smaller overall market for the Company's products and services. Furthermore, banks in the United States are continuing to consolidate, decreasing the overall potential number of customers for the Company's products and services. In addition, demand for consumer loans has been historically cyclical, in large part based on general economic conditions and cycles in overall consumer indebtedness levels. Changes in general economic conditions that adversely affect the demand for consumer loans, the willingness of financial institutions to provide funds for such loans, changes in interest rates and the overall consumer indebtedness level, as well as other factors affecting the consumer lending industry, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 8 9 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGING BUSINESS The Company has experienced significant changes in its business, such as an expansion in the Company's staff and customer base and the development of new products, services and enhancements to its software, including the recent commercial release of Credit Connection. Such changes have placed and may continue to place a significant strain upon the Company's management, systems and resources. As of September 30, 1996, the Company had grown to 134 employees from 103 employees at December 31, 1995. The Company's ability to compete effectively and to manage future changes will require the Company to continue to improve its financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and budgeting and forecasting capabilities on a timely basis and expand its sales and marketing work force, and train and manage its employee work force. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to manage such changes successfully. The Company's failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Sales and Marketing.DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL The Company's future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its key technical, sales and senior management personnel, particularly James R. DeFrancesco, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Scott L. Freiman, Executive Vice President. The Company has applied for key-person life insurance on the lives of each of Messrs. DeFrancesco and Freiman. The loss of the services of one or more of the Company's executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company retains its key employees through the use of equity incentive programs, including stock option plans, employee stock purchase plans, and competitive compensation packages. The Company has no employment agreements and does not intend to enter into any such agreements in the foreseeable future. The Company's future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, customer support, sales and managerial personnel. In particular, the Company has encountered difficulties in hiring sufficient numbers of programmers and technical personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain its key technical, sales and managerial employees or that it can attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel in the future. See "Management.RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE; RISK ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR ENHANCEMENTS The credit processing software products and services industry in which the Company competes is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and services, changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards. The introduction or announcement of new products, services or enhancements by the Company or one or more of its competitors embodying new technologies or changes in industry standards or customer requirements could render the Company's existing products or services obsolete or unmarketable. Accordingly, the life cycles of the Company's products are difficult to estimate. The Company's future results of operations will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance its products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis that will keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, as well as address the increasingly sophisticated needs of the Company's customers. There can be no assurance that these new products and services will gain market acceptance or that the Company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or services that respond to technological change, evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements, that the Company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these products or services, or that its new products or services will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve any significant degree of market acceptance. In addition, a majority of the Company's current products operate in the UNIX operating system. Although the Company's software is designed to work with other operating environments, a requirement to port to a different operating system could be costly and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure of the Company to develop and introduce, for technological or other reasons, new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of 9 10 operations and financial condition. Furthermore, the introduction or announcement of new product or service offerings or enhancements by the Company or the Company's competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of the Company's products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Product Development.SYSTEM INTERRUPTION AND SECURITY RISKS; POTENTIAL LIABILITY; POSSIBLE LACK OF ADEQUATE INSURANCE; AND SYSTEM INADEQUACY The Company's operations are dependent, in part, on its ability to protect its system from interruption by damage from fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunication failure, unauthorized entry or other events beyond the Company's control. The Company's computer equipment constituting its central computer system, including its processing operations, is located at a single site. The Company is currently in the planning stages of acquiring and implementing a back-up, off-site processing system capable of supporting its operations in the event of system failure. The Company intends to have such system operational by the second quarter of 1997. Prior to such implementation, the Company's operations are subject to substantial risks, including temporary interruptions resulting from damage caused by any one or more of the foregoing factors or due to other causes including computer viruses, hackers or similar disruptive problems. While the Company maintains $1.84 million of property insurance policies, a business interruption insurance policy, a $3.0 million errors and omissions insurance policy and a $3.0 million umbrella insurance policy, such insurance may not be adequate to compensate the Company for all losses that may occur or to provide for costs associated with system failure or business interruption. Any damage or failure that causes interruptions in the Company's operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Persistent problems continue to affect public and private data networks. For example, in a number of networks, hackers have bypassed firewalls and have appropriated confidential information. Such computer break-ins and other disruptions may jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the computer systems of the parties utilizing the Company's services, which may result in significant liability to the Company and also may deter potential customers from using the Company's services. In addition, while the Company attempts to be careful with respect to the employees it hires and maintain controls through software design, security systems and accounting procedures to prevent unauthorized employee access, it is possible that, despite such safeguards, an employee of the Company could obtain access, which would also expose the Company to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability to users. The Company attempts to limit its liability to customers, including liability arising from the failure of the security features contained in the Company's system and services, through contractual provisions. However, there can be no assurance that such limitations will be enforceable. There can be no guarantee that the growth of the Company's customer base will not strain or exceed the capacity of its computer and telecommunications systems and lead to degradations in performance or system failure. Any damage, failure or delay that causes interruptions in the Company's operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. RISK OF DEFECTS, DEVELOPMENT DELAYS AND LACK OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE Software products and services as sophisticated as those offered by the Company often encounter development delays and may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions are released. The Company has in the past and may in the future experience delays in the development of software and has discovered, and may in the future discover, software defects in certain of its products. Such delays and defects may result in lost revenues during the time corrective measures are being taken. Although the Company has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects to date, there can be no assurance that, despite testing by the Company, errors will not be found in its existing software in future releases or enhancements, or that the Company will not experience development delays, resulting in delays in the commercial release of new products and services, the loss of market share or the failure to achieve market acceptance. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Products and Services" and "-- Product Development." 10 11 FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS; UNCERTAINTY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING The Company currently anticipates that its available cash resources combined with the net proceeds of this Offering, as well as anticipated funds from operations, will be sufficient to meet its presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements through 1997. Thereafter, the Company may need to raise additional funds. The Company may need to raise additional funds sooner in order to fund more rapid expansion, to develop new or enhanced products and services, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary businesses or technologies. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of the stockholders of the Company will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution, or such equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the Company's Common Stock. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to the Company or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to develop or enhance its products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Dilution" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources.DEPENDENCE ON PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; RISKS OF INFRINGEMENT The Company's success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technology. The Company regards its software products and services as proprietary, and relies primarily on a combination of contract, copyright and trademark law, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights. The Company has no patents on its products currently in commercial use, and existing trade secrets and copyright laws afford only limited protection. The Company has applied for a United States patent on portions of Credit Connection. There can be no assurance that a patent will be granted pursuant to the Company's application or that, if granted, such patent would survive a legal challenge to its validity or provide adequate protection. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not design around any patents issued to the Company. It is the Company's policy to enter into confidentiality and assignment agreements with its employees. Despite the Company's efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company's products or technology without authorization, to obtain and use information that the Company regards as proprietary, or to develop similar or superior products or technology independently. Policing unauthorized use of the Company's products is difficult, and while the Company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem, particularly in international markets and as a result of the growing use of the Internet. The source code for the Company's proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. The Company has in the past and may in the future make source codes for one or more of its products available to certain of its customers and strategic partners which may increase the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of the Company's software. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the Company's proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the Company's competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company's technologies. The Company is not aware that any of its products, services, trademarks or other proprietary rights infringe the proprietary rights of third parties. However, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company in the future with respect to current or future products or services. The Company has obtained a perpetual, worldwide license for the use of the registered trademark Credit Connection. As the number of software products and services in the industry increases and the functionality of these products and services further overlaps, the Company believes that software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that former employers of the Company's present and future employees will not assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to the Company. Any such claims, with or without merit, can be time consuming and expensive to defend, cause product and service delays or require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all, which could have 11 12 a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights.COMPETITION; FUTURE PRICE EROSION The credit processing software and services industry is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. The Company believes its ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside its control, including the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by the Company and its competitors, including (i) application software companies, (ii) management information systems departments of potential customers, (iii) third party professional services organizations, and (iv) computer services outsourcing providers which offer service bureau-based credit processing solutions. Competitors for CreditRevue include American Management Systems, Inc., Appro Systems, Inc., CFI ProServices, Inc., Fair, Isaac and Company, Inc. and Affinity Technology Group, Inc. Competitors for Credit Connection include The Reynolds & Reynolds Company and International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), which has recently announced a system for processing automobile loans over the Internet in conjunction with The Chase Manhattan Bank. Many of the Company's competitors are substantially larger than the Company and have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and established, extensive direct and indirect channels of distribution. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than the Company. As is typical in the software industry, many actual or potential customers of the Company may become competitors by developing competitive technology internally. Due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the software market, the Company expects additional competition from other established and emerging companies as the credit processing software market continues to develop and expand. The Company also expects that competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidations. The Company's competitors may develop or acquire products or services that provide functionality that is similar to that produced by the Company's products and services and such products and services may be offered at a significantly lower price or bundled with other products and services. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of the Company's prospective customers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operat</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the related notes and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. the occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, and growth prospects. in such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. risks related to our business and industry the market for our antenna products is developing and may not develop as we expect. the market for our antenna products, and specifically the wi-fi market, is developing and may not develop as we expect. we believe our future success will depend in large part on the growth in the market for wi-fi devices that provide in-home wireless data connectivity for internet and video distribution. it is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewal rates, customer demand for our antennas, the size and growth rate of this market, the entry of competitive products, or the success of existing competitive products. any expansion in our market depends on several factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our antennas. if our antenna products do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for antennas in our market caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions, or otherwise, it could result in reduced customer orders, early order cancellations, or decreased sales, any of which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance. our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. the timing and size of sales of our products are variable and difficult to predict and can result in fluctuations in our net sales from period to period. in addition, our budgeted expense levels depend in part on our expectations of future sales. because any substantial adjustment to expenses to account for lower levels of sales is difficult and takes time, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in net sales, and even a small shortfall in net sales could disproportionately and adversely affect our operating margin and operating results for a given quarter. our operating results may also fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the changing and volatile u.s., european, asian and global economic environments, and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. besides the other risks in this risk factors section, factors that may affect our operating results include: fluctuations in demand for our products and services; the inherent complexity, length and associated unpredictability of product development windows and product lifecycles; changes in customers budgets for technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles; changing market conditions; any significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including new entrants, or further consolidation; the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors; and 12 our ability to develop, introduce and ship in a timely manner new products and product enhancements and anticipate future market demands that meet our customers requirements. the cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. as a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. you should not rely on our past results as an indication of future performance.our products are subject to intense competition, including competition from the customers to whom we sell. antenna solutions is an established technical field with low intellectual property and technological barriers to entry. antenna competition exists globally for all areas of our business and product lines. the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants. the markets are influenced by, among others, brand awareness and reputation, price, strength and scale of sales and marketing efforts, professional services and customer support, product features, reliability and performance, scalability of products, and breadth of product offerings. due to the proprietary nature of our products, competition occurs primarily at the design stage. as a result, a design win by our competitors or by us typically limits further competition regarding that design. this competition could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which would likely seriously harm our business, operating results or financial condition. from a cost and control perspective, our products generally cost more than our competitors products and add a degree of complexity to an oem and odm product planning and manufacturing process. if our ability to design antenna solutions is deemed to be on par or of lesser value than competing solutions, we could lose our customers and prospects.new entrants and the introduction of other distribution models in our markets may harm our competitive position. the markets for development, distribution, and sale of our products are rapidly evolving. new entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products, and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition. historically, large, integrated telecommunications equipment suppliers controlled access to the wireless broadband infrastructure equipment and network management software that could be used to extend the geographic reach of wireless internet networks. however, in recent years, network operators and service providers have been able to purchase wireless broadband infrastructure equipment and purchase and implement network management applications from distributors, resellers, and oems and odms. increased competition from providers of wireless broadband equipment may result in fewer vendors providing complementary equipment, which could harm our business and sales. broadband equipment providers or system integrators may also offer wireless broadband infrastructure equipment for free or as part of a bundled offering, which could force us to reduce our prices or change our selling model to remain competitive. if there is a major shift in the market such that network operators and service providers begin to use closed network solutions that only operate with other equipment from the same vendor, we could experience a significant decline in sales because our products would not be interoperable with these proprietary standards.our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products for the wireless market that meet the needs of our customers. our sales depend on our ability to anticipate our existing and prospective customers needs and develop products that address those needs. our future success will depend on our ability to introduce new products for the wireless market, anticipate improvements and enhancements in wireless technology and wireless standards, and 13 to develop products that are competitive in the rapidly changing wireless industry. introduction of new products and product enhancements will require coordination of our efforts with those of our customers, suppliers, and manufacturers to rapidly achieve volume production. if we fail to coordinate these efforts, develop product enhancements or introduce new products that meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected and our business and prospects will be harmed. we cannot assure that product introductions will meet the anticipated release schedules or that our wireless products will be competitive in the market. furthermore, given the emerging nature of the wireless market, there can be no assurance our products and technology will not be rendered obsolete by alternative or competing technologies.our business is characterized by short product development windows and short product lifecycles. our solutions are purchased and integrated by customers in the electronics industry. in many cases, the products that include our solutions are subject to short product development windows and short product lifecycles. in the case of the short product development window, we may be pressured to provide solutions that are the lowest in cost to be accepted. customer pressure could force us to reduce our price to win designs with short development windows. regarding short product lifecycles, we might provide up-front design and engineering work, but ultimately lose the design to a competitor, or even if we win the design, such design could be extremely short-lived due to our customers inability to sell the product in significant volume. our up-front costs associated with a design can be significant, and if the sales volumes are inadequate due to lack of acceptance and/or short lifecycle, our financial performance will be impaired.any delays in our sales cycles could result in customers canceling purchases of our products. sales cycles for some of our products can be lengthy, often lasting several months to a year or longer. in addition, it can take additional time before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products. sales cycles can be lengthy for several reasons, including: our oem customers and carriers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products, over which we have no control, before placing a purchase order; the commercial introduction of our products by oem customers and carriers is typically limited during the initial release to evaluate product performance; and the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayed. a significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders. the lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult. in addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases. if customer cancellations or product changes were to occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses. in addition, although we currently do not maintain significant inventories, we may in the future establish significant inventory levels to meet forecasted future demand. if the forecasted demand does not materialize into purchase orders for these products, we may be required to write off our inventory balances or reduce the value of our inventory, based on a reduced sales price. a write off of the inventory, or a reduction in the inventory value due to a sales price reduction, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.we have a history of losses, and we may not be profitable in the future. before 2013, we had incurred net losses in each year since our inception. as a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $46.8 million at march31, 2016. because the market for our antenna products is rapidly evolving, it is difficult for us to predict our operating results. we expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, particularly in engineering, sales, and marketing, and 14 continue to develop new antenna products to address new and evolving markets. in addition, as we grow and as we become a newly public company, we will incur additional significant legal, accounting, and other expenses we did not incur as a private company. if our sales do not increase to offset these increases in our operating expenses, we may not be profitable in future periods. our historical sales growth has been inconsistent and should not be considered indicative of our future performance. any failure to sustain or increase our profitability consistently could cause the value of our common stock to materially decline.a limited number of customers and devices represent a significant portion of our sales. if we were to lose any of these customers or devices, our sales could decrease significantly. in 2015, our top three customers accounted for approximately 28%, 15% and 12% of sales, respectively and, in the three months ended march31, 2016, our top three customers accounted for approximately 34%, 15% and 7% of sales, respectively. although our top customers that pay for our products are often odms and distributors, it is primarily the oems, carrier customers and retail-focused end-customers that drive the use of our antenna solutions and the purchase by the odms and distributors of our antenna solutions. in addition, a few end customer devices which incorporate our antenna products comprise a significant amount of our sales, and the discontinuation or modification of such devices may materially and adversely affect our sales and results of operations. for example, in august 2014, a product which accounted for $3.2 million of our sales in the six months ended june30, 2014 reached the end of its lifecycle and was discontinued. any significant loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, these other significant customers or customers that drive the use of our antenna solutions or a modification or discontinuation of a device which constitutes a significant portion of sales could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.we sell to customers who are extremely price conscious. our customers compete in segments of the electronics market. the electronics market is characterized by intense competition as companies strive to come to market with innovative designs that attract customers based upon design, performance, cost, ease of use, and convenience. product lifecycles can be extremely short as companies try to gain advantage over their competitors. because of the high design and engineering costs, companies that are customers or prospects for antenna solutions are extremely cost conscious. as a result, our customers and prospects demand price cuts in established products, and negotiate aggressively for lower pricing on new products. because of the intense competition in the antenna solution market, we encounter situations that lead to difficult price negotiations potentially resulting in lower margins than forecast.we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to produce and ship all of our products, and the failure to manage our relationships with these parties successfully could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products. we rely on two contract manufacturers, which are both located in china, to manufacture, control quality of, and ship our products. we do not have long-term contracts with these manufacturers that commit them to manufacture products for us. any significant change in our relationship with these manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. we make substantially all of our purchases from our contract manufacturers on a purchase order basis. our contract manufacturers are not required to manufacture our products for any specific period or in any specific quantity. we expect that it would take approximately six to nine months to transition manufacturing, quality assurance, and shipping services to new providers. relying on contract manufacturers for manufacturing, quality assurance, and shipping also presents significant risks to us, including the inability of our contract manufacturers to: qualify appropriate component suppliers; manage capacity during periods of high demand; meet delivery schedules; 15 assure the quality of our products; ensure adequate supplies of materials; protect our intellectual property; and deliver finished products at agreed-upon prices.we may experience delays in obtaining product from manufacturers and may not be a high priority for our manufacturers. the ability and willingness of our contract manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. we believe that our orders may not represent a material portion of our contract manufacturers total orders and, as a result, fulfilling our orders may not be a priority if our contract manufacturers are constrained in their abilities or resources to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner. if any of our contract manufacturers suffers an interruption in its business, experiences delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations or we have to change or add additional contract manufacturers, our ability to ship products to our customers would be delayed and our sales could become volatile and our cost of sales may increase.our contract manufacturers purchase some components, subassemblies and products from a single or limited number of suppliers. the loss of any of these suppliers may substantially disrupt our ability to obtain orders and fulfill sales as we design in and qualify new components. we rely on third-party components and technology to build and operate our products, and we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the components, subassemblies, and products necessary for the manufacture of our products. shortages in components we use in our products are possible, and our ability to predict the availability of such components is limited. if shortages occur in the future, as they have in the past, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. unpredictable price increases of such components due to market demand may occur. while components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products. if our suppliers of these components or technology were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of wireless networking equipment or were to discontinue providing such components and technology to us and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide our products would be impaired. additionally, poor quality in any of the single or limited sourced components in our products could result in lost sales or lost sales opportunities. we and our contract manufacturers generally rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with these suppliers. as a result, even if available, we and our contract manufacturers may not be able to secure sufficient components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build our products in a timely manner. therefore, we may be unable to meet customer demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.we rely significantly on channel partners to sell and support our products, and the failure of this channel to be effective could materially reduce our sales. our indirect channel partners, which include outside sales representatives, accounted for 19% of our sales in 2015. we believe that establishing and maintaining successful relationships with these channel partners is, and will continue to be, important to our financial success. recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technology and product offerings require significant time and resources. to develop and expand our channel, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel partners, including investment in systems and training. existing and future channel partners will only work with us if we are able to provide them with competitive products on terms that are commercially reasonable to them. if we fail to maintain the quality of our products or 16 to update and enhance them, existing and future channel partners may elect to work instead with one or more of our competitors. in addition, the terms of our arrangements with our channel partners must be commercially reasonable for both parties. if we are unable to reach agreements that are beneficial to both parties, then our channel partner relationships will not succeed. we have no minimum purchase commitments with any of our channel partners, and our contracts with channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with ours, including products they currently offer or may develop in the future and incorporate into their own systems. some of our competitors may have stronger relationships with our channel partners than we do and we have limited control, if any, as to whether those partners use our products, rather than our competitors products, or whether they devote resources to market and support our competitors products, rather than our offerings. the reduction in or loss of sales by these channel partners could materially reduce our sales. if we fail to maintain relationships with our channel partners, fail to develop new relationships with other channel partners in new markets, fail to manage, train or incentivize existing channel partners effectively, fail to provide channel partners with competitive products on terms acceptable to them, or if these channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts, our sales may decrease and our operating results could suffer.defects in our products or poor design and engineering services could result in lost sales and subject us to substantial liability. our antenna solutions are a critical element in determining the operating performance of our customers products. if our antenna solutions perform poorly, whether due to design, engineering, placement or other reasons, we could lose sales. in certain cases, if our antenna solution is found to be the component that leads to failure or a failure to meet the performance specifications of our customer, we could be required to pay monetary damages to our customer. real or perceived defects or errors in our antenna solutions could result in claims by channel partners and customers for losses they sustain. if channel partners or customers make these types of claims, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources to help correct the problem, including warranty and repair costs, process management costs and costs associated with remanufacturing our inventory. liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from claims and related liabilities and costs. in addition, regardless of the party at fault, errors of these kinds divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, damage our reputation and the reputation of our products, cause significant customer relations problems and can result in product liability claims. we maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any such claims. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert managements time and other resources. we also may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one or more of our products. the process of identifying recalled products that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources, and we may incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and significant harm to our reputation. the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.the loss of key personnel or an inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel may impair our ability to expand our business. our success depends upon the continued service and performance of our senior management team and key technical, marketing and production personnel, including charles myers, who is our president and chief executive officer. the replacement of any members of our senior management team or other key employees or consultants likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. 17 our future success also depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel. competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense. any difficulties in obtaining or retaining human resource competencies we need to achieve our business objectives may have an adverse effect on our performance.we are subject to the risk that third-party consultants will not perform their tasks effectively and that we will be unsuccessful in operating our business as a result. we rely on third parties, such as a sales consultants and engineering contractors, for a portion of the design and sales and marketing of our products. the engineering contractors typically work directly with our design team but are employed by our contract manufacturers in china. we rely on these third parties in addition to our own employees to perform the daily tasks necessary to operate our business in these areas and cannot ensure that third-party consultants will be able to complete their work for us in a timely manner. accordingly, our reliance on third parties exposes us to the risk that our business will be unsuccessful if they do not design and sell our product as expected.our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products, services and technologies, we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions of select assets and businesses. for example, we acquired certain north american assets from skycross, inc. in december 2015. when pursuing acquisitions, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. any acquisitions we complete, may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and could be viewed negatively by our end-customers, investors and financial analysts. acquisitions involve many risks. an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results, financial condition or cash flows because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition.litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation. we may become party to litigation claims and legal proceedings. litigation involves significant risks, uncertainties and costs, including distraction of management attention away from our current business operations. we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. we caution you that actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current estimates. our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all united states and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. nonetheless, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will always ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements. improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in the united states and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, as well as disgorgement of profits.our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. because we have a history of losses before 2013, we have paid non-substantial amounts of federal and state taxes. current federal and state tax laws include substantial restrictions on the annual utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change. for example, under sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change (generally defined as a cumulative change in equity ownership by 5-percent shareholders of greater than 50 percentage 18 points (by value) over a three-year period), the corporations ability to use its pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and certain other pre-ownership change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-ownership change income and taxes, as applicable, may be limited for federal income tax purposes. in may 2014, we completed our analysis to determine whether prior ownership changes have resulted in limitations on our ability to utilize these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. we determined that as of december31, 2015, we had $21.8million in available unlimited federal net operating loss carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2022, and $18.2million of unlimited california net loss carryforwards which began expiring in 2015. in addition, we had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $0.8million at december31, 2015, which if unutilized will expire between 2026 and 2034. we also had state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $0.6million at december31, 2015, which may be available to reduce future state taxes, if any, over an indefinite period. the net loss carryforwards and these tax credits are subject to examination by state and federal taxing authorities and may need to be revised as a result of any exam. as of december31, 2015, there were $1.4million in total unrecognized tax benefits. if recognized, none of these unrecognized tax benefits would result in a tax benefit since they would be fully offset with a valuation allowance. if tax rules and regulations change, and we are not able to apply these carryforwards, we may be forced to pay taxes at a rate and time prior to what is anticipated today.our election to not opt out of the extended accounting transition period under the jumpstart our business startups act of 2012, or the jobs act, may make our financial statements difficult to compare to other companies. under the jobs act, as an emerging growth company, we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the public company accounting oversight board or the u.s. securities and exchange commission, or the sec. we have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period. this means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, are permitted to use any extended transition </td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS Before you invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the various risks, including those described below, together with all of the other information included in this prospectus. Risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could cause our sales revenues to decreaseOur sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we were to lose one or more of these customers, or if one or more of these customers were to delay or reduce purchases of our products, our sales revenues may decrease. For the six months ended June 30, 1999, approximately 81% of our revenues were generated by five of our customers, and revenues derived from sales to Talent Trade Asia, TriGem and Silicon Application Corporation accounted for 42%, 20% and 10%, respectively, of our product sales. For the year ended December 31, 1998, approximately 60% of our revenues were generated by five of our customers, and revenues derived from sales to Silicon Application Corporation, BTC, Askey Computer and Zoltrix accounted for 15%, 13%, 12% and 12%, respectively, of our product sales. These customers may in the future decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns, because: . we do not have any long-term purchase arrangements or contracts with these or any of our other customers, . our product sales to date have been made primarily on a purchase order basis, which permit our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice and without penalty, and . many of our customers also have pre-existing relationships with current or potential competitors which may affect our customers' purchasing decisionsWe expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next 12 to 18 months and that a significant portion of our sales will continue to be made on the basis of purchase orders. We have significant sales and operations concentrated in Asia. Continued political and economic instability in Asia and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase market demand for our productsOur sales to customers located in Asia accounted for 74%, 77% and 76% of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively, and 77% and 99% of total revenues in the six months ended June 30, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The predominance of our sales are in Asia, mostly in Taiwan and China, because our customers are primarily motherboard or modem manufacturers that are located there. In many cases, our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers specify that our products be included on the modem boards or motherboards, the main printed circuit board containing the central processing unit of a computer system, that they purchase from board manufacturers, and we sell our products directly to the board manufacturers for resale to our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers. Industry statistics indicate that approximately two thirds of modems manufactured in Asia are sold back to original equipment manufacturers located in the United States. Due to the industry-wide concentration of modem manufacturers in Asia, we believe 7 that a high percentage of our future sales will continue to be concentrated with Asian customers. As a result, our future operating results could be uniquely affected by a variety of factors outside of our control, including: . political and economic instability, such as the recent political instability in Indonesia and the economic turmoil in Japan, . changes in tariffs, quotas, import restrictions and other trade barriers which may make our products more expensive compared to our competitors, . delays in collecting accounts receivable, which we have experienced from time to time, and . fluctuations in the value of Asian currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which may make it more costly for us to do business in Asia which may in turn make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our revenuesTo successfully expand our sales in Asia and internationally, we must strengthen foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international distributors and resellers. This will require significant management attention and financial resources. To the extent that we are unable to effect these additions in a timely manner, we may not be able to maintain or increase market demand for our products in Asia and internationally, and our operating results could be hurt. The recent earthquake in Taiwan and subsequent aftershocks may cause our revenues or profitability to decreaseBecause our products are sold to motherboard or modem manufacturer customers in Taiwan, the recent earthquake in Taiwan may result in less demand for our products and may cause our revenues to decrease. Our customers who are outside of Taiwan may also be dependent on other components manufactured in Taiwan. The recent earthquake may disrupt the operations of our customers' other suppliers who are located in Taiwan, and may result in a decrease in demand of our products. We are also dependent on our suppliers who manufacture product components in Taiwan. The recent earthquake may disrupt the operations of these suppliers. If they are not able to adequately supply us, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products. We do not currently believe that the effect of this earthquake on our business will be material. However, due to the nature of this disaster and the fact that its full impact on our business has not been fully evaluated, our sales to customers in Asia may be affected in the next few quarters. Continuing decreases in the average selling prices of our products could result in decreased revenuesProduct sales in the connectivity industry have been characterized by continuing erosion of average selling prices. Price erosion experienced by any company can cause revenues and gross margins to decline. The average selling price of our products has decreased by approximately 40% from October 1995 to June 30, 1999. We expect this trend to continueIn addition, we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards in the soft modem industry is likely to further erode average selling prices, particularly for analog modems. Adoption of industry standards is driven by the market requirement to have interoperable modems. End users need this interoperability to ensure modems from different manufacturers communicate with each other without problems. Historically, users have deferred purchasing modems until these industry standards are adopted. However, once these standards are accepted, it lowers the barriers to entry and price erosion has resulted. Decreasing average selling prices in our products could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units that we sell increases. Therefore, we must continue to develop and introduce next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins. Our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margin to decline. Our gross margins may vary based on the mix of sales of our products and services, and these variations may hurt our net incomeWe derive a significant portion of our sales from our software-based connectivity products. We expect margins on newly introduced products generally to be higher than our existing products. However, due in part to 8 the competitive pricing pressures that affect our products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs, we expect margins from both existing and future products to decrease over time. In addition, licensing revenues from our products historically have provided higher margins than of our product sales. Changes in the mix of products sold and the percentage of our sales in any quarter attributable to products as compared to licensing revenues will cause our quarterly results to vary and could result in a decrease in net income. Our revenues may fluctuate each quarter due to both domestic and international seasonal trendsWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in sales of our connectivity products. These seasonal trends materially affect our quarter-to-quarter operating results. Our revenues are higher during the back- to-school and holiday seasons which fall in the third and fourth calendar quarters. Revenue in our third and fourth quarters are typically higher relative to other quarters because many purchasers of PCs make purchase decisions based on their calendar year-end budgeting requirements. As a result, we generally expect revenue levels for the first quarter to be less than those for the preceding quarterWe are currently expanding our sales in international markets, particularly in Asia, Europe and South America. We expect our third quarter to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity and spending activity generally associated with that time of year, particularly in Europe. To the extent that our revenues in Asia, Europe or other parts of the world increase in future periods, we expect our period-to-period revenues to reflect seasonal buying patterns in these markets. Any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in customers cancelling purchases of our productsSales cycles for our products with major customers are lengthy, often lasting six months or longer. In addition, it can take an additional six months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products. Sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons: . our original equipment manufacturer customers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products, over which we have no control, before placing a purchase order, . the commercial integration of our products by an original equipment manufacturer is typically limited during the initial release to evaluate product performance, and . the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayedA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders. The lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases. If customer cancellations or product changes were to occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses. We expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future and these increased expenses may diminish our ability to remain profitableAlthough we have been profitable in recent years, we may not remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially over at least the next three years as we: . further develop and introduce new applications and functionality for our host signal processing technology, . explore emerging product opportunities in digital technologies and wireless and cable communications, . expand our distribution channels, both domestically and in our international markets, and . pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions. 9 In order to maintain profitability we will be required to increase our revenues to meet these additional expenses. Any failure to significantly increase our revenues as we implement our product, service, distribution and strategic relationship strategies would result in a decrease in our overall revenuesTo date, we have principally relied upon our distributor sales organization for product sales to smaller accounts. Our direct sales efforts have focused principally on board manufacturers and smaller PC original equipment manufacturers. To increase penetration of our target customer base, including large, tier-one original equipment manufacturers, we must significantly increase the size of our direct sales force and organize and deploy sales teams targeted at specific domestic tier-one original equipment manufacturer accounts. If we are unable to expand our sales to additional original equipment manufacturers, our revenues may not meet analysts' expectations which could cause our stock price to drop. We must accurately forecast our customer demand for our modem products. If there is an unexpected fluctuation in demand for our products, we may incur excessive operating costs or lose product revenuesWe must forecast and place purchase orders for specialized semiconductor chips, the application specific integrated circuit, coder/decoder and discrete access array, or data access arrangement, components of our modem products, several months before we receive purchase orders from our own customers. This forecasting and order lead time requirement limits our ability to react to unexpected fluctuations in demand for our products. These fluctuations can be unexpected and may cause us to have excess inventory, or a shortage, of a particular product. In the event that our forecasts are inaccurate, we may need to write down excess inventory. For example, we were required to write down inventory in the second quarter of 1996 in connection with a product transition within our 14.4 Kbps product family. Similarly, if we fail to purchase sufficient supplies on a timely basis, we may incur additional rush charges or we may lose product revenues if we are not able to meet a purchase order. These failures could also adversely affect our customer relations. Significant write- downs of excess inventory or declines in inventory value in the future could cause our net income and gross margin to decrease. We rely heavily on our intellectual property rights which offer only limited protection against potential infringers. Unauthorized use of our technology may result in development of products that compete with our products which could cause our market share and our revenues to be reducedOur success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. These means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate. We hold a total of 32 patents, a number of which cover technology that is considered essential for International Telecommunications Union standard communications solutions, and also have 26 additional patent applications pending or filed. These patents may never be issued. These patents, both issued and pending, may not provide sufficiently broad protection against third party infringement lawsuits or they may not prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Other than the Motorola and ESS lawsuits described elsewhere in this prospectus, to date, no material lawsuits relating to intellectual property have been filed against usDespite precautions that we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may provide our licensees with access to our proprietary information underlying our licensed applications. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology. Finally, policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and some foreign laws, including those of various countries in Asia, do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as United States laws. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resourcesWe have received, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. These claims could affect our relationships with existing customers and may prevent potential future customers from purchasing our products or licensing our 10 technology. Because we depend upon a limited number of products, any claims of this kind, whether they are with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In the event that we do not prevail in litigation, we could be prevented from selling our products or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms which may not be acceptable to us. We could also be prevented from selling our products or be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Should we cross license our intellectual property in order to obtain licenses, we may no longer be able to offer a unique productNew patent applications may be currently pending or filed in the future by third parties covering technology that we use currently or may use in the future. Pending U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents are issued, and thus it is impossible to ascertain all possible patent infringement claims against us. We believe that several of our competitors, including Motorola, Lucent and ESS Technology, may have a strategy of protecting their market share by filing intellectual property claims against their competitors and may assert claims against us in the future. The legal and other expenses and diversion of resources associated with any such litigation could result in a decrease in our revenuesIn addition, some of our customer agreements include an indemnity clause that obligates us to defend and pay all damages and costs finally awarded by a court should third parties assert patent and/or copyright claims against our customers. As a result, we may be held responsible for infringement claims asserted against our customers. If our financial reserves for potential future license fees are less than any actual fees that we are required to pay, our net income would be reducedWe have established and recorded on a monthly basis a financial per-unit reserve for payment of future license fees based upon our estimate as to the likely amount of the licensing fees that we may be required to pay in the event that licenses are obtained. We believe that it is typical for participants in the modem industry to obtain licenses in exchange for grants of cross licenses rather than for payment of fees and we have based our estimates on our understanding of the license fee practices of other segments of our industry. Our reserves may not be adequate because of factors outside of our control and because these license fee practices in the modern industry may not be applicable to our experience. Competition in the connectivity market is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for, or the prices of, our products may be reducedThe connectivity device market is intensely competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors. Our current competitors include 3Com, Conexant, ESS Technology, Lucent Technologies and Motorola. Motorola introduced soft modems in the third quarter of 1998 and Conexant introduced soft modems in the fourth quarter of 1998. We expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors enhance their product offerings, new suppliers enter the connectivity device market, new communication technologies are introduced and additional networks are deployedWe may in the future also face competition from other suppliers of products based on host signal processing technology or on new or emerging communication technologies, which may render our existing or future products obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. We believe that these competitors may include Alcatel, Analog Devices, Aware, Broadcom, Com21, Efficient Networks, Orckit, Terayon Communications and Texas InstrumentsWe believe that the principal competitive factors required by users and customers in the connectivity product market include compatibility with industry standards, price, functionality, ease of use and customer service and support. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. 11 We recently hired a new President and Chief Operating Officer. If he is not successful in carrying out his duties, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability or increase our revenueIn August 1999, we hired William F. Roach as our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Roach must be successfully integrated into our organizational structure. If for any reason Mr. Roach does not successfully carry out his duties or lead our organization in an effective manner, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability or increase our revenue. In order for us to maintain our profitability and continue to introduce and develop new products for emerging markets, we must attract and retain our executive officers and qualified technical, sales, support and other administrative personnelOur past performance has been and our future performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive officers and certain key engineering, sales, marketing, financial, technical and customer support personnel. If we lost the services of one or more of our executives or key employees, a replacement could be difficult to recruit and we may not be able to grow our businessWe maintain "key person" life insurance policies on Peter Chen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, William Wen-Liang Hsu, our Vice President, Engineering, and Han Yeh, our Vice President, Technology, in the face amount of $1 million for each individual. However, these insurance policies may not adequately compensate for the loss of services of any of these individualsWe intend to hire a significant number of additional engineering, sales, support, marketing and finance personnel in the future. Competition for personnel, especially engineers and marketing and sales personnel in Silicon Valley, is intense. We are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education, backgrounds and industry experience. As of June 30, 1999, we employed a total of 58 people in our engineering department, over half of whom have advanced degrees. In the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified engineering personnel, especially developers, on a timely basis. If we are not able to hire at the levels that we plan, our ability to continue to develop products and technologies responsive to our markets will be impaired. We have experienced significant growth in our business in recent periods and failure to manage our growth could strain our management, financial and administrative resourcesOur ability to successfully sell our products and implement our business plan in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective management planning process. Future expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on our management by significantly increasing the scope of their responsibilities and resources by increasing the number of people using them. We have increased, and plan to continue to increase, the scope of our operations at a rapid rate. Our headcount has grown and will continue to grow substantially. At December 31, 1998, we had a total of 95 employees and at June 30, 1999, we had a total of 125 employees. In addition, we expect to continue to hire a significant number of new employees. To effectively manage our growth, we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls, integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. We rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test our products. If these companies do not meet their commitments to us, our ability to sell products to our customers would be impairedWe do not have our own manufacturing, assembling or testing operations. Instead, we rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test the semiconductor chips which are integral components of our products. Most of these companies are located outside of the United States. There are many risks associated with our relationships with these independent companies, including reduced control over: . delivery schedules, . quality assurance, 12 . manufacturing costs, . capacity during periods of excess demand, and . availability of access to process technologiesIn addition, the location of these independent parties outside of the United States creates additional risks resulting from the foreign regulatory, political and economic environments in which each of these companies exists. While to date we have not experienced any material problems, failures or delays by our manufacturers to provide the semiconductor chips that we require for our products, or any material change in the financial arrangements we have with these companies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer product requirementsWe design, market and sell application specific integrated circuits and outsource the manufacturing and assembly of the integrated circuits to a third party fabrication. The majority of our products and related components are manufactured by five principal companies: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, ST Microelectronics, Kawasaki/LSI, Silicon Labs and Delta Integration. We expect to continue to rely upon these third parties for these services. Currently, the data access arrangement chips used in our soft modem products are provided by a sole source, Silicon Labs, on a purchase order basis, and we have only a limited guaranteed supply arrangement under a contract with our supplier. We are currently in the process of qualifying a second source for our data access arrangement chips. Although we believe that we would be able to qualify an alternative manufacturing source for data access arrangement chips within a relatively short period of time, this transition, if necessary, could result in loss of purchase orders or customer relationships, which could result in decreased revenues. Undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance of our productsOur products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released. To date, we have not been made aware of any significant software errors or failures in our products. However, despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance. If we, our key suppliers or our customers fail to be ready for the year 2000 calendar change, our business may be disrupted and our net revenues may declineThe Year 2000 issue refers to computer programs which use two digits rather than four to define a given year and which might read a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the Year 2000. As a result, many companies' systems and software may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to function correctly after December 31, 1999Our Software. Our connectivity products are incorporated into computer products of our customers which may not be Year 2000 compliant, or which may be perceived by their markets as not meeting Year 2000 compliance requirements. As a result, it is likely that any failure of the computer products into which our products may be incorporated to be Year 2000 compliant, or any slowdown in the connectivity markets as a result of Year 2000 compliance concerns, will hurt our product sales. In addition, we believe that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by Year 2000 issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or upgrade their current software systems for Year 2000 compliance. These expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase our products. To the extent Year 2000 issues cause a significant delay in, or cancellation of, decisions to purchase our products or services, our business would suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we test and evaluate our software modems. We believe that our current products are Year 2000 compliant, meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after January 1, 2000 will not materially affect the performance of our software products or the ability of our products to transmit data involving dates. 13 Third Party Equipment And Software. We use third party equipment and software that may not be Year 2000 compliant. This equipment and software includes our key internal systems such as for our internal accounting systems or controls. If this equipment or software does not operate properly with regard to the Year 2000, we may incur unexpected expenses to remedy any problems. These costs may materially adversely affect our business. In addition, if our key internal systems fail as a result of Year 2000 problems, we could incur substantial costs and disruption of our businessCompliance. Despite our current assessment, we may not identify and correct all significant Year 2000 problems on a timely basis. Year 2000 compliance efforts may involve significant time and expense and unremediated problems could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We currently do not have any estimate of potential costs related to potential Year 2000 problems. We currently do not have plans to contact our material customers. We currently have no contingency plans to address the risks associated with unremediated Year 2000 problems. To date, we have not incurred any material costs directly associated with Year 2000 compliance efforts, except for compensation expense associated with salaried employees who have devoted some of their time to Year 2000 assessment and remediation efforts. We do not expect the total cost of Year 2000 problems to be material to our business, financial condition or operating results. However, during the months prior to the century change, we will continue to evaluate new versions of our products, new software and information systems provided by third parties and any new infrastructure systems that we acquire, to determine whether they are Year 2000 compliant. Risks Related to Our Industry If the market for applications using our host signal processing technology does not grow as we anticipate, or if our products are not accepted in this market, our revenues may stagnate and may decreaseOur success depends on the growth of the market for applications using our host signal processing technology. This market has only recently begun to develop and may not develop at the growth rates that have been suggested by industry estimates. Market demand for host signal processing technology depends primarily upon the cost and performance benefits relative to other competing solutions. For example, soft modems have only recently begun to gain acceptance in the modem market. Although we have shipped a significant number of soft modems since we began commercial sales of these products in October 1995, the current level of demand for soft modems may not be sustained or may not grow. If customers do not accept soft modems or the market for soft modems does not grow, our revenues will decreaseFurther, we are in the process of developing next generation products and applications which improve and extend upon our host signal processing technology, such as a G.Lite modem solution, an external modem product and a remote access solution. If these products are not accepted in our markets when they are introduced, our revenues and profitability will be negatively affected. Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies. If we do not adapt to these technologies, our products will become obsoleteThe connectivity product mark</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all of the other information included in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any of the following risks could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate or materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition and could result in a complete loss of your investment. Risks Related to our Business We are not profitable and do not expect to achieve profitability in the near future, if at allWe have not achieved profitability. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We incurred net losses of $321,000 from inception through December 31, 1997. For the year ended December 31, 1998, we incurred additional net losses of $5.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, we incurred additional net losses of $16.0 million and had an accumulated deficit of $21.6 million as of September 30, 1999, and we expect to report additional net losses for the period since September 30, 1999Our business plan calls for us to continue to acquire and invest in operating companies. As a result, we will continue to amortize substantial amounts of goodwill. As we grow, we expect that the amount of goodwill we will amortize in connection with these investments will represent an increasingly smaller portion of our expenses. Therefore, we expect to continue to incur net losses until that point in time when the goodwill we amortize represents a sufficiently small amount of our expenses that it is exceeded by our net income before amortization. Because we cannot predict the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we do not know when we will become profitable, if ever. We have a history of negative cash flow, and we may never achieve positive cash flowFor the year ended December 31, 1998, we had losses from operations, before depreciation and amortization, of $4.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, we had losses from operations, before depreciation and amortization, of $9.0 million, and we expect to report additional losses for the period since September 30, 1999. Additionally, we used $14.3 million in 1998 and $61.3 million in the first nine months of 1999 to acquire operations and fixed assets. If we are unable to increase our revenue to cover our costs and investment expenditures, we will continue to experience negative cash flow. For information regarding our expected losses for the three months ended December 31, 1999, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis--Recent Developments" on page 24. We may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to execute our business planWe expect that the net proceeds of this offering will fund our operations for the next 12 months. After we have used the net proceeds from this offering, we will need to obtain additional debt or equity financings to fund operations, capital expenditures for expansion of network and information systems, and acquisitions. If we obtain debt financings, we may be required to agree to restrictions on our activities that could impair our ability to execute our business plan. For example, these restrictions may prohibit us from incurring additional debt or making acquisitions without prior lender approval. If we obtain additional equity financings, the per share value of our outstanding common stock may be diluted. In general, if we are unable to obtain these financings on favorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plan. Our combined operating history is limited and may not be indicative of our future performanceAlthough a number of the operating companies we have acquired have been in operation for some time, VIA itself has a limited history of operations. Consequently, the financial information in this prospectus may not be indicative of our future performance. 6 Because we have grown rapidly and we expect our growth to continue, we may have difficulty managing our growth effectively, which could adversely affect the quality of our services and the results of our operationsWe have grown rapidly and expect to continue to grow rapidly by acquiring new companies, increasing the number of customers served and increasing the number and types of products and services we offer. We have acquired 19 companies since June 1998, and agreed to acquire one other company, and the total number of our employees grew from five to 903 between June 1, 1998 and January 14, 2000. To manage our expected growth effectively, we must . implement additional management information systems . develop additional operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls . hire and train additional personnelIf we are unable to meet these demands, the quality of our services may suffer, causing us to lose customers and revenues. If we fail to integrate operating systems, networks and management of our acquired companies successfully, we may suffer operating inefficiencies and reduced operating cash flow We may not be able to integrate our acquired companies successfully because we currently operate in 12 different countries with different governmental regulations, languages, customs, currencies and availabilities of telecommunication capacity to carry data. We will have to commit substantial management, operating, financial and other resources to integrate our operating companies and implement our business model, which will reduce our operating cash flow. Because we operate in markets where extended vacations are typical, and since in some of these markets, we receive a portion of our revenues based on customer usage, we may experience seasonal variation in our quarterly revenue and operating results that could cause our stock price to declineIn Europe and Latin America, four or more weeks of vacation is typical and often mandated under law. As a result, extended summer and winter holiday vacations are common and it is difficult to attract new customers during these periods. In these markets, our customers also pay their telephone companies for the number of minutes they spend on-line, even if we provide a local telephone number that they can use for access. We may receive a portion of these fees from the telephone companies as payment for generating usage, and customer usage generally declines in the summer months, July and August in Europe and January and February in Latin America, and in December. As a result, we may experience lower revenues during these periods and our operating results may be affected. To the extent our quarterly results fluctuate more widely than expected by us, securities analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. We face increasing competition for the purchase of local Internet services providers, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitionsOur business strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to identify and acquire new local Internet services providers that meet our acquisition criteria. In pursuing these opportunities, we compete with other Internet services providers, local, regional, national and global telecommunication companies and other buyers. These competitors may drive up the price of our acquisition targets or may acquire our acquisition targets. Many of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than we have. Increasing competition has raised the price we have paid for acquisitions in some markets and may continue to do so. In addition, our acquisition targets may find our competitors more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. 7 Financial information on which we rely to make future acquisitions may not be accurate, which may result in our acquiring undisclosed liabilities or experiencing lower than expected operating resultsThe companies we target for acquisition typically do not have audited financial statements and have varying degrees of internal controls and detailed financial information. As a result, we may acquire undisclosed liabilities or experience lower-than-expected revenues or higher-than-expected costs, which could adversely affect our operating results. To date, no issues of this kind have arisen that have materially adversely affected our results; however, they may arise in the future. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the various currencies in which we conduct business may affect our operating resultsWe record the revenues and expenses of our local operations in their home currencies and translate these amounts into U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues, expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations may adversely affect the comparability of period-to-period results. For example, the value of the Brazilian Real fluctuated by 45.6% in relation to the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and ended the period 37.2% lower than its value to the U.S. dollar in the beginning of the year. Since each Real converted to fewer U.S. dollars, our U.S. dollar revenue was reduced. In the past, the currencies of many Latin American countries, including Brazil and Mexico in particular, have experienced substantial devaluation and volatility. Our Latin American markets have a history of political and economic instability which may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our resultsWe derive and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from the Latin American markets. Latin America has experienced periods of political and economic instability. If these conditions were to reoccur, our business could be adversely affected. Historically, instability in Latin American countries has been caused by . extensive governmental involvement, control or ownership of industries in local economies, including telecommunications facilities, financial institutions and other commerce infrastructure . unexpected changes in regulatory requirements such as imposing licensing requirements or levying new taxes . slow or negative growth as a result of recessionary trends caused by foreign currency devaluations, interest rate hikes and inflation . imposition of trade barriers through trade restrictions, high tariffs and taxes . wage and price controls that reduce potential profitability of businesses Any occurrence of adverse political and economic conditions may deter growth in Internet usage or create uncertainty regarding our operating climate, which my adversely impact our business. Currently, we do not have political risk insurance to guard against business interruptions and other losses caused by political acts. Logistical problems or economic downturns that could result from the introduction of the Euro may affect our ability to operate and adversely impact our operating resultsOn January 1, 1999, 11 of the 15 European Union member countries adopted the Euro as their common legal currency, at which time their respective individual currencies became fixed at a rate of exchange to the Euro, and the Euro became a currency in its own right. During a January 1, 1999 to January 1, 2002 transition period, we must manage transactions with our customers and our third-party vendors who conduct business in Euro participating countries in both the Euro and the individual currencies. If we, our customers or our vendors experience systems problems in converting to the Euro, we could be unable to bill and collect from customers or pay vendors for services, and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. 8The establishment of the European Monetary Union may have a significant effect on the economies of the participant countries. Since a substantial portion of our revenue will be denominated in the Euro or currencies of European Union countries, our operating results could be adversely affected if there is a downturn in the economies of participating countries or if the Euro weakens against other currencies. Our brand names are difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third partiesWe are aware of other companies using or claiming to have rights to use our trademarks and variations of those marks, including the VIA NET.WORKS mark. In particular, one company has notified us that it believes our use of the VIA NET.WORKS mark in Brazil infringes upon its trademark applications. The users of these or similar marks may be found to have senior rights if they were ever to assert a claim against us for trademark infringement. If an infringement suit were instituted against us, even if groundless, it could result in substantial litigation expenses in defending the suit. If such a suit were to be successful, we could be forced to cease using the mark and to pay damagesWe have applied to register several of our trademarks in various countries. Our application to register in Argentina the trademark "VIA Net Works Argentina" has been opposed by a third party. If any of our applications are unsuccessful, we may be required to discontinue the use of those trademarks. Risks Related to our Industry Regulatory and economic conditions of the countries where our operating companies are located are uncertain and may decrease demand for our services, increase our cost of doing business or otherwise reduce our business prospectsOur operating companies are located in countries with rapidly changing regulatory and economic conditions which may affect the Internet services industry. Any new law or regulation pertaining to the Internet or telecommunications, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, could decrease demand for our services, increase our costs or otherwise reduce our profitability or business prospects. Specific examples of the types of laws or regulations that could adversely affect us include laws that . impose taxes on transactions made over the Internet . impose telecommunications access fees on Internet services providers . directly or indirectly affect telecommunications costs generally or the costs of Internet telecommunications specifically . prohibit the transmission over the Internet of various types of information and content . impose requirements on Internet services providers to protect Internet users' privacy or to permit government interception of data traffic . increase the likelihood or scope of competition from telecommunications or cable companiesFor example, some states of Brazil impose a tax of up to 30% on revenues generated by communications services. There has been no judicial determination that Internet access services constitute communications services. If Internet services providers are ultimately required to pay this tax, our Brazilian operations would be negatively and significantly impactedThese laws could require us to incur costs to comply with them or to incur new liability. They could also increase our competition or change our competitive environment so that customer demand for our products and services is affected. For a discussion of specific regulatory proposals that may affect our business, see "Business--Regulatory Matters."In addition to risks we face from new laws or regulations, we face uncertainties in connection with the application of existing laws to the Internet. It may take years to determine the manner in which existing laws 9 governing issues like property ownership, libel, negligence and personal privacy will be applied to communications and commerce over the Internet. Increasing competition for customers in our markets may cause us to reduce our prices or increase spending, which may negatively affect our revenues and operating resultsThere are competitors in our markets with more significant market presence and brand recognition and greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. As a result of this competition, we currently face and expect to continue to face significant pressure to reduce our prices and improve the products and services we offer. Although the competitors we face vary depending on the market and the country, these competitors may include local and regional Internet services providers, telecommunication companies and cable companies. Some of our competitors, especially the telecommunications companies, have large networks in place as well as a significant existing customer base. If demand for Internet services in our markets does not grow as we expect, our ability to grow our revenues will be negatively affectedInternet use in our markets is relatively low. If the market for Internet services fails to develop, or develops more slowly than expected, we may not be able to increase our revenues. Obstacles to the development of Internet services in our markets include: . low rates of personal computer ownership and usage . lack of developed infrastructure to develop Internet access and applications . limited access to Internet servicesIn particular, we depend on increasing demand for Internet services by small to mid-sized businesses in our geographic markets. Demand for Internet services by these businesses will depend partly on the degree to which these businesses' customers and suppliers adopt the Internet as a means of doing business, and partly on the extent to which these businesses adopt Internet technologies to deal with internal business processes, such as internal communications. We are in a rapidly evolving industry in which the products and services we offer, their methods of delivery and their underlying technologies are changing rapidly, and if we do not keep pace with these changes, we may fail to retain and attract customers, which would reduce our revenuesThe Internet services market is characterized by changing customer needs, frequent new service and product introductions, evolving industry standards and rapidly changing technology. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to recognize and respond to these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we fail to do so, we will not be able to compete successfully. We rely on telecommunications companies in our markets to provide our customers with reliable access to our services, and failures or delays in providing access could limit our ability to service our customers and impact our revenues and operating resultsOur customers access our services either through their normal telephone lines or dedicated lines provided by local telecommunications companies specifically for that use. In some of our markets, we experience delays in delivery of new telephone lines that have prevented our customers from accessing our services. These delays result in lost revenues. Additionally, some local telecommunications companies that provide Internet services provide delivery of telephone or dedicated lines to their Internet customers on a preferential basis, which may cause us to lose current and potential customers. We also lease network capacity from telecommunications companies and rely on the quality and availability of their service. These companies may experience disruptions of service which could disrupt our services to, or limit Internet access for, our customers. We may 10 not be able to replace or supplement these services on a timely basis or in a cost-effective manner, which may result in customer dissatisfaction and lost revenues. We depend on the reliability of our network, and a system failure or a breach of our security measures could result in a loss of customers and reduced revenuesWe are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damages from telecommunication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters and unauthorized access. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could impair our ability to provide Internet services to our customers and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers' data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches. Although we currently possess errors and omissions insurance and business interruption insurance, these policies may not provide effective coverage upon the occurrence of all events. We do not have insurance specifically to guard against losses resulting from computer viruses and security breaches. If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or lose the services of our key personnel, our operating results may sufferOur success depends on our key management, engineers, sales and marketing personnel, technical support representatives and other personnel, many of whom may be difficult to replace. If we lose key personnel, we may not be able to find suitable replacements, which may negatively affect our business. In addition, since the demand for qualified personnel in our industry is very high, we may have to increase the salaries and fringe benefits we may offer to our personnel, which may affect our operating results. We do not maintain key person life insurance on, or restrictive employment agreements with, any of our executive officers. We may be liable for information disseminated over our networkWe may face liability for information carried on or disseminated through our network. Some types of laws that may result in our liability for information disseminated over our network include: . laws designed to protect intellectual property, including trademark and copyright laws . laws relating to publicity and privacy rights and laws prohibiting defamation . laws restricting the collection, use and processing of personal data and . laws prohibiting the sale, dissemination or possession of pornographic materialThe laws governing these matters vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For information about the applicable laws that may affect our liability for information carried or disseminated through our network, see "Business-- Regulatory Matters." The availability of protection for intellectual property rights in the context of the Internet remains uncertain We rely on trademark and copyright law, laws restricting unfair trade practices, laws relating to trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. The applicability and enforceability of legal principles concerning intellectual property rights in an Internet context remains substantially uncertain as the courts and legislatures in each country in which we operate continue to address the issues. Substantially all of the countries in which we operate are signatories to the same international treaties relating to the protection of intellectual property to which the United States adheres. Nonetheless, in many of these countries, the courts have not had the opportunity to address the legal issues within the Internet context to the same degree as U.S. courts. It is therefore uncertain whether the intellectual property of our non-U.S. operations will be subject to a lesser or different degree of protection than that generally afforded in the United States. 11 The Year 2000 issue could impair our ability to provide services to our customers, increase our costs, or reduce our revenues or profitabilityYear 2000 issues may adversely affect our business and our customers' businesses. Many computer systems may fail or malfunction because they are unable to distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates. We have incurred costs to upgrade our computers to address the year 2000 issue and may in the future incur additional costs. Our customers may also need to incur costs to either upgrade their computers or correct any problems their computers may encounter, which may reduce our revenues by diverting our customers' information systems resources away from our products and services. In addition, if our computer systems or those of our telecommunications suppliers fail or malfunction as a result of Year 2000 issues, our ability to provide services to our customers will be disrupted, which could result in lost revenues, lost customers or claims for damages, which could lead to costly litigation. For information on how we are addressing year 2000 issues, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure." Risks Related to this Offering We have discretion over the use of all of the net proceeds from this offering and may fail to use them effectively to grow our businessWe will retain discretion over how to use the net proceeds of this offering. Because the proceeds are not required to be allocated to any specific investment or transaction, you will not be able to determine at this time the value or appropriateness of our use of the proceeds. You will pay a higher price for our common stock than was paid by existing stockholders and will experience immediate and substantial dilutionIf you purchase common stock in this offering, you will pay more for your shares than the amounts paid by existing stockholders for their shares. As a result, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $14.54 per share, and our existing stockholders will experience an unrealized gain of $195.6 million in the aggregate. 42,068,821, or 73.7%, of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future. These sales could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing wellAfter this offering, we will have outstanding 57,068,821 shares of common stock, based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on January 14, 2000. This amount includes the 15,000,000 shares we are selling in this offering, which may be resold in the public market immediately. The remaining 73.7%, or 42,068,821 shares, of our total outstanding shares will become available for resale in the public market, subject to restrictions under federal securities laws, as shown in the chart below. For information regarding these restrictions, see "Shares Eligible for Future Sale."As restrictions on resale end, the market price could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. &lt;TABLE&gt; &lt;CAPTION&gt; Number of shares/ % of total outstanding Date of availability for resale into public market ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------- &lt;S&gt; &lt;C&gt; 41,613,184/ 180 days after the date of this prospectus due to an 72.9% agreement these stockholders have agreed to deliver to the underwriters. However, the underwriters can waive this restriction and allow these stockholders to sell their shares at any time. 455,637/ Between 90 and 365 days after the date of this 0.8% prospectus due to the requirements of the federal securities laws. &lt;/TABLE&gt; 12In addition, holders of approximately 41,340,721 shares of common stock and non-voting common stock will be entitled to registration rights with respect to their common stock. If these holders exercise their registration rights, causing a large number of shares to be sold in the public market, our market price may drop significantly. Our stock has not traded publicly and may not trade actively after this offeringPrior to this offering, you could not buy or sell our common stock publicly. We cannot assure you that an active public trading market for our stock will develop or be sustained after this offering. The market price of our common stock, like the market prices of stocks of other Internet-related and technology companies, may fluctuate widely and rapidlyThe securities of many companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, often unrelated to the companies' operating performance. Specifically, market prices for securities of Internet-related and technology companies have frequently reached elevated levels following their initial public offerings. These levels may be unsustainable and may not bear any relationship to these companies' operating performances. If the market price of our common stock reaches an elevated level following this offering, it may materially and rapidly decline. Fluctuations in our common stock's market price may affect our visibility and credibility in the Internet services provider marketIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company. If we were to become involved in a class action suit, it could be costly and divert the attention of management. Furthermore, if adversely determined, a class action suit may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The price per share of our common stock in this offering may not be indicative of the market price that will prevail after this offeringSince our stock has not yet traded publicly, our management and the underwriters will negotiate the common stock's initial public offering price per share. The price they determine may not be indicative of the market price that will prevail after this offering. For example, the market price of our common stock after this offering could vary from the initial public offering price in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond our control: . changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts . future announcements concerning us or our competitors of key personnel changes, significant contracts, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, technological innovations or capital commitments . additions or departures of key personnel . quarterly fluctuations in operating results . fluctuations in the stock price and volume of traded shares, especially in the traditionally volatile Internet-related and technology sectors 13</td>

      <td>risk factors an investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. prior to investing in our ordinary shares, we encourage each prospective investor to carefully read this entire prospectus, including, without limitation, the following risk factors and the section of this prospectus entitled cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements. any of the following factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. if any of these risks occur, the value of our ordinary shares could decline, and you could lose all or part of your original investment. risks related to our business the accessories, footwear and apparel industries are heavily influenced by general macroeconomic cycles that affect consumer spending, and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits. purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. the success of our operations depends on a number of factors impacting discretionary consumer spending, including general economic conditions, consumer confidence, wages and unemployment, housing prices, consumer debt, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, taxation and political conditions. a continuation or worsening of the current weakness in the economy may negatively affect consumer and wholesale purchases of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we may not be able to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and operating results. the accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. we believe that our success is largely dependent on our brand image and ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design, styling, production, merchandising and pricing of products. if we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately, consumers may not purchase our products and our brand name and brand image may be impaired. even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brand image to be outdated or associate our brand with styles that are no longer popular or trend-setting. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and operating results.the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within north america and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline. we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign accessories, footwear and apparel producers and retailers, including, among others, coach, burberry, ralph lauren, herms, louis vuitton, gucci, marc jacobs, chlo and prada. competition is based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, the following: anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner; establishing and maintaining favorable brand-name recognition; determining and maintaining product quality; maintaining key employees; 11 maintaining and growing market share; developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers; establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with retail customers; pricing products appropriately; providing appropriate service and support to retailers; optimizing retail and supply chain capabilities; determining size and location of retail and department store selling space; and protecting intellectual property. in addition, some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories, footwear and apparel industries, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products. the general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. competition, along with such other factors as consolidation and changes in consumer spending patterns, could also result in significant pricing pressure. these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers, which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.the departure of our founder, members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. we depend on the services and management experience of our founder and executive officers, who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. in particular, mr.kors, our honorary chairman and chief creative officer, has provided design and executive leadership to the company since its inception. he is instrumental to our marketing and publicity strategy and is closely identified with both the brand that bears his name and our company in general. our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr.kors name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. mr.kors has the right to terminate his employment with us without cause. in addition, the leadership of john d. idol, our chairman and chief executive officer, and joseph b. parsons, our executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief operating officer, has been a critical element of our success. we also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing, design and advertising operations. competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense, and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our executive officers and key employees. although we have entered into employment agreements with mr.kors and certain of our other executive officers, including mr.idol and mr.parsons, we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future. the loss of services of one or more of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to, or relating to, the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to open and operate new retail stores and increase the number of department stores and specialty stores that sell our products. as part of our growth strategy, we intend to open and operate new retail stores and shop-in-shops within select department stores, both domestically and internationally. our ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to: identify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops will be considered successful; negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances, to secure suitable store locations; hire, train and retain personnel and field management; assimilate new personnel and field management into our corporate culture; source sufficient inventory levels; and successfully integrate new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops into our existing operations and information technology systems. we will encounter pre-operating costs and we may encounter initial losses when new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops commence operations. while we expect to open a number of additional retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops in fiscal 2012, there can be no assurance that we will open the planned number, that we will recover the expenditure costs associated with opening these new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops or that the operation of these new venues will be successful or profitable. any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. we face additional risks with respect to our strategy to expand internationally, including our efforts to further expand our operations in european countries and in japan as well as other asian countries. in some of these countries we do not yet have significant operating experience, and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations. many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including, but not limited to, employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate (including lease terms) and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and, as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. in addition, in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we have grown rapidly in recent years and we have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations; if we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our brand image and financial performance may suffer. we have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating experience at our current size. our total revenue increased from $397.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $803.3 million in fiscal 2011. if our operations continue to grow, we will be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarter personnel. our continued growth could strain our existing resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, difficulties in hiring, training and managing an 13 increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products and delays in production and shipments. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.as we expand our store base, we may be unable to maintain the same comparable store sales or average sales per square foot that we have in the past, which could cause our share price to decline. as we expand our store base, we may not be able to maintain the levels of comparable store sales that we have experienced historically. in addition, we may not be able to maintain our historic average sales per square foot as we move into new markets. if our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations, the price of our ordinary shares could decline. in addition, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. a variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot, including, among others, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. if we misjudge the market for our products, we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. these factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods and our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our ordinary shares.we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space under long-term, non-cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases; any failure to make these lease payments when due could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. we do not own any of our store facilities; instead, we lease all of our stores under operating leases. our leases generally have terms of 10 years with no renewal options. our leases generally require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs. for example, as of october 1, 2011, we were party to operating leases associated with our stores as well as other corporate facilities requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating $248.1million through fiscal 2016 and approximately $234.1 million thereafter through fiscal 2028. we expect that we will also lease any new stores we open under operating leases with terms similar to those contained in leases we have entered previously, which will further increase our operating lease expenses. our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including, among others: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; requiring a substantial portion of our available cash to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes; limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and placing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors. we depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us, we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs. our current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control. we have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell, under our trademarks, products requiring specialized expertise. we have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas, including, among others, korea, the philippines, singapore, malaysia, the middle east and turkey. our operations in china, hong kong, macau and taiwan are conducted pursuant to similar licensing agreements that we have entered into with entities that are indirectly owned by certain of our current shareholders, including mr.kors, mr.idol and sportswear holdings limited. see certain relationships and related party transactionsmichael kors far east holdings limited. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners, such arrangements may not be successful. our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the timing of new store openings, the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. in addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partners ability to: obtain capital; exercise operational and financial control over its business; manage its labor relations; maintain relationships with suppliers; manage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and maintain customer relationships. any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands. although we attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over store location and design, product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our stores and products, we may not be able to control the use by our licensing partners of each of our licensed brands. the misuse of our brands by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers, and the loss of any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenue. a small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales. net sales to our five largest wholesale customers were 30.4% of our total revenue for fiscal 2011 and 35.7% of our total revenue for fiscal 2010. our largest wholesale customer, a large, nationally recognized u.s. department store, accounted for 13.8% of our total revenue for fiscal 2011 and 14.5% of our total revenue for fiscal 2010. we do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale customers, and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. a decision by any of our major wholesale customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. during the past several years, the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes, and we expect such changes will continue. in addition, store closings by our wholesale customers decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a 15 smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. in the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores target markets. any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. these changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.a material disruption in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely extensively on our information technology (it) systems to track inventory, manage our supply chain, record and process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. the failure of our it systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or difficulty in integrating new systems could adversely affect our business. in addition, our it systems may be subject to damage and/or interruption from power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and usage errors by our employees. if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim. any significant disruption in our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.direct privacy breaches and the engagement of third parties to operate our e-commerce business could negatively affect our reputation, credibility and business. we are responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce website, michaelkors.com, and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. consumers are increasingly concerned over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. in addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our customers identity and privacy. we do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future. any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers. finally, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information, to the extent they are applicable.increases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer. the costs of raw materials used in our products are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. we are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials, and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials. the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain, but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. if one or more of our distribution facilities becomes inoperable, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. we operate a limited number of distribution facilities. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities. if any of these distribution 16 facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our customers and retail stores. in addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged facility. in addition, we currently operate our california distribution from three separate warehouses totaling approximately 350,000 square feet. the leases for these three facilities expire on march31, 2012. we have executed a lease for an approximately 500,000 square foot distribution center in whittier, california, which we believe will allow us to significantly increase our distribution capabilities and efficiency. we took possession of the new distribution center in october 2011 and intend to complete our transition into this facility prior to the march31, 2012 expiration of the leases for our existing california distribution facilities. as part of this transition, we will implement a new warehouse management system that will supplement our current legacy system and further support our efforts to operate with increased efficiency and flexibility. there are risks inherent in transitioning our existing three distribution facilities into one new facility and in implementing a new warehouse management system, including the risk of late delivery of possession of the new facility, difficulty in negotiating acceptable terms to remain temporarily in the existing facilities in the event of any such late delivery and other operational difficulties that may arise in commencing operations in a new facility with a new management system. any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations. our products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors located mainly in countries in asia, europe and central and south america. a manufacturing contractors failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. the failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any of the following factors could negatively affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results: political or labor instability, labor shortages or increases in costs of labor or production in countries where manufacturing contractors and suppliers are located; political or military conflict involving the united states, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials and increase transportation costs; heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods of time or could result in increased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands; a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials; disease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas; the migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced; imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust in a timely manner to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed; increases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; 17 significant fluctuation of the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies; and restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located. we do not have written agreements with any of our third-party manufacturing contractors. as a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. in fiscal 2011, our largest manufacturing contractor, who primarily produces its products in china and who we have worked with for the last seven years, accounted for the production of 30.5% of our finished products. our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, we use third-party agents to source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf. we do not have written agreements with any of our agents. as a result, any single agent could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. in fiscal 2011, our largest third-party agent, whose primary place of business is hong kong and who we have worked with for the last seven years, sourced approximately 19.5% of our purchases of finished goods. our inability to promptly replace agents that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality service in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.if our manufacturing contractors fail to use acceptable, ethical business practices, our business and reputation could suffer. we require our manufacturing contractors to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those three areas in order to promote ethical business practices, and our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our manufacturing contractors to determine compliance. however, we do not control our manufacturing contractors or their labor and other business practices. if one of our manufacturing contractors violates applicable labor or other laws, rules or regulations or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. we have a $100.0 million
