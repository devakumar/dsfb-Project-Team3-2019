    <th>risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including our financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock. if any of the following risks is realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. in that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our business and industry our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate. as a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors or securities analysts, which could cause our stock price to decline. our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including revenue related to the product mix that we sell, including the relative sales related to our platform and solutions and other factors which are outside of our control. if our quarterly revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including: the portion of our revenue attributable to software-as-a-service, or saas, and license versus hardware and other sales; fluctuations in demand, including due to seasonality, for our platform and solutions; changes in pricing by us in response to competitive pricing actions; our ability to increase, retain and incentivize the service providers that market, sell, install and support our platform and solutions; the ability of our hardware vendors to continue to manufacture high-quality products and to supply sufficient products to meet our demands; the timing and success of introductions of new solutions, products or upgrades by us or our competitors and the entrance of new competitors; changes in our business and pricing policies or those of our competitors; the ability to accurately forecast revenue as we generally rely upon our service provider network to generate new revenue; our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs of the hardware we purchase; competition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors; our ability to successfully manage any future acquisitions of businesses; issues related to introductions of new or improved products such as shortages of prior generation products or short-term decreased demand for next generation products; the amount and timing of expenditures, including those related to expanding our operations, increasing research and development, introducing new solutions or paying litigation expenses; the ability to effectively manage growth within existing and new markets domestically and abroad; 16 changes in the payment terms for our platform and solutions; the strength of regional, national and global economies; and the impact of natural disasters or manmade problems such as terrorism. due to the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed in this prospectus, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. you should not consider our recent revenue and adjusted ebitda growth or results of one quarter as indicative of our future performance.we may not sustain our growth rate and we may not be able to manage any future growth effectively. we have experienced significant growth in a short period of time. our revenue increased from $37.2 million in 2010 to $167.3 million in 2014. we do not expect to achieve similar growth rates in future periods. you should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance. if we are unable to maintain expected revenue growth in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of prior period revenue, our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline. our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our anticipated expansion and growth. to manage our growth successfully and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must effectively, among other things: maintain our relationships with existing service providers and add new service providers; increase our subscriber base and cross-sell additional solutions to our existing subscribers; add sales and marketing personnel; expand our international operations; and implement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls. we intend to increase our investment in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions and other areas to grow our business. we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect, which could adversely affect our operating results. if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new solutions or enhancements to our existing solutions and we may fail to satisfy subscriber and service provider requirements, maintain the quality of our solutions, execute on our business plan or respond to competitive pressures, which could result in our financial results suffering and a decline in our stock price.we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately. we increased our number of full-time employees from 165 to 253 to 400 at december31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. our revenue increased from $96.5 million in 2012 to $130.2 million in 2013 and to $167.3 million in 2014. our growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. we intend to 17 further expand our overall business, service provider network, subscriber base, headcount and operations. creating a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. we will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively. as such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross profit or operating expenses in any particular quarter. if we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our solutions may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract service providers and consumers.the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, broadband and security service providers and other managed service providers, are actively targeting the home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management markets. if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. we compete in several markets, including home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management. the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and competition may intensify in the future. our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including: our platform and solutions functionality, performance, ease of use, reliability, availability and cost effectiveness relative to that of our competitors products; our success in utilizing new and proprietary technologies to offer solutions and features previously not available in the marketplace; our success in identifying new markets, applications and technologies; our ability to attract and retain service providers; our name recognition and reputation; our ability to recruit software engineers and sales and marketing personnel; and our ability to protect our intellectual property. consumers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. in the event a consumer decides to evaluate a new home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring or energy management solution, the consumer may be more inclined to select one of our competitors whose product offerings are broader than those that we offer. our current primary competitors include providers of other technology platforms for the connected home, including icontrol networks, inc. and honeywell international inc., that sell to service providers such as cable operators and other home automation providers. in addition, our service providers compete with managed service providers, such as cable television, telephone and security companies like comcast corporation, at&t inc. and time warner cable inc., and providers of point products, including nest labs, inc. (acquired by google inc.), which offers a thermostat, and dropcam, inc. (acquired by nest labs, inc.), which offers video monitoring. because our service providers compete with these entities, we consider them competitive. for example, several cable and telecommunications companies have introduced home automation and security services packages, including interactive security services, which are competitive with our platform and solutions. in addition, we may compete with other large technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications 18 and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the broader connected home market. for example, apple, inc. introduced a feature in 2014 that allows some manufacturers devices to be controlled through a service in the ios operating system. most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have. we expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management companies as well as large technology companies. in addition, there may be new technologies that are introduced that reduce demand for our solutions or make them obsolete. our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenue and negatively affect our ability to grow our business.aggressive business tactics by our competitors may reduce our revenue. increased competition in the markets in which we compete may result in aggressive business tactics by our competitors, including: selling at a discount; offering products similar to our platform and solutions on a bundled basis at no charge; announcing competing products combined with extensive marketing efforts; providing financing incentives to consumers; and asserting intellectual property rights irrespective of the validity of the claims. our service providers may switch and offer the products and services of competing companies, which would adversely affect our sales and profitability. competition from other companies may also adversely affect our negotiations with service providers and suppliers, including, in some cases, requiring us to lower our prices. opportunities to take market share using innovative products, services and sales approaches may also attract new entrants to the field. we may not be able to compete successfully with the offerings and sales tactics of other companies, which could result in the loss of service providers offering our platform and solutions and, as a result, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. if we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or if our current or future competitors employ aggressive business tactics, including those described above, demand for our platform and solutions could decline, we could experience cancellations of our services to consumers, or we could be required to reduce our prices or increase our expenses.the proper and efficient functioning of our network operations centers and data back-up systems is central to our solutions. our solutions operate with a cloud-based architecture and we update our solutions regularly while our solutions are operating. if our solutions and/or upgrades fail to operate properly, our solutions could stop functioning for a period of time, which could put our users at risk. our ability to keep our business operating is highly dependent on the proper and efficient operation of our network operations centers and data back-up systems. although our network operations centers have back-up computer and power systems, if there is a catastrophic event, natural disaster, terrorist attacks, security breach or other extraordinary event, we may be unable to provide our subscribers with uninterrupted monitoring service. furthermore, because data back-up systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions 19 (including those due to equipment damage, power outages, human error, computer viruses, computer hacking, data corruption and a range of other hardware, software and network problems), we cannot guarantee that we will not experience data back-up failures in the future. a significant or large-scale malfunction or interruption of our network operations centers or data back-up systems could adversely affect our ability to keep our operations running efficiently. if a malfunction results in a wider or sustained disruption, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.we sell security and life safety solutions and if our solutions fail for any reason, we could be subject to liability and our business could suffer. we sell security and life safety solutions, which are designed to secure the safety of our subscribers and their residences or business. if these solutions fail for any reason, including due to defects in our software, a carrier outage, a failure of our network operating center, a failure on the part of our service providers or user error, we could be subject to liability for such failures and our business could suffer. our platform and solutions may contain undetected defects in the software, infrastructure, third-party components or processes. if our platform or solutions suffer from defects, we could experience harm to our branded reputation, claims by our subscribers or service providers or lost revenue during the period required to address the cause of the defects. we may find defects in new or upgraded solutions, resulting in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our platform and solutions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. since solutions that enable our platform are installed by our service providers, if they do not install or maintain such solutions correctly, our platform and solutions may not function properly. if the improper installation or maintenance of our platform and solutions leads to service failures after introduction of, or an upgrade to, our platform or a solution, we could experience harm to our branded reputation, claims by our subscribers or service providers or lost revenue during the period required to address the cause of the problem. further, we rely on our service providers to provide the primary source of support and ongoing service to our subscribers and, if our service providers fail to provide an adequate level of support and services to our subscribers, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. any defect in, or disruption to, our platform and solutions could cause consumers not to purchase additional solutions from us, prevent potential consumers from purchasing our platform and solutions or harm our reputation. although our contracts with our service providers limit our liability to our service providers for these defects, disruptions or errors, we nonetheless could be subject to litigation for actual or alleged losses to our service providers or our subscribers, which may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration, or to pay significant settlements or damages. defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly, divert management's attention and affect our ability to obtain or maintain liability insurance on acceptable terms and could harm our business. although we currently maintain some warranty reserves, we cannot assure you that these warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover future liabilities.we rely on our service provider network to acquire additional subscribers, and the inability of our service providers to attract additional subscribers or retain their current subscribers could adversely affect our operating results. substantially all of our revenue is generated through the sales of our platform and solutions by our service providers, and our service providers are responsible for subscriber acquisition, as well as providing customer service and technical support for our platform and solutions to the subscribers. we provide our service providers with specific training and programs to assist them in selling and providing 20 support for our platform and solutions, but we cannot assure that these steps will be effective. in addition, we rely on our service providers to sell our platform and solutions into new markets in the intelligent and connected home space. if our service providers are unsuccessful in marketing, selling, and supporting our platform and solutions, our operating results could be adversely affected. in order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and grow our revenues, we must effectively manage and grow relationships with our service providers. recruiting and retaining qualified service providers and training them in our technology and solutions requires significant time and resources. if we fail to maintain existing service providers or develop relationships with new service providers, our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected. in addition, to execute on our strategy to expand our sales internationally, we must develop relationships with service providers that sell into these markets. any of our service providers may choose to offer a product from one of our competitors instead of our platform and solutions, elect to develop their own competing solutions or simply discontinue their operations with us. for example, we entered into a license agreement in november 2013 with vivint, inc., or vivint, pursuant to which we granted a license to use the intellectual property associated with our connected home solutions. under the terms of this arrangement, vivint has transitioned from selling our solutions directly to its customers to selling its own home automation product to its new customers. we now generate revenue from a monthly fee charged to vivint on a per customer basis from sales of this service providers product; however, these monthly fees are less on a per customer basis than fees from our saas solutions. therefore, we receive less revenue on a per customer basis from vivint compared to our saas subscriber base, which may result in a lower revenue growth rate. we must also work to expand our network of service providers to ensure that we have sufficient geographic coverage and technical expertise to address new markets and technologies. while it is difficult to estimate the total number of available service providers in our markets, there are a finite number of service providers that are able to perform the types of technical installations required for our platform and solutions. in the event that we saturate the available service provider pool, or if market or other forces cause the available pool of service providers to decline, it may be increasingly difficult to grow our business. if we are unable to expand our network of service providers, our business could be harmed. as the consumers product and service options grow, it is important that we enhance our service provider footprint by broadening the expertise of our service providers, working with larger and more sophisticated service providers and expanding the mainstream solutions our service providers offer. if we do not succeed in this effort, our current and potential future service providers may be unable or unwilling to broaden their offerings to include our connected home solution, resulting in harm to our business.we receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of service providers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our major service providers would result in decreased revenue and profitability. our success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of service providers. we market and sell our platform and solutions through an all-channel assisted sales model and we derive substantially all of our revenue from these service providers. we generally enter into agreements with our service providers outlining the terms of our relationship, including service provider pricing commitments, installation, maintenance and support requirements, and our sales registration process for registering potential sales to subscribers. these contracts, including our contract with monitronics international, inc., typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year, and are terminable at the end of the initial term or renewal 21 terms without cause upon written notice to the other party. in some cases, these contracts provide the service provider with the right to terminate prior to the expiration of the term without cause upon 30 days written notice, or, in the case of certain termination events, the right to terminate the contract immediately. while we have developed a network of over 5,000 service providers to sell, install and support our platform and solutions, we receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of channel partners. during the years ended december31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, our 10 largest revenue service providers accounted for approximately 71.2%, 65.7% and 64.7% of our revenue. vivint represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2012, 2013 and 2014. monitronics international, inc. represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2012 and greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue in 2013 and 2014. united technologies corporation represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2014. we anticipate that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of service providers for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future and, in some cases, a portion of our revenue attributable to individual service providers may increase in the future. the loss of one or more key service providers, a reduction in sales through any major service providers or the inability or unwillingness of any of our major service providers to pay for our platform and solutions would reduce our revenue and could impair our profitability.we have relatively limited visibility regarding the consumers that ultimately purchase our solutions, and we often rely on information from third-party service providers to help us manage our business. if these service providers fail to provide timely or accurate information, our ability to quickly react to market changes and effectively manage our business may be harmed. we sell our solutions through service providers. these service providers work with consumers to design, install, update and maintain their connected home installations and manage the relationship with our subscribers. while we are able to track orders from service providers and have access to certain information about the configurations of their alarm.com systems that we receive through our platform, we also rely on service providers to provide us with information about consumer behavior, product and system feedback, consumer demographics and buying patterns. we use this channel sell-through data, along with other metrics, to forecast our revenue, assess consumer demand for our solution, develop new solutions, adjust pricing and make other strategic business decisions. channel sell-through data is subject to limitations due to collection methods and the third-party nature of the data and thus may not be complete or accurate. if we do not receive consumer information on a timely or accurate basis, or if we do not properly interpret this information, our ability to quickly react to market changes and effectively manage our business may be harmed.consumers may choose to adopt point products that provide control of discrete home functions rather than adopting our connected home platform. if we are unable to increase market awareness of the benefits of our unified solutions, our revenue may not continue to grow, or it may decline. many vendors have emerged, and may continue to emerge, to provide point products with advanced functionality for use in the home, such as a thermostat that can be controlled by an application on a smartphone. we expect more and more consumer electronic and consumer appliance products to be network-aware and connected each very likely to have its own smart device (phone or tablet) application. consumers may be attracted to the relatively low costs of these point products and the ability to expand their home control solution over time with minimal upfront costs, despite some of the disadvantages of this approach, may reduce demand for our connected home solutions. if so, our service providers may switch and offer the point products and services of competing companies, 22 which would adversely affect our sales and profitability. if a significant number of consumers in our target market choose to adopt point products rather than our connected home solutions, then our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve sustained growth or our business may decline.mergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and harm our results of operations. our industry is highly fragmented, and we believe it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or be acquired. in addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.we are dependent on our connected home solutions, and the lack of continued market acceptance of our connected home solutions would result in lower revenue. our connected home solutions account for substantially all of our revenue and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. as a result, our revenue could be reduced by: any decline in demand for our connected home solutions; the failure of our connected home solutions to achieve continued market acceptance; the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our connected home solutions; technological innovations or new communications standards that our connected home solutions does not address; and our inability to release enhanced versions of our connected home solutions on a timely basis. we are vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for internet-connected devices in general and interactive security systems in particular. if the market for connected home solutions grows more slowly than anticipated or if demand for connected home solutions does not grow as quickly as anticipated, whether as a result of competition, product obsolescence, technological change, unfavorable economic conditions, uncertain geopolitical environment, budgetary constraints of our consumers or other factors, we may not be able to continue to increase our revenue and earnings and our stock price would decline.a significant decline in our saas and license revenue renewal rate would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. we generally bill our service providers based on the number of subscribers they have on our platform and the features being utilized by subscribers on a monthly basis in advance. subscribers could elect to terminate our services in any given month. if our efforts and our service providers efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to retain them or sell additional functionality to them and, as a result, our revenue and ability to grow could be adversely affected. we track our saas and license revenue renewal rates on an annualized basis, as reflected in thesectionofthisprospectustitledmanagementsdiscussionandanalysiskeymetricssaasand 23 license revenue renewal rate. however, our service providers, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have three to five year service contracts with our subscribers. our saas and license revenue renewal rate is calculated across our entire subscriber base, including subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service providers.as a result, we may not be able to accurately predict future trends in renewals and the resulting churn. subscribers may choose not to renew their contracts for many reasons, including the belief that our service is not required for their needs or is otherwise not cost-effective, a desire to reduce discretionary spending, or a belief that our competitors services provide better value. additionally, our subscribers may not renew for reasons entirely out of our control, such as moving a residence or the dissolution of their business, which is particularly common for businesses. a significant increase in our churn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.if we are unable to develop new solutions, sell our platform and solutions into new markets or further penetrate our existing markets, our revenue may not grow as expected. our ability to increase sales will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our platform and solutions, introduce new solutions in a timely manner, sell into new markets and further penetrate our existing markets. the success of any enhancement or new solution or service depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of enhanced or new solutions, the ability to maintain and develop relationships with service providers, the ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel and the effectiveness of our marketing programs. any new product or service we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. any new markets into which we attem</th>

    <th>risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. our business could be harmed by any of these risks. the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. in assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this prospectus, including our financial statements and related notes.risks related to our business and industry the market for on-demand supply chain management solutions is at an early stage of development. if this market does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our revenues may decline or fail to grow and we may incur operating losses. we derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenues from providing on-demand supply chain management solutions to suppliers. the market for on-demand supply chain management solutions is in an early stage of development, and it is uncertain whether these solutions will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. our success will depend on the willingness of suppliers to accept our on-demand supply chain management solutions as an alternative to traditional licensed hardware and software solutions. some suppliers may be reluctant or unwilling to use our on-demand supply chain management solutions for a number of reasons, including existing investments in supply chain management technology. supply chain management functions traditionally have been performed using purchased or licensed hardware and software implemented by each supplier. because this traditional approach often requires significant initial investments to purchase the necessary technology and to establish systems that comply with retailers unique requirements, suppliers may be unwilling to abandon their current solutions for our on-demand supply chain management solutions. other factors that may limit market acceptance of our on-demand supply chain management solutions include: our ability to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction; our ability to maintain continuity of service for all users of our platform; the price, performance and availability of competing solutions;and our ability to assuage suppliers confidentiality concerns about information stored outside of their controlled computing environments. if suppliers do not perceive the benefits of our on-demand supply chain management solutions, or if suppliers are unwilling to accept our platform as an alternative to the traditional approach, the market for our solutions might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our revenues and growth prospects.we do not have long-term contracts with our recurring revenue customers, and our success therefore depends on our ability to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction and a strong reputation in the supply chain management industry. our contracts with our recurring revenue customers typically allow the customer to cancel the contract for any reason with 30days prior notice. our continued success therefore depends significantly on our ability to meet or exceed our recurring revenue customers expectations because most recurring revenue customers do not make long-term commitments to use our solutions. in addition, if our reputation in the supply chain management industry is harmed or diminished for any reason, our recurring revenue customers have the ability to terminate their relationship with us on short notice and seek alternative supply chain management solutions. if a significant number of recurring revenue customers seek to terminate their relationship with us, our business, results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected in a short period of time. continued economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue, lengthen our sales cycles and make it difficult for us to forecast operating results accurately. our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the health of retailers. economic weakness and constrained retail spending adversely affected revenue growth rates in late 2008 and similar circumstances may result in slower growth, or reductions, in revenues and gross profits in the future. we have experienced, and may experience in the future, reduced spending in our business due to the current financial turmoil affecting the u.s.and global economy, and other macroeconomic factors affecting spending behavior. uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. in addition, economic conditions or uncertainty may cause customers and potential customers to reduce or delay technology purchases, including purchases of our solutions. our sales cycle may lengthen if purchasing decisions are delayed as a result of uncertain information technology or development budgets or contract negotiations become more protracted or difficult as customers institute additional internal approvals for information technology purchases. delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our solutions, and consequently our results of operations, prospects and stock price.if we are unable to attract new customers, or sell additional solutions, or if our customers do not increase their use of our solutions, our revenue growth and profitability will be adversely affected. to increase our revenues and achieve and maintain profitability, we must regularly add new customers, sell additional solutions and our customers must increase their use of the solutions for which they currently subscribe. we intend to grow our business by hiring additional inside sales personnel, developing strategic relationships with resellers, including resellers that incorporate our applications in their offerings, and increasing our marketing activities. in addition, we derived more than 90% of our revenues from sales of our trading partner integration solution in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and have not yet received significant revenues from solutions and applications that we introduced in 2009. if we are unable to hire or retain quality sales personnel, convert companies that have been referred to us by our existing network into paying customers, ensure the effectiveness of our marketing programs, or if our existing or new customers do not perceive our solutions to be of sufficiently high value and quality, we might not be able to increase sales and our operating results will be adversely affected. in addition, if we fail to sell our new solutions to existing or new customers, we will not generate anticipated revenues from these solutions, our operating results will suffer and we might be unable to grow our revenues or achieve or maintain profitability.our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate in the future, which could result in volatility in our stock price. our quarterly revenues and results of operations have varied in the past and may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including the success of our new offerings such as our trading partner intelligence solution. if our quarterly revenues or results of operations fluctuate, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below and identified throughout this risk factors section in this prospectus: our ability to retain and increase sales to customers and attract new customers, including our ability to maintain and increase our number of recurring revenue customers; the timing and success of introductions of new solutions or upgrades by us or our competitors; the strength of the economy, in particular as it affects the retail sector; changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; competition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors; 9 the amount and timing of expenditures related to expanding our operations, research and development, or introducing new solutions; and changes in the payment terms for our solutions. due to the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this prospectus, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.we have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future. we began operating our supply chain management solution business in 1997. throughout most of our history, we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations. as of december31, 2009, we had an accumulated deficit of $65.7million. we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations. furthermore, as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. if our revenues do not grow to offset these increased expenses, we may not be profitable. we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. you should not consider recent revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. in fact, in future periods, we may not have any revenue growth, or our revenues could decline.our inability to adapt to rapid technological change could impair our ability to remain competitive. the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and evolving industry standards. our ability to attract new customers and increase revenues from customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate industry standards and to continue to enhance existing solutions or introduce or acquire new solutions on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments. the success of any enhancement or new solution depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancement or solution. any new solution we develop or acquire might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues. for example, we introduced our trading partner intelligence solution during 2009, but we have not yet received significant revenues from this solution. if any of our competitors implements new technologies before we are able to implement them, those competitors may be able to provide more effective solutions than ours at lower prices. any delay or failure in the introduction of new or enhanced solutions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.we may experience service failures or interruptions due to defects in the hardware, software, infrastructure, third party components or processes that comprise our existing or new solutions, any of which could adversely affect our business. technology solutions as complex as ours may contain undetected defects in the hardware, software, infrastructure, third party components or processes that are part of the solutions we provide. if these defects lead to service failures after introduction of a solution or an upgrade to the solution, we could experience delays or lost revenues during the period required to correct the cause of the defects. we cannot be certain that defects will not be found in new solutions or upgraded solutions, resulting in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. because customers use our on-demand supply chain management solutions for critical business processes, any defect in our solutions, any disruption to our solutions or any error in execution could cause recurring revenue customers to cancel their contracts with us, prevent potential customers from joining our network and harm our reputation. although most of our contracts with our customers limit our liability to our customers for these defects, disruptions or errors, we nonetheless could be subject to litigation for actual or alleged losses to our customers businesses, which may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration or to pay significant settlements or damages. we do not currently maintain any warranty reserves. defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert managements attention and could cause our business to suffer. 10 the insurers under our existing liability insurance policy could deny coverage of a future claim that results from an error or defect in our technology or a resulting disruption in our solutions, or our existing liability insurance might not be adequate to cover all of the damages and other costs of such a claim. moreover, we cannot assure you that our current liability insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. the successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds our insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our liability insurance policy, including an increase in premiums or imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. even if we succeed in litigation with respect to a claim, we are likely to incur substantial costs and our managements attention will be diverted from our operations.interruptions or delays from third-party data centers could impair the delivery of our solutions and our business could suffer. we use two third-party data centers, located in minneapolis and saint paul, minnesota, to conduct our operations. all of our solutions reside on hardware that we own or lease and operate in these locations. our operations depend on the protection of the equipment and information we store in these third-party centers against damage or service interruptions that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters, war, criminal act, military action, terrorist attack and other similar events beyond our control. a prolonged service disruption affecting our solutions for any of the foregoing reasons could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose recurring revenue customers or otherwise adversely affect our business. we may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the data centers we use. our on-demand supply chain management solutions are accessed by a large number of customers at the same time. as we continue to expand the number of our customers and solutions available to our customers, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. in addition, the failure of our third-party data centers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in our solutions or impede our ability to scale our operations. in the event that our data center arrangements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in our solutions as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services.a failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers information could expose us to litigation, materially damage our reputation and harm our business, and the costs of preventing such a failure could adversely affect our results of operations. our business involves the collection and use of confidential information of our customers and their trading partners. we cannot assure you that our efforts to protect this confidential information will be successful. if any compromise of this information security were to occur, we could be subject to legal claims and government action, experience an adverse effect on our reputation and need to incur significant additional costs to protect against similar information security breaches in the future, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. in addition, because of the critical nature of data security, any perceived breach of our security measures could cause existing or potential customers not to use our solutions and could harm our reputation.evolving regulation of the internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts, which may adversely affect our financial condition. as internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. we are particularly sensitive to these risks because the internet is a critical component of our on-demand business model. for example, we believe that increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for solutions accessed via the internet and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our clients via the internet. 11 in addition, taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may be imposed. any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet-based services, which could harm our business.if we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be adversely affected. we believe that proprietary technology is essential to establishing and maintaining our leadership position. we seek to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality, non-compete and nondisclosure agreements, trademarks, domain names and other measures, some of which afford only limited protection. we do not have any patents, patent applications or registered copyrights. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar or superior technology or design around our intellectual property. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states. intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.an assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses and our business might be harmed. the internet supply chain management and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. as we seek to extend our solutions, we could be constrained by the intellectual property rights of others. we might not prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation. defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. if our solutions violate any third-party proprietary rights, we could be required to withdraw those solutions from the market, re-develop those solutions or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. any efforts to re-develop our solutions, obtain licenses from third parties on favorable terms or license a substitute technology might not be successful and, in any case, might substantially increase our costs and harm our business, financial condition and operating results. withdrawal of any of our solutions from the market might harm our business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, we incorporate open source software into our platform. given the nature of open source software, third parties might assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of certain open source software programs. the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by u.s.or foreign courts, and there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. in that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our solutions, to re-develop our solutions or to discontinue sales of our solutions, or to release our proprietary software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could adversely affect our business.we rely on third party hardware and software that could take a significant time to replace or upgrade. we rely on hardware and software licensed from third parties to offer our on-demand supply chain management solutions. this hardware and software, as well as maintenance rights for this hardware and software, may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. if we lose the 12 right to use or upgrade any of these licenses, our customers could experience delays or be unable to access our solutions until we can obtain and integrate equivalent technology. there might not always be commercially reasonable hardware or software alternatives to the third-party hardware and software that we currently license. any such alternatives could be more difficult or costly to replace than the third-party hardware and software we currently license, and integration of the alternatives into our platform could require significant work and substantial time and resources. any delays or failures associated with our platform could injure our reputation with customers and potential customers and result in an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.our strategy includes pursuing acquisitions and our potential inability to successfully integrate newly-acquired companies or businesses may adversely affect our financial results. we believe part of our growth will be driven by acquisitions of other companies or their businesses. if we complete acquisitions, we face many risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions. these risks include: incurring significantly higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses; failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired company or business; disrupting our ongoing business; dissipating our management resources; failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies;and impairing relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management. fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions. to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to any acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. future acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital needs, and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly results of operations. acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings.our ability to use u.s. net operating loss carryforwards might be limited. as of december31, 2009, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $53.4million for u.s.federal tax purposes. these loss carryforwards expire between 2010 and 2029. to the extent these net operating loss carryforwards are available, we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. section382 of the u.s.internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. due to changes in ownership, some of our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited. in addition, future changes in ownership could further limit the availability of our net operating loss carryforwards. our ability to utilize the current net operating loss carryforwards also might be limited by the issuance of common stock in this offering. to the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited, our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, which could result in lower profits.the markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and our failure to compete successfully would make it difficult for us to add and retain customers and would reduce or impede the growth of our business. the markets for supply chain management solutions are increasingly competitive and global. we expect competition to increase in the future both from existing competitors and new companies that may enter our 13 markets. increased competition could result in pricing pressure, reduced sales, lower margins or the failure of our solutions to achieve or maintain broad market acceptance. we face competition from: software-as-a-service providers that deliver business-to-business information systems using a multi-tenant approach; traditional on-premise software providers;and managed service providers that combine traditional on-premise software with professional information technology services. to remain competitive, we will need to invest continuously in software development, marketing, customer service and support and product delivery infrastructure. however, we cannot assure you that new or established competitors will not offer solutions that are superior to or lower in price than ours. we may not have sufficient resources to continue the investments in all areas of software development and marketing needed to maintain our competitive position. in addition, some of our competitors are better capitalized than us, which may provide them with an advantage in developing, marketing or servicing new solutions. increased competition could reduce our market share, revenues and operating margins, increase our costs of operations and otherwise adversely affect our business.mergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could harm our operating results. our industry is highly fragmented, and we believe it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or will be acquired. in addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.if we fail to retain our chief executive officer and other key personnel, our business would be harmed and we might not be able to implement our business plan successfully. given the complex nature of the technology on which our business is based and the speed with which such technology advances, our future success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and sales personnel. in particular, archie c. black, our chief executive officer and president, kimberly k. nelson, our executive vice president and chief financial officer, james j. frome, our executive vice president and chief strategy officer, michael j. gray, our executive vice president of operations, and david j. novak,jr., our executive vice president of business development, are critical to the management of our business and operations. competition for talented personnel is intense, and we cannot be certain that we can retain our managerial, technical and sales personnel or that we can attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.our continued growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we will not be able to implement our business plan successfully. we have experienced a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations. to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, it will place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. if our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business would be harmed. to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and 14 procedures. the additional headcount we are adding will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. if we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan.our failure to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 or to prevent or detect material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements in the future could result in inaccurate financial reporting, or could otherwise harm our business. we are required to comply with the internal control evaluation and certification requirements of section404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 by no later than the end of our 2011 fiscal year. we are in the process of determining whether our existing internal controls over financial reporting systems are compliant with section404. this process may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. to the extent that we are not currently in compliance with section404, we may be required to implement new internal control procedures and re-evaluate our financial reporting. we may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses as well as increased independent auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. further, we may need to hire additional qualified personnel in order for us to comply with section404. if we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in our being unable to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our independent auditors, which could have a negative impact on our stock price. in connection with preparing the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we identified an error in our prior years financial statements. this error related</th>

    <th>risk factors before you invest in our common stock, you should understand the high degree of risk involved. you should consider carefully the following risks and other information in this prospectus, including the historical financial statements and related notes, before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our businessour cellular therapy product candidates are at an early stage of development, and if we are not able to successfully develop and commercialize them, we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations. our cellular therapy product candidates are in the early stages of development. in particular, our lead stem cell product candidate, cb001, has only recently entered phasei clinical trials. cb001 has not previously been studied in humans, and we have no safety or efficacy data on this product candidate yet. while stem cell therapy is an accepted medical procedure for the regeneration of the blood and immune systems for patients with cancer and other serious diseases a procedure for which we are developing cb001 stem cell populations expanded using our selective amplification technology have not yet been shown to be safe or effective for such treatments. additionally, there has been only limited use of stem cells in treating cardiac disease in clinical trial settings, which is an additional indication we are targeting. as a result, there is substantial uncertainty about the effectiveness of cb001 for its target indication and about whether our program targeting another indication will be successful. we expect that none of our cellular therapy product candidates will be commercially available for at least three years, if at all. we will need to devote significant additional research and development, financial resources and personnel to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals. we may discover that manipulation of stem cells using selective amplification changes the biological characteristics of stem cells. for this or other reasons, therapeutic products developed with our stem cell expansion technology may fail to work as intended, even in areas where stem cell therapy is already in use. this may result from the failure of our products to: properly engraft into the recipients body in the desired manner; provide the intended therapeutic benefits;or achieve benefits that are better or equal to existing therapies. while our selective amplification technology has shown successful results in preclinical research, those results were not obtained in humans and may not be indicative of results we may encounter in future preclinical studies or clinical trials. since none of our product candidates have progressed past phasei clinical trials, we cannot determine whether our preclinical testing methodologies are predictive of clinical safety or efficacy. as we obtain results from further preclinical or clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay preclinical studies or clinical trials for certain product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates. we may also change the indication being pursued for a particular product candidate or otherwise revise the development plan for that candidate. moreover, product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical or initial clinical testing. if our product candidates do not prove to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials, we will not obtain the required regulatory approvals for our technologies or product candidates. even if we are successful in developing and gaining regulatory approval for cb001, we do not expect to obtain approval before 2008. we may not be able to sustain our current level of revenues or our recent growth rates. revenues from our umbilical cord blood preservation and storage products have grown significantly over the past several years, from $7.1million in fiscal 2001, to $20.1million in fiscal 2002, to $30.9million in fiscal 2003. we believe that this is a result of our increased marketing efforts and from increased awareness by the public generally of the concept of cord blood banking. we may not be able in the future, however, to sustain this growth rate nor the current level of viacords revenues. principal factors that may adversely affect our revenue, such as litigation, competition from other private cord blood banks or risks of reputational damage, are described elsewhere in this risk factor section in more detail. if we are unable to sustain our revenues, we may need to reduce our product candidate development activities or raise additional funds earlier than anticipated or on unfavorable terms.we expect to continue to incur operating losses and may never become profitable. we have generated operating losses since our inception. as of september30, 2004, we had cumulative net losses of approximately $151.1million. these losses have resulted principally from the costs of our research and development activities, which have totaled approximately $84.9million since our inception. we expect our losses to increase for the next several years as we make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. in particular, we expect that our rate of spending will accelerate over the next several years as a result of increased costs and expenses associated with clinical trials, including our current phasei trial for cb001, submissions for regulatory approvals and potential commercialization of our products, including the build out of commercial scale manufacturing facilities. furthermore, we expect to make additional investments in the near term in our viacell reproductive health franchise, as we seek to expand geographically our viacord product offering and develop our viacyte product candidate. our ability to become profitable will depend on many factors, including our ability to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, obtain necessary regulatory approvals and successfully commercialize products. we cannot assure you that we will ever become profitable.we and several other defendants, representing a majority of the industry, are defendants in lawsuits alleging infringement of patents relating to our viacord umbilical cord stem cell cryopreservation business. if we are not able to resolve the suits favorably, we could be permanently enjoined from further engaging in this business, which would result in the loss of the current source of almost all of our revenues, or we may be required to pay a royalty. we were sued for infringing two patents relating to our viacord umbilical cord stem cell cryopreservation business after we rejected the initial requests of the plaintiff, pharmastem therapeutics,inc., seeking a license arrangement because we believe that we do not infringe these patents and that they are invalid. in october 2003, the jury in this case in the united states district court for the district of delaware ruled that we and the several other defendants, who represent a majority of the family cord blood preservation industry, willfully infringed the two patents, which relate to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood. in september 2004, the federal district court overturned the jury verdict on one of the two patents in litigation and vacated the verdict and granted a new trial on the issues of infringement and damages (if any) concerning the second patent. the federal district court also denied pharmastems motions seeking a permanent injunction against all of the defendants in the suit to enjoin our further conducting our business, as well as its motion requesting that the damages against us be increased up to three times the amount of the award for past infringement and to include legal fees and interest. we had requested that the court find the pharmastem patents invalid and unenforceable as a matter of law, but the court denied this request. on december14, 2004, the federal district court reversed its post-trial ruling granting a new trial on the issues of infringement and damages (if any) of the second patent and overturned the jurys verdict of infringement of that patent. in its september and december 2004 decisions, the judge found that there was no legally sufficient basis for finding infringement of either pharmastem patent. on january 6, 2005, pharmastem filed a notice of appeal and a motion to expedite the appeal of the courts decision. with respect to the patent for which a new trial had beengranted, pharmastem filed a motion on october5, 2004 with the court for a preliminary injunction. the court denied that motion on december14, 2004 when it overturned the jury verdict on that patent. in august 2004, the us patent and trademark office (us pto) ordered the re-examination of both of these patents based on the prior art submitted. if the uspto does not find the claims of the patents to be unpatentable and if an appeal in the litigation is not resolved favorably to us, we could be enjoined from further engaging in our umbilical cord stem cell cryopreservation business. in such case, we will not be able to conduct this business unless pharmastem grants a license to us. in such event, pharmastem would be under no legal obligation to grant us a license or to do so on economically reasonable terms, and previously informed us that it would not do so at all after october15, 2004. if it becomes necessary, but we are unable, to obtain a license, or are unable to obtain a license on economically reasonable terms, we will not be able to further engage in our umbilical cord stem cell cryopreservation business. if we cannot continue our cord blood preservation business, that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as we would no longer have access to the current source of almost all of our revenues. we had revenues of approximately $30.9million in 2003 from viacord sales. the judgment in the case, which was subsequently overturned, was entered against us for approximately $2.9million relating to past infringement, based on 6.125% royalties on our revenue from the storage of umbilical cord blood since april 2000. if it becomes necessary, and we are able, to obtain a license from pharmastem, it may be at a royalty rate greater than 6.125% or on terms less favorable than pharmastem has granted to other cord blood banks. for example, we understand pharmastem has licensed other cord blood banks under its patents for royalty rates of 15%. we have also been sued again by pharmastem in federal district court in massachusetts on two different but related patents, as have several others in the family cord blood preservation industry, albeit in separate actions in other courts, and many of the same risks are present in that litigation as in the original delaware litigation. we have filed a motion to consolidate the massachusetts case with six other actions in a single proceeding in the district of delaware. we also filed a motion to stay the massachusetts litigation pending a ruling on our motion to consolidate the cases, which was granted on january18, 2005. on january7, 2005, pharmastem filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the massachusetts litigation. if this motion is granted, we could be enjoined from collecting and storing cord blood that had not been collected as of the date the injunction is issued while the case is litigated and thereafter if we lose the case. we believe that the issues presented in pharmastems motion are substantially the same as the issues presented in the delaware litigation and, while no assurance can be given, we believe that pharmastems motion will be denied. we may enter into settlement negotiations with pharmastem regarding our litigation with pharmastem. we cannot predict whether any such negotiations would lead to a settlement of these lawsuits or what the terms or timing of any such settlement might be, if it occurs at all. for a fuller discussion of the pharmastem litigation, see the section entitled business legal proceedings.we may not be able to raise additional funds necessary to fund our operations. as of september30, 2004, we had approximately $34.1million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. in order to develop and bring our stem cell product candidates to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, preclinical testing and clinical trials. while we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, together with the net proceeds of this offering, will be sufficient to fund our current operations for the next two to three years, we may need or want to raise additional funding sooner, particularly if our business or operations change in a manner that consume available resources more rapidly than we anticipate. we expect to attempt to raise additional funds well in advance of completely depleting our available funds. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the level of cash flows from our umbilical cord blood preservation activities; the scope and results of our research and development programs; the scope and results of our clinical trials, particularly those involving cb001, which is currently in a phasei trial; the timing of and the costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, which could be more lengthy or complex than obtaining approval for a new conventional drug, given the fdas relatively little experience with cellular-based therapeutics; the costs of building and operating our manufacturing facilities, both in the near term to support our clinical activities, and also in anticipation of growing our commercialization activities; funds spent in connection with acquisitions of related technologies or businesses, including contingent payments that may be made in connection with our acquisition of kourion therapeutics; the costs of maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including litigation costs and liabilities; our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements and obtain milestones, royalties and other payments from collaborators;and costs associated with expanding our viacell reproductive health franchise abroad, for which we do not have currently the degree of infrastructure that we have in the united states. we may seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and public or private financings. additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. if we obtain additional capital through collaborative arrangements, these arrangements may require us to relinquish greater rights to our technologies or product candidates than we might otherwise have done. if we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, or securities convertible into equity, further dilution to our then existing stockholders will result. if we raise additional capital through the incurrence of debt, our business may be affected by the amount of leverage we incur. for instance, such borrowings could subject us to covenants restricting our business activities, servicing interest would divert funds that would otherwise be available to support research and development, clinical or commercialization activities, and holders of debt instruments would have rights and privileges senior to those of our equity investors. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.if the potential of stem cell therapy to treat serious diseases is not realized, the value of our selective amplification technology and our development programs could be significantly reduced. the potential of stem cell therapy to treat serious diseases is currently being explored by us and other companies. it has not been proven in clinical trials that stem cell therapy will be an effective treatment for diseases other than those currently addressed by hematopoietic stem cell transplants. no stem cell products have been successfully developed and commercialized to date, and none has received regulatory approval in the united states or internationally. stem cell therapy may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval or commercial use. if the potential of stem cell therapy to treat serious diseases is not realized, the value of our selective amplification technology and our development programs could be significantly reduced.we cannot market and sell cb001 or our other product candidates in the united states or in other countries if we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or licensure. we cannot sell cb001, or other cellular product candidates, until regulatory agencies grant marketing approval, or licensure. the process of obtaining regulatory approval is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. it is likely to take threeto fiveyears or more to obtain the required regulatory approvals for our lead stem cell product candidate, cb001, or we may never gain necessary approvals. any difficulties that we encounter in obtaining regulatory approval may have a substantial adverse impact on our operations and cause our stock price to decline significantly. to obtain regulatory approvals in the united states for cb001, for instance, we must, among other requirements, complete carefully controlled and well-designed clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate to the us food& drug administration, or fda, that cb001 is safe, effective and potent for each disease for which we seek approval. several factors could prevent completion or cause significant delay of these trials, including an inability to enroll the required number of patients or failure to demonstrate adequately thatcb001 is safe, effective and potent for use in humans. negative or inconclusive results from or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause the clinical trial to be repeated or a program to be terminated, even if other studies or trials relating to the program are successful. the fda can place a clinical trial on hold if, among other reasons, it finds that patients enrolled in the trial are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. if safety concerns develop, we or the fda could stop our trials before completion. although we do not have particular reasons to expect unusual delays or a need to terminate our clinical trials, to date, some participants in our cb001 clinical trial have experienced serious adverse events, two of which have been determined to be possibly related to cb001. a serious adverse event is an event that results in significant medical consequences, such as hospitalization, disability or death and must be reported to the fda. while we believe that the serious adverse event profiles we have observed are consistent with those of the disease conditions of patients in the trial and with those associated with stem cell and bone marrow transplants generally, we cannot assure you that safety concerns regarding cb001 will not develop. we have only recently initiated our first clinical trial for cb001, and thus have no clinical trial history for this product candidate. indeed, the fda has relatively little experience with therapeutics based on cellular medicine generally. as a result, the pathway to regulatory approval for cb001 may be more complex and lengthy than for approval of a new conventional drug. similarly, to obtain approval to market our stem cell products outside of the united states, we will need to submit clinical data concerning our products and receive regulatory approval from governmental agencies, which in certain countries includes approval of the price we intend to charge for our product. we may encounter delays or rejections if changes occur in regulatory agency policies during the period in which we develop a product candidate or during the period required for review of any application for regulatory agency approval. if we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use of cb001 or other products under development, we will not be able to commercialize such products, and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.our cell preservation activities are subject to regulations that may impose significant costs and restrictions on us. cord blood preservation. our viacord cord blood preservation product is currently subject to fda regulations requiring infectious disease testing. we have registered with the fda as a cord blood preservation service, listed our products with the fda, and we are subject to fda inspection. in addition, the fda has recently adopted new good tissue practice (gtp)regulations that establish a comprehensive regulatory program for human cellular and tissue-based products and finalized rules for donor eligibility and that will become effective in may of 2005. we believe that we comply with existing regulatory requirements and will be in compliance with the new gtp regulations as recently adopted. however, we may not be able to maintain this compliance or comply with future regulatory requirements that may be imposed on us, including product standards that may be developed. moreover, the cost of compliance with government regulations may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. regulation of our cord blood preservation services in foreign jurisdictions is still evolving. consistent with industry practice, the viacord cord blood collection kits have not been cleared as a medical device. the fda could at any time require us to obtain medical device premarket application (pma)approval or 510(k)clearance for the collection kits, or new drug application supplement (snda) approval for a drug component of the kits. securing any necessary medical device 510(k)clearance or pmaapproval for the cord blood collection kits, or snda approval for a drug component of the kits, may involve the submission of a substantial volume of data and may require a lengthy substantive review. the fda also could require that we cease distributing the collection kits and require us to obtain medical device 510(k)clearance or pmaapproval for the kits or sndaapproval of a drug component of the kits prior to further distribution of the kits. of the states in which we provide cord blood banking services, only new jersey, newyork, maryland, kentucky, illinois and pennsylvania currently require that cord blood banks be licensed or registered. we are currently licensed or registered to operate in new jersey, newyork, kentucky and illinois and we believe that we will be able to comply with the license and registration requirements inmaryland and pennsylvania which we recently identified. if other states adopt requirements for the licensing or registration of cord blood preservation services, we would have to obtain licenses or register to continue providing services in those states. oocyte cryopreservation. there are no established precedents for us and international regulation of oocyte cryopreservation. we anticipate that in the unites states cryopreservation of oocytes will be regulated similarly to viacords family umbilical cord blood cryopreservation product. we also anticipate that some of the components used in this product will be regulated as medical devices under a 510(k)clearance mechanism. for instance, prior to marketing this product, our media supplier will be required to obtain 510(k)clearance for the technology we have licensed for use in the cryopreservation of oocytes. the 510(k)clearance process typically takes three to twelve months from the time of submission to being able to market a product, but can take significantly longer. in november of 2004, our media supplier submitted a 510(k) to the fda for clearance of the oocyte cryopreservation media. in january of 2005, our media supplier informed us that they had received a letter from the fda that included the following information: a statement that our media supplier will need to conduct a clinical study that produces pregnancy and birth rates data to support the application;and a request that various additional information be submitted, including stability, toxicity testing, biocompatibility and labeling information. clinical data were not included in the original 510(k) application. our media supplier intends to address the fda letter and submit existing, published third party clinical data and to submit additional information to the pending 510(k) application. we believe that the existing, published clinical data may be sufficient to support 510(k) clearance of the media; however, it is likely that a new clinical trial will be required which could substantially delay 510(k) clearance and our launch of viacyte. in addition, although the letter from the fda did not suggest that any other approval process would be required other than the 510(k) process, the fda could at any time determine, for instance, that: cryopreservation of oocytes requires biologic marketing approval, entailing an investigational new drug (ind)application to conduct clinical trials and extensive clinical and nonclinical data and a biologics license application (bla)for market approval; and/or components used to cryopreserve the oocytes require pmas. either scenario would substantially lengthen our planned developmental timeline for and substantially increase the costs of commercializing this service. we have not investigated the regulations for the cryopreservation of oocytes in foreign jurisdictions.we depend on patents and other proprietary rights that may fail to protect our business. our success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, technologies and trade secrets. we own or have exclusive licenses to five us patents and two international patents. we also own or have exclusive licenses to 13pending applications in the united states and 52pending applications in foreign countries. our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. the patent position of biotechnology companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has recently been the subject of much litigation. neither the uspatent and trademark office nor the courts have a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many biotechnology patents. the claims of our existing uspatents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may not offer significant protection of our selective amplification and other technologies. our patents on selective amplification, in particular, are quite broad in that they cover selection and amplification of any targeted cell population. while selective amplification is covered by issued patents and we are not aware of any challenges, patents with broad claims tend to be more vulnerable to challenge by other parties than patents with more narrowly written claims. our patent applications covering unrestricted somatic stem cells (usscs) claim these cells as well as their use in the treatment of many diseases. it is possible that these cells could be covered by other patents or patentapplications which identify, isolate or use the same cells by other markers, although we are not aware of any. third parties may challenge, narrow, invalidate or circumvent any patents we obtain based on these applications. furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent. for instance, our patents on selective amplification issued in 1997 and will expire in 2014. to the extent our product candidates based on that technology are not commercialized significantly ahead of this date, or to the extent we have no other patent protection on such products, those products would not be protected by patents beyond 2014. without patent protection, those products might have to compete with identical products by competitors. in an effort to protect our unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how as trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements. these agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. in addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.cb001 and our other cellular product candidates represent new forms of therapy or products that the marketplace may not accept. even if we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for cb001 or other stem cell therapy products, the market may not accept them. other than hematopoietic stem cell transplants, stem cell therapy is not currently a commonly used procedure. similarly, our oocyte cryopreservation product candidate, if developed and cleared for commercial use, may not be accepted by the market. market demand for our products will depend primarily on acceptance by patients, physicians, medical centers and third party payers. commercial acceptance will be dependent upon several factors, including: the number and relative efficacy of products that compete with our product; our ability to supply a sufficient amount of our product to meet demand; our ability to build and maintain, or access through third parties, a capable sales force; our ability to successfully fund launch costs;and our ability to obtain insurance coverage and reimbursement for our cellular therapy products.our success will depend in part on establishing and maintaining effective strategic partnerships and collaborations. a key aspect of our business strategy is to establish strategic relationships in order to gain access to technology and critical raw materials, to expand or complement our research, development or commercialization capabilities, or to reduce the cost of developing or commercializing products on our own. we currently have strategic relationships with amgen, genzyme and massachusetts general hospital. while we are currently in discussions with a number of companies, universities, research institutions, public cord blood banks and others to establish additional relationships and collaborations, we may not reach definitive agreements with any of them. even if we enter into these arrangements, we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms. furthermore, these arrangements may require us to grant certain rights to third parties, including exclusive marketing rights to one or more products, or may have other terms that are burdensome to us, and may involve the acquisition of our securities. our partners may decide to develop alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others. if any of our partners terminate their relationship with us orfail to perform their obligations in a timely manner, the development or commercialization of our technology and potential products may be substantially delayed.third parties may own or control patents or patent applications that are infringed by our technologies or product candidates. ou</th>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including our financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock. if any of the following risks is realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. in that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our business and industry our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate. as a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors or securities analysts, which could cause our stock price to decline. our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including revenue related to the product mix that we sell, including the relative sales related to our platform and solutions and other factors which are outside of our control. if our quarterly revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including: the portion of our revenue attributable to software-as-a-service, or saas, and license versus hardware and other sales; fluctuations in demand, including due to seasonality, for our platform and solutions; changes in pricing by us in response to competitive pricing actions; our ability to increase, retain and incentivize the service providers that market, sell, install and support our platform and solutions; the ability of our hardware vendors to continue to manufacture high-quality products and to supply sufficient products to meet our demands; the timing and success of introductions of new solutions, products or upgrades by us or our competitors and the entrance of new competitors; changes in our business and pricing policies or those of our competitors; the ability to accurately forecast revenue as we generally rely upon our service provider network to generate new revenue; our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs of the hardware we purchase; competition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors; our ability to successfully manage any future acquisitions of businesses; issues related to introductions of new or improved products such as shortages of prior generation products or short-term decreased demand for next generation products; the amount and timing of expenditures, including those related to expanding our operations, increasing research and development, introducing new solutions or paying litigation expenses; the ability to effectively manage growth within existing and new markets domestically and abroad; 16 changes in the payment terms for our platform and solutions; the strength of regional, national and global economies; and the impact of natural disasters or manmade problems such as terrorism. due to the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed in this prospectus, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. you should not consider our recent revenue and adjusted ebitda growth or results of one quarter as indicative of our future performance.we may not sustain our growth rate and we may not be able to manage any future growth effectively. we have experienced significant growth in a short period of time. our revenue increased from $37.2 million in 2010 to $167.3 million in 2014. we do not expect to achieve similar growth rates in future periods. you should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance. if we are unable to maintain expected revenue growth in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of prior period revenue, our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline. our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our anticipated expansion and growth. to manage our growth successfully and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must effectively, among other things: maintain our relationships with existing service providers and add new service providers; increase our subscriber base and cross-sell additional solutions to our existing subscribers; add sales and marketing personnel; expand our international operations; and implement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls. we intend to increase our investment in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions and other areas to grow our business. we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect, which could adversely affect our operating results. if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new solutions or enhancements to our existing solutions and we may fail to satisfy subscriber and service provider requirements, maintain the quality of our solutions, execute on our business plan or respond to competitive pressures, which could result in our financial results suffering and a decline in our stock price.we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately. we increased our number of full-time employees from 165 to 253 to 400 at december31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. our revenue increased from $96.5 million in 2012 to $130.2 million in 2013 and to $167.3 million in 2014. our growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. we intend to 17 further expand our overall business, service provider network, subscriber base, headcount and operations. creating a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. we will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively. as such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross profit or operating expenses in any particular quarter. if we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our solutions may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract service providers and consumers.the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, broadband and security service providers and other managed service providers, are actively targeting the home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management markets. if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. we compete in several markets, including home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management. the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and competition may intensify in the future. our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including: our platform and solutions functionality, performance, ease of use, reliability, availability and cost effectiveness relative to that of our competitors products; our success in utilizing new and proprietary technologies to offer solutions and features previously not available in the marketplace; our success in identifying new markets, applications and technologies; our ability to attract and retain service providers; our name recognition and reputation; our ability to recruit software engineers and sales and marketing personnel; and our ability to protect our intellectual property. consumers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. in the event a consumer decides to evaluate a new home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring or energy management solution, the consumer may be more inclined to select one of our competitors whose product offerings are broader than those that we offer. our current primary competitors include providers of other technology platforms for the connected home, including icontrol networks, inc. and honeywell international inc., that sell to service providers such as cable operators and other home automation providers. in addition, our service providers compete with managed service providers, such as cable television, telephone and security companies like comcast corporation, at&t inc. and time warner cable inc., and providers of point products, including nest labs, inc. (acquired by google inc.), which offers a thermostat, and dropcam, inc. (acquired by nest labs, inc.), which offers video monitoring. because our service providers compete with these entities, we consider them competitive. for example, several cable and telecommunications companies have introduced home automation and security services packages, including interactive security services, which are competitive with our platform and solutions. in addition, we may compete with other large technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications 18 and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the broader connected home market. for example, apple, inc. introduced a feature in 2014 that allows some manufacturers devices to be controlled through a service in the ios operating system. most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have. we expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management companies as well as large technology companies. in addition, there may be new technologies that are introduced that reduce demand for our solutions or make them obsolete. our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenue and negatively affect our ability to grow our business.aggressive business tactics by our competitors may reduce our revenue. increased competition in the markets in which we compete may result in aggressive business tactics by our competitors, including: selling at a discount; offering products similar to our platform and solutions on a bundled basis at no charge; announcing competing products combined with extensive marketing efforts; providing financing incentives to consumers; and asserting intellectual property rights irrespective of the validity of the claims. our service providers may switch and offer the products and services of competing companies, which would adversely affect our sales and profitability. competition from other companies may also adversely affect our negotiations with service providers and suppliers, including, in some cases, requiring us to lower our prices. opportunities to take market share using innovative products, services and sales approaches may also attract new entrants to the field. we may not be able to compete successfully with the offerings and sales tactics of other companies, which could result in the loss of service providers offering our platform and solutions and, as a result, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. if we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or if our current or future competitors employ aggressive business tactics, including those described above, demand for our platform and solutions could decline, we could experience cancellations of our services to consumers, or we could be required to reduce our prices or increase our expenses.the proper and efficient functioning of our network operations centers and data back-up systems is central to our solutions. our solutions operate with a cloud-based architecture and we update our solutions regularly while our solutions are operating. if our solutions and/or upgrades fail to operate properly, our solutions could stop functioning for a period of time, which could put our users at risk. our ability to keep our business operating is highly dependent on the proper and efficient operation of our network operations centers and data back-up systems. although our network operations centers have back-up computer and power systems, if there is a catastrophic event, natural disaster, terrorist attacks, security breach or other extraordinary event, we may be unable to provide our subscribers with uninterrupted monitoring service. furthermore, because data back-up systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions 19 (including those due to equipment damage, power outages, human error, computer viruses, computer hacking, data corruption and a range of other hardware, software and network problems), we cannot guarantee that we will not experience data back-up failures in the future. a significant or large-scale malfunction or interruption of our network operations centers or data back-up systems could adversely affect our ability to keep our operations running efficiently. if a malfunction results in a wider or sustained disruption, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.we sell security and life safety solutions and if our solutions fail for any reason, we could be subject to liability and our business could suffer. we sell security and life safety solutions, which are designed to secure the safety of our subscribers and their residences or business. if these solutions fail for any reason, including due to defects in our software, a carrier outage, a failure of our network operating center, a failure on the part of our service providers or user error, we could be subject to liability for such failures and our business could suffer. our platform and solutions may contain undetected defects in the software, infrastructure, third-party components or processes. if our platform or solutions suffer from defects, we could experience harm to our branded reputation, claims by our subscribers or service providers or lost revenue during the period required to address the cause of the defects. we may find defects in new or upgraded solutions, resulting in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our platform and solutions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. since solutions that enable our platform are installed by our service providers, if they do not install or maintain such solutions correctly, our platform and solutions may not function properly. if the improper installation or maintenance of our platform and solutions leads to service failures after introduction of, or an upgrade to, our platform or a solution, we could experience harm to our branded reputation, claims by our subscribers or service providers or lost revenue during the period required to address the cause of the problem. further, we rely on our service providers to provide the primary source of support and ongoing service to our subscribers and, if our service providers fail to provide an adequate level of support and services to our subscribers, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. any defect in, or disruption to, our platform and solutions could cause consumers not to purchase additional solutions from us, prevent potential consumers from purchasing our platform and solutions or harm our reputation. although our contracts with our service providers limit our liability to our service providers for these defects, disruptions or errors, we nonetheless could be subject to litigation for actual or alleged losses to our service providers or our subscribers, which may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration, or to pay significant settlements or damages. defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly, divert management's attention and affect our ability to obtain or maintain liability insurance on acceptable terms and could harm our business. although we currently maintain some warranty reserves, we cannot assure you that these warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover future liabilities.we rely on our service provider network to acquire additional subscribers, and the inability of our service providers to attract additional subscribers or retain their current subscribers could adversely affect our operating results. substantially all of our revenue is generated through the sales of our platform and solutions by our service providers, and our service providers are responsible for subscriber acquisition, as well as providing customer service and technical support for our platform and solutions to the subscribers. we provide our service providers with specific training and programs to assist them in selling and providing 20 support for our platform and solutions, but we cannot assure that these steps will be effective. in addition, we rely on our service providers to sell our platform and solutions into new markets in the intelligent and connected home space. if our service providers are unsuccessful in marketing, selling, and supporting our platform and solutions, our operating results could be adversely affected. in order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and grow our revenues, we must effectively manage and grow relationships with our service providers. recruiting and retaining qualified service providers and training them in our technology and solutions requires significant time and resources. if we fail to maintain existing service providers or develop relationships with new service providers, our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected. in addition, to execute on our strategy to expand our sales internationally, we must develop relationships with service providers that sell into these markets. any of our service providers may choose to offer a product from one of our competitors instead of our platform and solutions, elect to develop their own competing solutions or simply discontinue their operations with us. for example, we entered into a license agreement in november 2013 with vivint, inc., or vivint, pursuant to which we granted a license to use the intellectual property associated with our connected home solutions. under the terms of this arrangement, vivint has transitioned from selling our solutions directly to its customers to selling its own home automation product to its new customers. we now generate revenue from a monthly fee charged to vivint on a per customer basis from sales of this service providers product; however, these monthly fees are less on a per customer basis than fees from our saas solutions. therefore, we receive less revenue on a per customer basis from vivint compared to our saas subscriber base, which may result in a lower revenue growth rate. we must also work to expand our network of service providers to ensure that we have sufficient geographic coverage and technical expertise to address new markets and technologies. while it is difficult to estimate the total number of available service providers in our markets, there are a finite number of service providers that are able to perform the types of technical installations required for our platform and solutions. in the event that we saturate the available service provider pool, or if market or other forces cause the available pool of service providers to decline, it may be increasingly difficult to grow our business. if we are unable to expand our network of service providers, our business could be harmed. as the consumers product and service options grow, it is important that we enhance our service provider footprint by broadening the expertise of our service providers, working with larger and more sophisticated service providers and expanding the mainstream solutions our service providers offer. if we do not succeed in this effort, our current and potential future service providers may be unable or unwilling to broaden their offerings to include our connected home solution, resulting in harm to our business.we receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of service providers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our major service providers would result in decreased revenue and profitability. our success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of service providers. we market and sell our platform and solutions through an all-channel assisted sales model and we derive substantially all of our revenue from these service providers. we generally enter into agreements with our service providers outlining the terms of our relationship, including service provider pricing commitments, installation, maintenance and support requirements, and our sales registration process for registering potential sales to subscribers. these contracts, including our contract with monitronics international, inc., typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year, and are terminable at the end of the initial term or renewal 21 terms without cause upon written notice to the other party. in some cases, these contracts provide the service provider with the right to terminate prior to the expiration of the term without cause upon 30 days written notice, or, in the case of certain termination events, the right to terminate the contract immediately. while we have developed a network of over 5,000 service providers to sell, install and support our platform and solutions, we receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of channel partners. during the years ended december31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, our 10 largest revenue service providers accounted for approximately 71.2%, 65.7% and 64.7% of our revenue. vivint represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2012, 2013 and 2014. monitronics international, inc. represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2012 and greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue in 2013 and 2014. united technologies corporation represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2014. we anticipate that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of service providers for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future and, in some cases, a portion of our revenue attributable to individual service providers may increase in the future. the loss of one or more key service providers, a reduction in sales through any major service providers or the inability or unwillingness of any of our major service providers to pay for our platform and solutions would reduce our revenue and could impair our profitability.we have relatively limited visibility regarding the consumers that ultimately purchase our solutions, and we often rely on information from third-party service providers to help us manage our business. if these service providers fail to provide timely or accurate information, our ability to quickly react to market changes and effectively manage our business may be harmed. we sell our solutions through service providers. these service providers work with consumers to design, install, update and maintain their connected home installations and manage the relationship with our subscribers. while we are able to track orders from service providers and have access to certain information about the configurations of their alarm.com systems that we receive through our platform, we also rely on service providers to provide us with information about consumer behavior, product and system feedback, consumer demographics and buying patterns. we use this channel sell-through data, along with other metrics, to forecast our revenue, assess consumer demand for our solution, develop new solutions, adjust pricing and make other strategic business decisions. channel sell-through data is subject to limitations due to collection methods and the third-party nature of the data and thus may not be complete or accurate. if we do not receive consumer information on a timely or accurate basis, or if we do not properly interpret this information, our ability to quickly react to market changes and effectively manage our business may be harmed.consumers may choose to adopt point products that provide control of discrete home functions rather than adopting our connected home platform. if we are unable to increase market awareness of the benefits of our unified solutions, our revenue may not continue to grow, or it may decline. many vendors have emerged, and may continue to emerge, to provide point products with advanced functionality for use in the home, such as a thermostat that can be controlled by an application on a smartphone. we expect more and more consumer electronic and consumer appliance products to be network-aware and connected each very likely to have its own smart device (phone or tablet) application. consumers may be attracted to the relatively low costs of these point products and the ability to expand their home control solution over time with minimal upfront costs, despite some of the disadvantages of this approach, may reduce demand for our connected home solutions. if so, our service providers may switch and offer the point products and services of competing companies, 22 which would adversely affect our sales and profitability. if a significant number of consumers in our target market choose to adopt point products rather than our connected home solutions, then our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve sustained growth or our business may decline.mergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and harm our results of operations. our industry is highly fragmented, and we believe it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or be acquired. in addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.we are dependent on our connected home solutions, and the lack of continued market acceptance of our connected home solutions would result in lower revenue. our connected home solutions account for substantially all of our revenue and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. as a result, our revenue could be reduced by: any decline in demand for our connected home solutions; the failure of our connected home solutions to achieve continued market acceptance; the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our connected home solutions; technological innovations or new communications standards that our connected home solutions does not address; and our inability to release enhanced versions of our connected home solutions on a timely basis. we are vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for internet-connected devices in general and interactive security systems in particular. if the market for connected home solutions grows more slowly than anticipated or if demand for connected home solutions does not grow as quickly as anticipated, whether as a result of competition, product obsolescence, technological change, unfavorable economic conditions, uncertain geopolitical environment, budgetary constraints of our consumers or other factors, we may not be able to continue to increase our revenue and earnings and our stock price would decline.a significant decline in our saas and license revenue renewal rate would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. we generally bill our service providers based on the number of subscribers they have on our platform and the features being utilized by subscribers on a monthly basis in advance. subscribers could elect to terminate our services in any given month. if our efforts and our service providers efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to retain them or sell additional functionality to them and, as a result, our revenue and ability to grow could be adversely affected. we track our saas and license revenue renewal rates on an annualized basis, as reflected in thesectionofthisprospectustitledmanagementsdiscussionandanalysiskeymetricssaasand 23 license revenue renewal rate. however, our service providers, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have three to five year service contracts with our subscribers. our saas and license revenue renewal rate is calculated across our entire subscriber base, including subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service providers.as a result, we may not be able to accurately predict future trends in renewals and the resulting churn. subscribers may choose not to renew their contracts for many reasons, including the belief that our service is not required for their needs or is otherwise not cost-effective, a desire to reduce discretionary spending, or a belief that our competitors services provide better value. additionally, our subscribers may not renew for reasons entirely out of our control, such as moving a residence or the dissolution of their business, which is particularly common for businesses. a significant increase in our churn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.if we are unable to develop new solutions, sell our platform and solutions into new markets or further penetrate our existing markets, our revenue may not grow as expected. our ability to increase sales will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our platform and solutions, introduce new solutions in a timely manner, sell into new markets and further penetrate our existing markets. the success of any enhancement or new solution or service depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of enhanced or new solutions, the ability to maintain and develop relationships with service providers, the ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel and the effectiveness of our marketing programs. any new product or service we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. any new markets into which we attem</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. our business could be harmed by any of these risks. the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. in assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this prospectus, including our financial statements and related notes.risks related to our business and industry the market for on-demand supply chain management solutions is at an early stage of development. if this market does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our revenues may decline or fail to grow and we may incur operating losses. we derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenues from providing on-demand supply chain management solutions to suppliers. the market for on-demand supply chain management solutions is in an early stage of development, and it is uncertain whether these solutions will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. our success will depend on the willingness of suppliers to accept our on-demand supply chain management solutions as an alternative to traditional licensed hardware and software solutions. some suppliers may be reluctant or unwilling to use our on-demand supply chain management solutions for a number of reasons, including existing investments in supply chain management technology. supply chain management functions traditionally have been performed using purchased or licensed hardware and software implemented by each supplier. because this traditional approach often requires significant initial investments to purchase the necessary technology and to establish systems that comply with retailers unique requirements, suppliers may be unwilling to abandon their current solutions for our on-demand supply chain management solutions. other factors that may limit market acceptance of our on-demand supply chain management solutions include: our ability to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction; our ability to maintain continuity of service for all users of our platform; the price, performance and availability of competing solutions;and our ability to assuage suppliers confidentiality concerns about information stored outside of their controlled computing environments. if suppliers do not perceive the benefits of our on-demand supply chain management solutions, or if suppliers are unwilling to accept our platform as an alternative to the traditional approach, the market for our solutions might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our revenues and growth prospects.we do not have long-term contracts with our recurring revenue customers, and our success therefore depends on our ability to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction and a strong reputation in the supply chain management industry. our contracts with our recurring revenue customers typically allow the customer to cancel the contract for any reason with 30days prior notice. our continued success therefore depends significantly on our ability to meet or exceed our recurring revenue customers expectations because most recurring revenue customers do not make long-term commitments to use our solutions. in addition, if our reputation in the supply chain management industry is harmed or diminished for any reason, our recurring revenue customers have the ability to terminate their relationship with us on short notice and seek alternative supply chain management solutions. if a significant number of recurring revenue customers seek to terminate their relationship with us, our business, results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected in a short period of time. continued economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue, lengthen our sales cycles and make it difficult for us to forecast operating results accurately. our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the health of retailers. economic weakness and constrained retail spending adversely affected revenue growth rates in late 2008 and similar circumstances may result in slower growth, or reductions, in revenues and gross profits in the future. we have experienced, and may experience in the future, reduced spending in our business due to the current financial turmoil affecting the u.s.and global economy, and other macroeconomic factors affecting spending behavior. uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. in addition, economic conditions or uncertainty may cause customers and potential customers to reduce or delay technology purchases, including purchases of our solutions. our sales cycle may lengthen if purchasing decisions are delayed as a result of uncertain information technology or development budgets or contract negotiations become more protracted or difficult as customers institute additional internal approvals for information technology purchases. delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our solutions, and consequently our results of operations, prospects and stock price.if we are unable to attract new customers, or sell additional solutions, or if our customers do not increase their use of our solutions, our revenue growth and profitability will be adversely affected. to increase our revenues and achieve and maintain profitability, we must regularly add new customers, sell additional solutions and our customers must increase their use of the solutions for which they currently subscribe. we intend to grow our business by hiring additional inside sales personnel, developing strategic relationships with resellers, including resellers that incorporate our applications in their offerings, and increasing our marketing activities. in addition, we derived more than 90% of our revenues from sales of our trading partner integration solution in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and have not yet received significant revenues from solutions and applications that we introduced in 2009. if we are unable to hire or retain quality sales personnel, convert companies that have been referred to us by our existing network into paying customers, ensure the effectiveness of our marketing programs, or if our existing or new customers do not perceive our solutions to be of sufficiently high value and quality, we might not be able to increase sales and our operating results will be adversely affected. in addition, if we fail to sell our new solutions to existing or new customers, we will not generate anticipated revenues from these solutions, our operating results will suffer and we might be unable to grow our revenues or achieve or maintain profitability.our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate in the future, which could result in volatility in our stock price. our quarterly revenues and results of operations have varied in the past and may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including the success of our new offerings such as our trading partner intelligence solution. if our quarterly revenues or results of operations fluctuate, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below and identified throughout this risk factors section in this prospectus: our ability to retain and increase sales to customers and attract new customers, including our ability to maintain and increase our number of recurring revenue customers; the timing and success of introductions of new solutions or upgrades by us or our competitors; the strength of the economy, in particular as it affects the retail sector; changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; competition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors; 9 the amount and timing of expenditures related to expanding our operations, research and development, or introducing new solutions; and changes in the payment terms for our solutions. due to the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this prospectus, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.we have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future. we began operating our supply chain management solution business in 1997. throughout most of our history, we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations. as of december31, 2009, we had an accumulated deficit of $65.7million. we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations. furthermore, as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. if our revenues do not grow to offset these increased expenses, we may not be profitable. we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. you should not consider recent revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. in fact, in future periods, we may not have any revenue growth, or our revenues could decline.our inability to adapt to rapid technological change could impair our ability to remain competitive. the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and evolving industry standards. our ability to attract new customers and increase revenues from customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate industry standards and to continue to enhance existing solutions or introduce or acquire new solutions on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments. the success of any enhancement or new solution depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancement or solution. any new solution we develop or acquire might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues. for example, we introduced our trading partner intelligence solution during 2009, but we have not yet received significant revenues from this solution. if any of our competitors implements new technologies before we are able to implement them, those competitors may be able to provide more effective solutions than ours at lower prices. any delay or failure in the introduction of new or enhanced solutions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.we may experience service failures or interruptions due to defects in the hardware, software, infrastructure, third party components or processes that comprise our existing or new solutions, any of which could adversely affect our business. technology solutions as complex as ours may contain undetected defects in the hardware, software, infrastructure, third party components or processes that are part of the solutions we provide. if these defects lead to service failures after introduction of a solution or an upgrade to the solution, we could experience delays or lost revenues during the period required to correct the cause of the defects. we cannot be certain that defects will not be found in new solutions or upgraded solutions, resulting in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. because customers use our on-demand supply chain management solutions for critical business processes, any defect in our solutions, any disruption to our solutions or any error in execution could cause recurring revenue customers to cancel their contracts with us, prevent potential customers from joining our network and harm our reputation. although most of our contracts with our customers limit our liability to our customers for these defects, disruptions or errors, we nonetheless could be subject to litigation for actual or alleged losses to our customers businesses, which may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration or to pay significant settlements or damages. we do not currently maintain any warranty reserves. defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert managements attention and could cause our business to suffer. 10 the insurers under our existing liability insurance policy could deny coverage of a future claim that results from an error or defect in our technology or a resulting disruption in our solutions, or our existing liability insurance might not be adequate to cover all of the damages and other costs of such a claim. moreover, we cannot assure you that our current liability insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. the successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds our insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our liability insurance policy, including an increase in premiums or imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. even if we succeed in litigation with respect to a claim, we are likely to incur substantial costs and our managements attention will be diverted from our operations.interruptions or delays from third-party data centers could impair the delivery of our solutions and our business could suffer. we use two third-party data centers, located in minneapolis and saint paul, minnesota, to conduct our operations. all of our solutions reside on hardware that we own or lease and operate in these locations. our operations depend on the protection of the equipment and information we store in these third-party centers against damage or service interruptions that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters, war, criminal act, military action, terrorist attack and other similar events beyond our control. a prolonged service disruption affecting our solutions for any of the foregoing reasons could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose recurring revenue customers or otherwise adversely affect our business. we may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the data centers we use. our on-demand supply chain management solutions are accessed by a large number of customers at the same time. as we continue to expand the number of our customers and solutions available to our customers, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. in addition, the failure of our third-party data centers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in our solutions or impede our ability to scale our operations. in the event that our data center arrangements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in our solutions as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services.a failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers information could expose us to litigation, materially damage our reputation and harm our business, and the costs of preventing such a failure could adversely affect our results of operations. our business involves the collection and use of confidential information of our customers and their trading partners. we cannot assure you that our efforts to protect this confidential information will be successful. if any compromise of this information security were to occur, we could be subject to legal claims and government action, experience an adverse effect on our reputation and need to incur significant additional costs to protect against similar information security breaches in the future, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. in addition, because of the critical nature of data security, any perceived breach of our security measures could cause existing or potential customers not to use our solutions and could harm our reputation.evolving regulation of the internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts, which may adversely affect our financial condition. as internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. we are particularly sensitive to these risks because the internet is a critical component of our on-demand business model. for example, we believe that increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for solutions accessed via the internet and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our clients via the internet. 11 in addition, taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may be imposed. any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet-based services, which could harm our business.if we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be adversely affected. we believe that proprietary technology is essential to establishing and maintaining our leadership position. we seek to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality, non-compete and nondisclosure agreements, trademarks, domain names and other measures, some of which afford only limited protection. we do not have any patents, patent applications or registered copyrights. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar or superior technology or design around our intellectual property. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states. intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.an assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses and our business might be harmed. the internet supply chain management and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. as we seek to extend our solutions, we could be constrained by the intellectual property rights of others. we might not prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation. defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. if our solutions violate any third-party proprietary rights, we could be required to withdraw those solutions from the market, re-develop those solutions or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. any efforts to re-develop our solutions, obtain licenses from third parties on favorable terms or license a substitute technology might not be successful and, in any case, might substantially increase our costs and harm our business, financial condition and operating results. withdrawal of any of our solutions from the market might harm our business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, we incorporate open source software into our platform. given the nature of open source software, third parties might assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of certain open source software programs. the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by u.s.or foreign courts, and there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. in that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our solutions, to re-develop our solutions or to discontinue sales of our solutions, or to release our proprietary software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could adversely affect our business.we rely on third party hardware and software that could take a significant time to replace or upgrade. we rely on hardware and software licensed from third parties to offer our on-demand supply chain management solutions. this hardware and software, as well as maintenance rights for this hardware and software, may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. if we lose the 12 right to use or upgrade any of these licenses, our customers could experience delays or be unable to access our solutions until we can obtain and integrate equivalent technology. there might not always be commercially reasonable hardware or software alternatives to the third-party hardware and software that we currently license. any such alternatives could be more difficult or costly to replace than the third-party hardware and software we currently license, and integration of the alternatives into our platform could require significant work and substantial time and resources. any delays or failures associated with our platform could injure our reputation with customers and potential customers and result in an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.our strategy includes pursuing acquisitions and our potential inability to successfully integrate newly-acquired companies or businesses may adversely affect our financial results. we believe part of our growth will be driven by acquisitions of other companies or their businesses. if we complete acquisitions, we face many risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions. these risks include: incurring significantly higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses; failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired company or business; disrupting our ongoing business; dissipating our management resources; failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies;and impairing relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management. fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions. to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to any acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. future acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital needs, and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly results of operations. acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings.our ability to use u.s. net operating loss carryforwards might be limited. as of december31, 2009, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $53.4million for u.s.federal tax purposes. these loss carryforwards expire between 2010 and 2029. to the extent these net operating loss carryforwards are available, we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. section382 of the u.s.internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. due to changes in ownership, some of our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited. in addition, future changes in ownership could further limit the availability of our net operating loss carryforwards. our ability to utilize the current net operating loss carryforwards also might be limited by the issuance of common stock in this offering. to the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited, our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, which could result in lower profits.the markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and our failure to compete successfully would make it difficult for us to add and retain customers and would reduce or impede the growth of our business. the markets for supply chain management solutions are increasingly competitive and global. we expect competition to increase in the future both from existing competitors and new companies that may enter our 13 markets. increased competition could result in pricing pressure, reduced sales, lower margins or the failure of our solutions to achieve or maintain broad market acceptance. we face competition from: software-as-a-service providers that deliver business-to-business information systems using a multi-tenant approach; traditional on-premise software providers;and managed service providers that combine traditional on-premise software with professional information technology services. to remain competitive, we will need to invest continuously in software development, marketing, customer service and support and product delivery infrastructure. however, we cannot assure you that new or established competitors will not offer solutions that are superior to or lower in price than ours. we may not have sufficient resources to continue the investments in all areas of software development and marketing needed to maintain our competitive position. in addition, some of our competitors are better capitalized than us, which may provide them with an advantage in developing, marketing or servicing new solutions. increased competition could reduce our market share, revenues and operating margins, increase our costs of operations and otherwise adversely affect our business.mergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could harm our operating results. our industry is highly fragmented, and we believe it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or will be acquired. in addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.if we fail to retain our chief executive officer and other key personnel, our business would be harmed and we might not be able to implement our business plan successfully. given the complex nature of the technology on which our business is based and the speed with which such technology advances, our future success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and sales personnel. in particular, archie c. black, our chief executive officer and president, kimberly k. nelson, our executive vice president and chief financial officer, james j. frome, our executive vice president and chief strategy officer, michael j. gray, our executive vice president of operations, and david j. novak,jr., our executive vice president of business development, are critical to the management of our business and operations. competition for talented personnel is intense, and we cannot be certain that we can retain our managerial, technical and sales personnel or that we can attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.our continued growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we will not be able to implement our business plan successfully. we have experienced a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations. to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, it will place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. if our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business would be harmed. to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and 14 procedures. the additional headcount we are adding will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. if we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan.our failure to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 or to prevent or detect material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements in the future could result in inaccurate financial reporting, or could otherwise harm our business. we are required to comply with the internal control evaluation and certification requirements of section404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 by no later than the end of our 2011 fiscal year. we are in the process of determining whether our existing internal controls over financial reporting systems are compliant with section404. this process may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. to the extent that we are not currently in compliance with section404, we may be required to implement new internal control procedures and re-evaluate our financial reporting. we may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses as well as increased independent auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. further, we may need to hire additional qualified personnel in order for us to comply with section404. if we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in our being unable to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our independent auditors, which could have a negative impact on our stock price. in connection with preparing the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, we identified an error in our prior years financial statements. this error related</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors before you invest in our common stock, you should understand the high degree of risk involved. you should consider carefully the following risks and other information in this prospectus, including the historical financial statements and related notes, before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our businessour cellular therapy product candidates are at an early stage of development, and if we are not able to successfully develop and commercialize them, we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations. our cellular therapy product candidates are in the early stages of development. in particular, our lead stem cell product candidate, cb001, has only recently entered phasei clinical trials. cb001 has not previously been studied in humans, and we have no safety or efficacy data on this product candidate yet. while stem cell therapy is an accepted medical procedure for the regeneration of the blood and immune systems for patients with cancer and other serious diseases a procedure for which we are developing cb001 stem cell populations expanded using our selective amplification technology have not yet been shown to be safe or effective for such treatments. additionally, there has been only limited use of stem cells in treating cardiac disease in clinical trial settings, which is an additional indication we are targeting. as a result, there is substantial uncertainty about the effectiveness of cb001 for its target indication and about whether our program targeting another indication will be successful. we expect that none of our cellular therapy product candidates will be commercially available for at least three years, if at all. we will need to devote significant additional research and development, financial resources and personnel to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals. we may discover that manipulation of stem cells using selective amplification changes the biological characteristics of stem cells. for this or other reasons, therapeutic products developed with our stem cell expansion technology may fail to work as intended, even in areas where stem cell therapy is already in use. this may result from the failure of our products to: properly engraft into the recipients body in the desired manner; provide the intended therapeutic benefits;or achieve benefits that are better or equal to existing therapies. while our selective amplification technology has shown successful results in preclinical research, those results were not obtained in humans and may not be indicative of results we may encounter in future preclinical studies or clinical trials. since none of our product candidates have progressed past phasei clinical trials, we cannot determine whether our preclinical testing methodologies are predictive of clinical safety or efficacy. as we obtain results from further preclinical or clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay preclinical studies or clinical trials for certain product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates. we may also change the indication being pursued for a particular product candidate or otherwise revise the development plan for that candidate. moreover, product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical or initial clinical testing. if our product candidates do not prove to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials, we will not obtain the required regulatory approvals for our technologies or product candidates. even if we are successful in developing and gaining regulatory approval for cb001, we do not expect to obtain approval before 2008. we may not be able to sustain our current level of revenues or our recent growth rates. revenues from our umbilical cord blood preservation and storage products have grown significantly over the past several years, from $7.1million in fiscal 2001, to $20.1million in fiscal 2002, to $30.9million in fiscal 2003. we believe that this is a result of our increased marketing efforts and from increased awareness by the public generally of the concept of cord blood banking. we may not be able in the future, however, to sustain this growth rate nor the current level of viacords revenues. principal factors that may adversely affect our revenue, such as litigation, competition from other private cord blood banks or risks of reputational damage, are described elsewhere in this risk factor section in more detail. if we are unable to sustain our revenues, we may need to reduce our product candidate development activities or raise additional funds earlier than anticipated or on unfavorable terms.we expect to continue to incur operating losses and may never become profitable. we have generated operating losses since our inception. as of september30, 2004, we had cumulative net losses of approximately $151.1million. these losses have resulted principally from the costs of our research and development activities, which have totaled approximately $84.9million since our inception. we expect our losses to increase for the next several years as we make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. in particular, we expect that our rate of spending will accelerate over the next several years as a result of increased costs and expenses associated with clinical trials, including our current phasei trial for cb001, submissions for regulatory approvals and potential commercialization of our products, including the build out of commercial scale manufacturing facilities. furthermore, we expect to make additional investments in the near term in our viacell reproductive health franchise, as we seek to expand geographically our viacord product offering and develop our viacyte product candidate. our ability to become profitable will depend on many factors, including our ability to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, obtain necessary regulatory approvals and successfully commercialize products. we cannot assure you that we will ever become profitable.we and several other defendants, representing a majority of the industry, are defendants in lawsuits alleging infringement of patents relating to our viacord umbilical cord stem cell cryopreservation business. if we are not able to resolve the suits favorably, we could be permanently enjoined from further engaging in this business, which would result in the loss of the current source of almost all of our revenues, or we may be required to pay a royalty. we were sued for infringing two patents relating to our viacord umbilical cord stem cell cryopreservation business after we rejected the initial requests of the plaintiff, pharmastem therapeutics,inc., seeking a license arrangement because we believe that we do not infringe these patents and that they are invalid. in october 2003, the jury in this case in the united states district court for the district of delaware ruled that we and the several other defendants, who represent a majority of the family cord blood preservation industry, willfully infringed the two patents, which relate to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood. in september 2004, the federal district court overturned the jury verdict on one of the two patents in litigation and vacated the verdict and granted a new trial on the issues of infringement and damages (if any) concerning the second patent. the federal district court also denied pharmastems motions seeking a permanent injunction against all of the defendants in the suit to enjoin our further conducting our business, as well as its motion requesting that the damages against us be increased up to three times the amount of the award for past infringement and to include legal fees and interest. we had requested that the court find the pharmastem patents invalid and unenforceable as a matter of law, but the court denied this request. on december14, 2004, the federal district court reversed its post-trial ruling granting a new trial on the issues of infringement and damages (if any) of the second patent and overturned the jurys verdict of infringement of that patent. in its september and december 2004 decisions, the judge found that there was no legally sufficient basis for finding infringement of either pharmastem patent. on january 6, 2005, pharmastem filed a notice of appeal and a motion to expedite the appeal of the courts decision. with respect to the patent for which a new trial had beengranted, pharmastem filed a motion on october5, 2004 with the court for a preliminary injunction. the court denied that motion on december14, 2004 when it overturned the jury verdict on that patent. in august 2004, the us patent and trademark office (us pto) ordered the re-examination of both of these patents based on the prior art submitted. if the uspto does not find the claims of the patents to be unpatentable and if an appeal in the litigation is not resolved favorably to us, we could be enjoined from further engaging in our umbilical cord stem cell cryopreservation business. in such case, we will not be able to conduct this business unless pharmastem grants a license to us. in such event, pharmastem would be under no legal obligation to grant us a license or to do so on economically reasonable terms, and previously informed us that it would not do so at all after october15, 2004. if it becomes necessary, but we are unable, to obtain a license, or are unable to obtain a license on economically reasonable terms, we will not be able to further engage in our umbilical cord stem cell cryopreservation business. if we cannot continue our cord blood preservation business, that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as we would no longer have access to the current source of almost all of our revenues. we had revenues of approximately $30.9million in 2003 from viacord sales. the judgment in the case, which was subsequently overturned, was entered against us for approximately $2.9million relating to past infringement, based on 6.125% royalties on our revenue from the storage of umbilical cord blood since april 2000. if it becomes necessary, and we are able, to obtain a license from pharmastem, it may be at a royalty rate greater than 6.125% or on terms less favorable than pharmastem has granted to other cord blood banks. for example, we understand pharmastem has licensed other cord blood banks under its patents for royalty rates of 15%. we have also been sued again by pharmastem in federal district court in massachusetts on two different but related patents, as have several others in the family cord blood preservation industry, albeit in separate actions in other courts, and many of the same risks are present in that litigation as in the original delaware litigation. we have filed a motion to consolidate the massachusetts case with six other actions in a single proceeding in the district of delaware. we also filed a motion to stay the massachusetts litigation pending a ruling on our motion to consolidate the cases, which was granted on january18, 2005. on january7, 2005, pharmastem filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the massachusetts litigation. if this motion is granted, we could be enjoined from collecting and storing cord blood that had not been collected as of the date the injunction is issued while the case is litigated and thereafter if we lose the case. we believe that the issues presented in pharmastems motion are substantially the same as the issues presented in the delaware litigation and, while no assurance can be given, we believe that pharmastems motion will be denied. we may enter into settlement negotiations with pharmastem regarding our litigation with pharmastem. we cannot predict whether any such negotiations would lead to a settlement of these lawsuits or what the terms or timing of any such settlement might be, if it occurs at all. for a fuller discussion of the pharmastem litigation, see the section entitled business legal proceedings.we may not be able to raise additional funds necessary to fund our operations. as of september30, 2004, we had approximately $34.1million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. in order to develop and bring our stem cell product candidates to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, preclinical testing and clinical trials. while we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, together with the net proceeds of this offering, will be sufficient to fund our current operations for the next two to three years, we may need or want to raise additional funding sooner, particularly if our business or operations change in a manner that consume available resources more rapidly than we anticipate. we expect to attempt to raise additional funds well in advance of completely depleting our available funds. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the level of cash flows from our umbilical cord blood preservation activities; the scope and results of our research and development programs; the scope and results of our clinical trials, particularly those involving cb001, which is currently in a phasei trial; the timing of and the costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, which could be more lengthy or complex than obtaining approval for a new conventional drug, given the fdas relatively little experience with cellular-based therapeutics; the costs of building and operating our manufacturing facilities, both in the near term to support our clinical activities, and also in anticipation of growing our commercialization activities; funds spent in connection with acquisitions of related technologies or businesses, including contingent payments that may be made in connection with our acquisition of kourion therapeutics; the costs of maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including litigation costs and liabilities; our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements and obtain milestones, royalties and other payments from collaborators;and costs associated with expanding our viacell reproductive health franchise abroad, for which we do not have currently the degree of infrastructure that we have in the united states. we may seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and public or private financings. additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. if we obtain additional capital through collaborative arrangements, these arrangements may require us to relinquish greater rights to our technologies or product candidates than we might otherwise have done. if we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, or securities convertible into equity, further dilution to our then existing stockholders will result. if we raise additional capital through the incurrence of debt, our business may be affected by the amount of leverage we incur. for instance, such borrowings could subject us to covenants restricting our business activities, servicing interest would divert funds that would otherwise be available to support research and development, clinical or commercialization activities, and holders of debt instruments would have rights and privileges senior to those of our equity investors. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.if the potential of stem cell therapy to treat serious diseases is not realized, the value of our selective amplification technology and our development programs could be significantly reduced. the potential of stem cell therapy to treat serious diseases is currently being explored by us and other companies. it has not been proven in clinical trials that stem cell therapy will be an effective treatment for diseases other than those currently addressed by hematopoietic stem cell transplants. no stem cell products have been successfully developed and commercialized to date, and none has received regulatory approval in the united states or internationally. stem cell therapy may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval or commercial use. if the potential of stem cell therapy to treat serious diseases is not realized, the value of our selective amplification technology and our development programs could be significantly reduced.we cannot market and sell cb001 or our other product candidates in the united states or in other countries if we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or licensure. we cannot sell cb001, or other cellular product candidates, until regulatory agencies grant marketing approval, or licensure. the process of obtaining regulatory approval is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. it is likely to take threeto fiveyears or more to obtain the required regulatory approvals for our lead stem cell product candidate, cb001, or we may never gain necessary approvals. any difficulties that we encounter in obtaining regulatory approval may have a substantial adverse impact on our operations and cause our stock price to decline significantly. to obtain regulatory approvals in the united states for cb001, for instance, we must, among other requirements, complete carefully controlled and well-designed clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate to the us food& drug administration, or fda, that cb001 is safe, effective and potent for each disease for which we seek approval. several factors could prevent completion or cause significant delay of these trials, including an inability to enroll the required number of patients or failure to demonstrate adequately thatcb001 is safe, effective and potent for use in humans. negative or inconclusive results from or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause the clinical trial to be repeated or a program to be terminated, even if other studies or trials relating to the program are successful. the fda can place a clinical trial on hold if, among other reasons, it finds that patients enrolled in the trial are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. if safety concerns develop, we or the fda could stop our trials before completion. although we do not have particular reasons to expect unusual delays or a need to terminate our clinical trials, to date, some participants in our cb001 clinical trial have experienced serious adverse events, two of which have been determined to be possibly related to cb001. a serious adverse event is an event that results in significant medical consequences, such as hospitalization, disability or death and must be reported to the fda. while we believe that the serious adverse event profiles we have observed are consistent with those of the disease conditions of patients in the trial and with those associated with stem cell and bone marrow transplants generally, we cannot assure you that safety concerns regarding cb001 will not develop. we have only recently initiated our first clinical trial for cb001, and thus have no clinical trial history for this product candidate. indeed, the fda has relatively little experience with therapeutics based on cellular medicine generally. as a result, the pathway to regulatory approval for cb001 may be more complex and lengthy than for approval of a new conventional drug. similarly, to obtain approval to market our stem cell products outside of the united states, we will need to submit clinical data concerning our products and receive regulatory approval from governmental agencies, which in certain countries includes approval of the price we intend to charge for our product. we may encounter delays or rejections if changes occur in regulatory agency policies during the period in which we develop a product candidate or during the period required for review of any application for regulatory agency approval. if we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use of cb001 or other products under development, we will not be able to commercialize such products, and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.our cell preservation activities are subject to regulations that may impose significant costs and restrictions on us. cord blood preservation. our viacord cord blood preservation product is currently subject to fda regulations requiring infectious disease testing. we have registered with the fda as a cord blood preservation service, listed our products with the fda, and we are subject to fda inspection. in addition, the fda has recently adopted new good tissue practice (gtp)regulations that establish a comprehensive regulatory program for human cellular and tissue-based products and finalized rules for donor eligibility and that will become effective in may of 2005. we believe that we comply with existing regulatory requirements and will be in compliance with the new gtp regulations as recently adopted. however, we may not be able to maintain this compliance or comply with future regulatory requirements that may be imposed on us, including product standards that may be developed. moreover, the cost of compliance with government regulations may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. regulation of our cord blood preservation services in foreign jurisdictions is still evolving. consistent with industry practice, the viacord cord blood collection kits have not been cleared as a medical device. the fda could at any time require us to obtain medical device premarket application (pma)approval or 510(k)clearance for the collection kits, or new drug application supplement (snda) approval for a drug component of the kits. securing any necessary medical device 510(k)clearance or pmaapproval for the cord blood collection kits, or snda approval for a drug component of the kits, may involve the submission of a substantial volume of data and may require a lengthy substantive review. the fda also could require that we cease distributing the collection kits and require us to obtain medical device 510(k)clearance or pmaapproval for the kits or sndaapproval of a drug component of the kits prior to further distribution of the kits. of the states in which we provide cord blood banking services, only new jersey, newyork, maryland, kentucky, illinois and pennsylvania currently require that cord blood banks be licensed or registered. we are currently licensed or registered to operate in new jersey, newyork, kentucky and illinois and we believe that we will be able to comply with the license and registration requirements inmaryland and pennsylvania which we recently identified. if other states adopt requirements for the licensing or registration of cord blood preservation services, we would have to obtain licenses or register to continue providing services in those states. oocyte cryopreservation. there are no established precedents for us and international regulation of oocyte cryopreservation. we anticipate that in the unites states cryopreservation of oocytes will be regulated similarly to viacords family umbilical cord blood cryopreservation product. we also anticipate that some of the components used in this product will be regulated as medical devices under a 510(k)clearance mechanism. for instance, prior to marketing this product, our media supplier will be required to obtain 510(k)clearance for the technology we have licensed for use in the cryopreservation of oocytes. the 510(k)clearance process typically takes three to twelve months from the time of submission to being able to market a product, but can take significantly longer. in november of 2004, our media supplier submitted a 510(k) to the fda for clearance of the oocyte cryopreservation media. in january of 2005, our media supplier informed us that they had received a letter from the fda that included the following information: a statement that our media supplier will need to conduct a clinical study that produces pregnancy and birth rates data to support the application;and a request that various additional information be submitted, including stability, toxicity testing, biocompatibility and labeling information. clinical data were not included in the original 510(k) application. our media supplier intends to address the fda letter and submit existing, published third party clinical data and to submit additional information to the pending 510(k) application. we believe that the existing, published clinical data may be sufficient to support 510(k) clearance of the media; however, it is likely that a new clinical trial will be required which could substantially delay 510(k) clearance and our launch of viacyte. in addition, although the letter from the fda did not suggest that any other approval process would be required other than the 510(k) process, the fda could at any time determine, for instance, that: cryopreservation of oocytes requires biologic marketing approval, entailing an investigational new drug (ind)application to conduct clinical trials and extensive clinical and nonclinical data and a biologics license application (bla)for market approval; and/or components used to cryopreserve the oocytes require pmas. either scenario would substantially lengthen our planned developmental timeline for and substantially increase the costs of commercializing this service. we have not investigated the regulations for the cryopreservation of oocytes in foreign jurisdictions.we depend on patents and other proprietary rights that may fail to protect our business. our success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, technologies and trade secrets. we own or have exclusive licenses to five us patents and two international patents. we also own or have exclusive licenses to 13pending applications in the united states and 52pending applications in foreign countries. our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. the patent position of biotechnology companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has recently been the subject of much litigation. neither the uspatent and trademark office nor the courts have a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many biotechnology patents. the claims of our existing uspatents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may not offer significant protection of our selective amplification and other technologies. our patents on selective amplification, in particular, are quite broad in that they cover selection and amplification of any targeted cell population. while selective amplification is covered by issued patents and we are not aware of any challenges, patents with broad claims tend to be more vulnerable to challenge by other parties than patents with more narrowly written claims. our patent applications covering unrestricted somatic stem cells (usscs) claim these cells as well as their use in the treatment of many diseases. it is possible that these cells could be covered by other patents or patentapplications which identify, isolate or use the same cells by other markers, although we are not aware of any. third parties may challenge, narrow, invalidate or circumvent any patents we obtain based on these applications. furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent. for instance, our patents on selective amplification issued in 1997 and will expire in 2014. to the extent our product candidates based on that technology are not commercialized significantly ahead of this date, or to the extent we have no other patent protection on such products, those products would not be protected by patents beyond 2014. without patent protection, those products might have to compete with identical products by competitors. in an effort to protect our unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how as trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements. these agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. in addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.cb001 and our other cellular product candidates represent new forms of therapy or products that the marketplace may not accept. even if we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for cb001 or other stem cell therapy products, the market may not accept them. other than hematopoietic stem cell transplants, stem cell therapy is not currently a commonly used procedure. similarly, our oocyte cryopreservation product candidate, if developed and cleared for commercial use, may not be accepted by the market. market demand for our products will depend primarily on acceptance by patients, physicians, medical centers and third party payers. commercial acceptance will be dependent upon several factors, including: the number and relative efficacy of products that compete with our product; our ability to supply a sufficient amount of our product to meet demand; our ability to build and maintain, or access through third parties, a capable sales force; our ability to successfully fund launch costs;and our ability to obtain insurance coverage and reimbursement for our cellular therapy products.our success will depend in part on establishing and maintaining effective strategic partnerships and collaborations. a key aspect of our business strategy is to establish strategic relationships in order to gain access to technology and critical raw materials, to expand or complement our research, development or commercialization capabilities, or to reduce the cost of developing or commercializing products on our own. we currently have strategic relationships with amgen, genzyme and massachusetts general hospital. while we are currently in discussions with a number of companies, universities, research institutions, public cord blood banks and others to establish additional relationships and collaborations, we may not reach definitive agreements with any of them. even if we enter into these arrangements, we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms. furthermore, these arrangements may require us to grant certain rights to third parties, including exclusive marketing rights to one or more products, or may have other terms that are burdensome to us, and may involve the acquisition of our securities. our partners may decide to develop alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others. if any of our partners terminate their relationship with us orfail to perform their obligations in a timely manner, the development or commercialization of our technology and potential products may be substantially delayed.third parties may own or control patents or patent applications that are infringed by our technologies or product candidates. ou</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS An investment in the shares of Common Stock offered hereby is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information in this Prospectus, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in the shares of Common Stock offered hereby. Development Stage Company; History of Operating Losses; and Negative Cash Flow. Sylvan and MCI organized Caliber in November 1996. To date, Caliber has been engaged principally in development activities. The Company generated minimal revenues during 1997 and, therefore, has incurred operating losses and negative cash flow since inception. As of December 31, 1997, Caliber had accumulated losses of approximately $15.2 million, and the Company expects to continue to incur significant losses for at least the next two years. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability or generate positive cash flow. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."Significant Cash Requirements. The Company's continued development, construction, expansion and operation of its learning network will require substantial capital. The Company's ability to fund its planned expenditures and operations depends upon its ability to obtain sufficient equity and debt financing. The Company's initial capitalization consisted of $13.0 million in equity from Sylvan, MCI and the other initial stockholders. MCI agreed to provide $20.0 million, as needed, in lease financing or lease guarantees for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and Sylvan agreed to guarantee up to $3.0 million of the Company's debt or to provide up to a $3.0 million line of credit, at an interest rate of 1% above the NationsBank prime rate. As of December 31, 1997, $4.0 million of MCI's Lease and Guarantee Commitment had been used and all of the Sylvan Loan had been drawn. During 1997, the Company received $2.6 million in partial payment of the Sylvan Subscription. The Company expects to receive approximately $57.9 million in net proceeds from this offering and approximately $5.4 million from Sylvan's payment of the balance due on the Sylvan Subscription. Of these amounts, $3.3 million will be used to repay the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the Sylvan Loan, $2.9 million to repay deferred management fees to Sylvan and $1.2 million to pay accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. This will leave Caliber with approximately $55.9 million of net proceeds from this offering and payment of the balance of the Sylvan Subscription, $16.0 million of unused lease commitments from MCI, $3.0 million of available borrowings under the Sylvan Loan and $3.9 million of existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 1997. There can be no assurance that these cash resources following this offering will be sufficient to fund the Company's expected negative cash flow and its capital expenditures. The Company, therefore, may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financing necessary to satisfy its cash requirements or to implement its growth strategy successfully, in which event the Company will be forced to curtail its planned business expansion and may be unable to fund its ongoing operations. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."Technology and Technology Implementation Risks. The successful operation of the Caliber network requires the development of sophisticated software and the integration of a number of diverse communications technologies. To date, Caliber has only tested the software and the network under simulated operating conditions and operated the network under actual operating conditions on a limited basis. The ability of the network to function as intended at multiple sites simultaneously cannot be confirmed until a significant volume of actual programs are regularly delivered over the Caliber network. Technical difficulties may prevent or delay the Company's offering of educational programs, which is likely to have a material adverse effect on market acceptance of the network for distance learning. See "Business--Caliber Technology."Risk of Non-Acceptance of Caliber Learning Concept. Use of the Caliber Campuses will require a significant change in the way universities, corporations and working adults experience graduate level learning and professional training. Prominent universities may be unwilling to accept the Caliber network as an appropriate way to provide quality education, and faculty members may be unwilling to use the Caliber network 7 to teach. Corporations and students may not accept the Caliber network as an alternative to traditional classroom instruction. If the Caliber network fails to gain this acceptance, it is unlikely that Caliber will ever become a viable business. See "Business--The Caliber Network."Rapid Expansion of Operations. The Company plans to expand its business rapidly. The Company currently has 34 Caliber Campuses open and expects to have 41 Caliber Campuses open in 40 markets by September 1998. There can be no assurance that all 41 Caliber Campuses will be opened on schedule. The Company's ability to manage its rapid expansion effectively will require it to develop effective operating, financial and accounting systems and to add and retain qualified personnel at each Caliber Campus and at the corporate level. Failure to develop financial controls and accounting and reporting systems or add and retain personnel that adequately support the Company's growth will materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business--Employees" and "Management."Reliance on Sylvan Management and Systems. Currently, the Company relies extensively on Sylvan's resources, systems and personnel for management, administrative, legal, accounting and financial functions. The Company also uses office space leased by Sylvan. Sylvan has agreed to provide payroll, legal, accounting and other services and lease space only through 1999 for a fee of $2.0 million in each of 1998 and 1999 and is not obligated to continue to do so thereafter. During the next two years, the Company will be required to develop its own systems to replace those currently provided by Sylvan and to add and integrate a substantial number of new managerial, finance, accounting and support personnel. Failure to develop these systems or add and retain personnel to manage the Company's business effectively would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and growth. See "Business-- Employees," "Management" and "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions-- Sylvan Management Agreement."Dependence on Skilled Personnel. The ability to provide distance learning services as contemplated by the Company will require the services of skilled technicians and educational facilitators. In addition, the Company will need additional marketing and sales personnel to support planned growth. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in adding or retaining the necessary personnel. Failure to do so is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and growth. See "Business--Marketing and Sales" and--"Employees."Dependence on Strategic Partners. The Company's success will depend upon establishing and maintaining strategic alliances with prominent universities and corporations to provide high quality educational and training programs. However, to date, only Johns Hopkins, Wharton, Compaq, Macmillan and MCI Systemhouse have agreed to provide programs through the Caliber network, with Johns Hopkins and Wharton each agreeing to deliver only a single program. Many of these contracts are terminable if Caliber fails to achieve stated performance objectives contained in these contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining and expanding these existing relationships or that it will be able to establish and maintain new strategic relationships with other prominent universities or corporations. If the initial programs are unsuccessful, if these universities and corporations do not expand their offerings through the Caliber network or if Caliber is unable to enter into other strategic relationships, it is unlikely that Caliber will become a viable business. See "Business--Strategy."Untested Business Plan. The Company made numerous assumptions in developing its business plan, such as the number of students expected to enroll in a given program, the prices the Company will be able to charge for programs, the rate at which additional programs will be added to the Caliber network and the cost of operating Caliber Campuses. The assumptions underlying Caliber's business plan may prove to be too optimistic, and the Company may encounter delays in achieving the objectives in its business plan. This is likely to result in lower than planned revenues, higher than expected expenses and sustained unprofitability. The Company can give no assurance that it will be able to adjust its operations and business plan. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 8Significant Regulation. Many of the states in which Caliber intends to operate Caliber Campuses require that any entity providing educational programs obtain a license to operate. Since Caliber's distance learning concept is novel and state authorities may not have substantial experience with arrangements of this type, the Company cannot predict with certainty whether states will grant the licenses necessary to offer educational programs at all Caliber Campuses. Certain states accept accreditation as evidence of meeting minimum state standards for a license, and other states apply separate standards. Accreditation organizations may require prior approval and periodic monitoring of distance learning programs. Caliber expects that each university offering courses through the Caliber network will be required to obtain the necessary license, possibly one for each program offered, in each state where a Caliber Campus is located. If the Company or the universities are unable to obtain the necessary licenses or accreditations or if the licenses or accreditations are delayed or revoked, Caliber's business and growth may be materially adversely affected.Congress is expected to consider reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended ("HEA"), in 1998. Treatment of distance learning is expected to be a major topic in the reauthorization process. There can be no assurance that the HEA will not be amended to impose stricter or additional requirements which would affect the Company. In addition, state and federal regulation of distance learning programs, as well as private accreditation of such programs, are undergoing significant review by the U.S. Department of Education, state regulators and accreditation organizations. Caliber cannot predict the scope or the outcome of this review, but additional regulation of distance learning may result from this review. This additional regulation may adversely affect the way Caliber intends to deliver educational content over its network. See "Business--Government Regulation."Rapid Technological Change. The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and the Company's future success will depend on its ability to implement technological advances. Caliber anticipates that if interactive distance learning becomes accepted as an effective means of providing educational and training programs, the industry will evolve rapidly. To remain competitive, Caliber must be able to respond quickly to evolving industry trends, technological advances and changes in client needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in adapting to these trends, advances or changes. In addition, technologies developed by competitors may significantly reduce demand for the Company's services or render the Company's services obsolete. See "Business--Caliber Technology."Competition. Competition among providers of lifelong learning and professional training is intense. Management believes that its principal potential competitors will be prominent universities located in the markets served by Caliber Campuses. In each of Caliber's markets, there are also other two-year and four-year colleges which have their own continuing education and graduate level programs. Each of these competitors offers live classroom instruction and has an established reputation in the educational field and, therefore, may enjoy a competitive advantage. In addition, two-year and four- year higher education institutions, particularly public institutions, are offering distance education courses, and several distance education initiatives are currently underway among public higher education institutions. Other competitors include for-profit educational organizations, such as the Apollo Group's University of Phoenix, Strayer University and DeVry's Keller School of Management, that provide lifelong learning programs targeted to working adults and feature live classroom instruction. Caliber may also compete with distance learning companies that offer self-paced correspondence courses, videos, audiocassettes and other distance learning products. More recent distance learning products include CD-rom and Internet-based instruction. If the Caliber distance learning concept proves successful, Caliber expects competitors to enter the market. For example, businesses that have facilities in multiple markets that could be linked by satellite, such as major hotel and movie theater chains, could decide to establish networks of distance learning facilities to compete with Caliber. Westcott Communications, Inc., which has established a one-way satellite-based network currently used by a number of larger corporations to distribute their training programs, could decide to make its network interactive. The Company also competes against a significant number of third party training companies that provide various training programs to corporations. In addition, corporations may continue to use internal resources to satisfy their training needs. See "Business--Competition." 9Limited Protection of Proprietary Expertise and Methodologies. The Company's success will be highly dependent upon its specialized and proprietary expertise, methodologies and software. The Company must rely on a combination of trade secret laws, employee nondisclosure policies and third-party confidentiality agreements. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such rights or that third parties will not independently develop functionally equivalent or superior methodologies or software. There also can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company relative to the Company's methodologies, which could result in costly litigation or the need to establish license arrangements. The Company intends to seek a patent on certain design features of its network. However, there can be no assurance this patent will be granted or, if granted, that it will cover all the proprietary features of the network. See "Business--Proprietary Rights."Dependence on Management. The Company is highly dependent on the members of its senior management, particularly Messrs. Nguyen, Frier, Dobkin, Polivka, Locher and Peterson, the loss of any of whose services may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of critical development, marketing and other business objectives. If the Company's business expands, attracting and retaining additional qualified management personnel will be critical to the Company's success. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to expand its business. The Company does not have employment contracts with senior management. The Company is in the process of obtaining a $3 million "key man" insurance policy on Mr. Nguyen's life. See "Management."Control by Existing Stockholders. Upon completion of this offering, MCI, Sylvan, Mr. Hoehn-Saric and Mr. Becker will beneficially own 1,242,513, 1,227,393, 1,718,351 and 1,718,351 shares of Common Stock, respectively, and Sylvan will own 5,167,328 shares of 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, which is convertible at any time after the second anniversary of this offering into an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, MCI, Sylvan and Messrs. Hoehn-Saric and Becker together will control approximately 49.1% of the Common Stock (or 66.7% if Sylvan were to convert all of its shares of 6% Non-Voting Preferred Stock to Common Stock and MCI were to exercise the MCI warrant). This is likely to be sufficient to enable them to effectively control the outcome of any matter submitted to the stockholders, assuming they choose to vote their shares together. See "Principal and Selling Stockholders" and "Description of Capital Stock."Substantial Proceeds of Offering Payable to Sylvan and MCI. Of the net proceeds of this offering, the Company will use $3.3 million to pay accrued interest and principal on the Sylvan Loan, $1.2 million to pay MCI accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and $2.9 million to pay accrued management fees due to Sylvan. As a result, a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering will not be available to the Company to fund its operations and planned growth. See "Use of Proceeds."Potential Conflicts of Interest. Conflicts of interest may arise between the Company, Sylvan and MCI in a number of areas relating to their ongoing or future relationships. There are no non-competition agreements between Caliber and either Sylvan or MCI. Sylvan currently provides substantial management and administrative services to Caliber but is not obligated to continue to do so after 1999. MCI has agreed to provide $20.0 million of lease financing to Caliber, as needed, and provides various ongoing telecommunications services to Caliber. Caliber may enter into additional material transactions and agreements with Sylvan and MCI in the future. MCI, Sylvan and Sterling Caliber have the right to require that their shares of Caliber Common Stock be registered for sale under the Securities Act at various times over the next four years and may decide to sell their shares in the public market at any time. Directors of the Company who are also directors or employees of Sylvan or MCI may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting the Company, such as financing, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities. There can be no assurance that these or any other conflicts of interest will be resolved in favor of the Company. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."Shares Eligible for Future Sale. Upon completion of this offering, the Company will have outstanding 12,018,642 shares of Common Stock, plus 1,162,895 shares issuable upon exercise of currently outstanding options, 1,193,573 shares issuable upon exercise of the MCI Warrant and 5,167,328 shares issuable upon 10 conversion by Sylvan of the 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock. The 5,700,000 shares offered hereby will be freely transferable unless acquired by affiliates of the Company. All of the remaining outstanding shares, upon expiration of the Underwriters' lock-up described below, will be saleable under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, unless then held by affiliates of the Company. The 1,162,895 shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options and the 985,133 shares reserved for future grants under the Company's 1998 Plan will be registered under the Securities Act upon completion of this offering. Those shares will be freely transferable upon issuance unless held by affiliates of the Company. The Company has granted MCI, Sylvan and Sterling Caliber, who hold an aggregate of 7,100,181 shares of Common Stock (assuming exercise of the MCI Warrant) shares of Common Stock and 5,167,328 shares of 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, the right to have their shares of Common Stock registered under the Securities Act on one or more occasions over the next four years. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale."Sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock following this offering, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the Common Stock and could impair the Company's ability to raise capital through an offering of its equity securities. All of the Company's officers and employees who own Common Stock, or hold options to purchase 7,500 shares or more, have agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any of their shares for a period of two years after the date of this Prospectus without the prior written consent of both BT Alex. Brown Incorporated and the Company. Sylvan, MCI and Sterling Caliber, who will hold in the aggregate 7,100,181 shares of Common Stock and 5,167,328 shares of 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock upon completion of this offering, have agreed not to sell or dispose of any of their shares for a period of one year after the date of this Prospectus without the prior written consent of BT Alex. Brown Incorporated. See "Underwriting."No Prior Market for Common Stock; Possible Volatility of Stock Price. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock, and there can be no assurance that an active public market for the Common Stock will develop or be sustained after the offering. The initial public offering price was determined by negotiations among the Company and the Representatives of the Underwriters and may not be indicative of market prices of the Common Stock after this offering. See "Underwriting." The market price of the Common Stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in Caliber's quarterly operating results and other events or factors, such as Caliber's announcement of new strategic alliances with prominent universities or corporations, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and announcements by other companies in the lifelong learning industry. Moreover, the stock market and the market prices of the shares of many emerging growth companies in recent years have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific company. Broad stock market fluctuations, as well as economic conditions generally, may adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. There can be no assurance that the market price of the Common Stock will not decline below the initial public offering price.Certain Anti-takeover Provisions. Certain provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Charter") and Maryland law may have the effect of discouraging a change of control of the Company or deterring tender offers for the Common Stock. The Charter grants to the Board of Directors authority to issue shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which the holders of some of the shares of Common Stock might receive a premium over the then-prevailing market price of the Common Stock. The Charter also divides the Board of Directors into three classes of Directors who will serve for staggered terms, which may have the effect of inhibiting or delaying a change of control of the Company. A Director may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. See "Description of Capital Stock--Anti- takeover Provisions of Charter and By-Laws."The Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL") prohibits certain business combinations between a Maryland corporation and any person who owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's capital stock (an "Interested Stockholder") or an affiliate thereof for a period of five years after the most recent date on which the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder and imposes additional requirements on the approval and terms of the transaction. The MGCL also provides that shares acquired by a stockholder which 11</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this prospectus before you decide to buy our common stock. an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer if any of the following risks is realized. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. if any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline.risks related to our business our revenues are highly dependent on a small number of clients, including a single client from whom we receive more than 50% of our revenues and which is also our largest stockholder, and the loss of any one of our major clients could significantly impact our business. we have historically earned, and believe that in the future we will continue to earn, a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients. household international, which is our largest client, will own approximately 17.5% of our common stock after the completion of this offering and continue to be our largest stockholder, accounted for 45.0%, 47.4% and 53.2% of our total revenues in the years ended december31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, which, in 2003, included revenues from its affiliates within the hsbcgroup. morgan stanley, which is our second largest client and will own approximately 4.8% of our common stock after the completion of this offering, accounted for 9.6%, 13.5% and 13.0% of our total revenues in the years ended december31, 2001, 2002 and 2003. our five largest clients together accounted for 70.7%, 74.7% and 80.7% of our total revenues in the years ended december31, 2001, 2002 and 2003. if we were to lose household international, morgan stanley or one of our other major clients or have a major client cancel substantial projects or otherwise significantly reduce its volume of business with us, our revenues and profitability would be materially reduced.a significant or prolonged economic downturn in, increased regulation of and restrictions imposed on the financial services industry may result in our clients reducing or postponing spending on the services we offer. a significant portion of our revenues is derived from u.s. clients in the financial services industry, which is cyclical and recently experienced a significant downturn. in the years ended december31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, approximately 71.3%, 79.1% and 82.4% of our revenues were derived from the united states. if economic conditions weaken, particularly in the u.s. financial services industry, our clients may reduce or postpone their it spending significantly, which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability. in addition to this economic downturn, there has been recent increased regulation of, and restrictions imposed on, financial services companies, which may negatively affect our clients and cause them to reduce their spending on the it services we offer.our failure to anticipate rapid changes in technology may negatively impact demand for our services in the marketplace. our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and implement business and technology solutions that anticipate rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards and client preferences. we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis, which may negatively impact demand for our solutions in the marketplace. also, products and technologies developed by our competitors may make our solutions noncompetitive or obsolete. anyone or a combination of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and successfully complete client engagements. the it services market is highly competitive, and our competitors have advantages that may allow them to better use economic incentives to secure contracts with our existing and prospective clients and attract skilled it professionals. the it services market in which we operate includes a large number of participants and is highly competitive. our primary competitors include: >large consulting and other professional service firms, including accenture, bearingpoint, cap gemini and deloitte& touche; >offshore it service providers, including cognizant technology solutions, infosys technologies and wipro; and >in-house it departments. the market in which we compete is experiencing rapid changes in its competitive landscape. some of our competitors are large consulting firms or offshore it service providers which have significant resources and financial capabilities combined with much larger numbers of it professionals. some of these competitors have gained access to public and private capital or have merged or consolidated with better capitalized partners, which has created and may in the future create larger and better capitalized competitors with superior abilities to compete for market share generally and for our existing and prospective clients. our competitors may be better positioned to use significant economic incentives to secure contracts with our existing and prospective clients. these competitors may also be better able to compete for skilled professionals by offering them more attractive compensation or other incentives. in addition, one or more of our competitors may develop and implement methodologies that yield price reductions, superior productivity or enhanced quality that we are not able to match. any of these circumstances would have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin. we also expect additional competition from offshore it service providers with current operations in other countries, such as china and the philippines, where we do not have operations other than our regional service center in hong kong. these competitors may be able to offer services using business models that are more effective than ours.our existing stockholders, including household international, which will continue to own a large percentage of our common stock after the completion of this offering, have voting control over kanbay and their interests may differ from other stockholders. upon completion of this offering, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates will beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 31.4% of our outstanding common stock, and our existing stockholders will beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 77.9% of our outstanding common stock. in particular, household international will beneficially own approximately 17.5% of our common stock after the completion of this offering. as a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. these stockholders may exercise this control even if they are opposed by our other stockholders. without the consent of these stockholders, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions (including the acquisition of our company by third parties) that may be viewed as beneficial to us or our other stockholders. in addition, this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock if investors perceive disadvantages in owning stock in a company with controlling stockholders. negative public perception in the united states regarding offshore it service providers and recently proposed federal legislation may adversely affect demand for our services. recently, many organizations and public figures have publicly expressed concerns about a perceived association between offshore it service providers and the loss of jobs in the united states. our clients may stop using our services to avoid any negative perception that may be associated with utilizing an offshore it service provider. in addition, federal legislation has been proposed that, if enacted, may restrict u.s. companies from outsourcing their it work to companies outside the united states. certain u.s. states have enacted legislation that restricts governmental agencies from outsourcing their it work to companies outside the united states. although we currently do not have significant contracts with governmental entities in the united states, it is possible that u.s. private sector companies may in the future be restricted from outsourcing their it work related to government contracts to offshore service providers. any expansion of existing laws or the enactment of new legislation restricting offshore it outsourcing may adversely impact our ability to do business in the united states, particularly if these changes are widespread.if we do not effectively manage our anticipated rapid growth, we may not be able to develop or implement new systems, procedures and controls that are required to support our operations, market our services and manage our relationships with our clients. between january1, 2001 and march31, 2004, the number of our employees has grown from 912 to 2,882. we expect that we will continue to grow and our anticipated growth could place a significant strain on our ability to: >recruit, train, motivate and retain highly skilled it, marketing and management personnel; >adhere to our high quality process execution standards; >preserve our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment; >develop and improve our internal administrative infrastructure and our financial, operational, communications and other internal systems; and >maintain high levels of client satisfaction. to manage this anticipated growth, we must implement and maintain proper operational and financial controls and systems in order to expand our services and employee base. further, we will need to manage our relationships with various clients, vendors and other third parties. we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to develop and implement, on a timely basis, the systems, procedures and controls required to support our operations. our future operating results will also depend on our ability to develop and maintain a successful marketing and sales organization despite our rapid growth. if we are unable to manage our growth, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.our services may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which may subject us to legal liability, harm our reputation, prevent us from offering some services to our clients or distract management. we cannot be sure that our services or the products of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients. these claims may harm our reputation, distract management, cost us money and/or prevent us from offering some services to our clients. historically, we have generally agreed to indemnify our clients for all expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties based on the services that we have performed. in some9 instances, the amount of these indemnities may be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. in addition, as a result of intellectual property litigation, we may be required to stop selling, incorporating or using products that use the infringed intellectual property. we may be required to obtain a license or pay a royalty to make, sell or use the relevant technology from the owner of the infringed intellectual property, such licenses or royalties may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. we may also be required to redesign our products or change our methodologies so as not to use the infringed intellectual property, which may not be technically or commercially feasible and may cause us to expend significant resources. any claims or litigation in this area, whether we ultimately win or lose, could be time-consuming and costly and/or injure our reputation. as the number of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases, we believe that companies in our industry will face more frequent infringement claims. defending against these claims, even if the claims have no merit, could be expensive and divert management's attention and resources from operating our company.we have a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and unauthorized use of our intellectual property could result in the loss of clients. our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. we rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. however, existing laws of some countries in which we provide services, such as india, provide protection of intellectual property rights which may be more limited than those provided in the united states. the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. our competitors may be able to imitate or duplicate our services or methodologies. the unauthorized use or duplication of our intellectual property could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. we may need to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. any such litigation could be time-consuming and costly.our engagements with clients may not be profitable. unexpected costs or delays could make our contracts unprofitable.when making proposals for engagements, we estimate the costs and timing for completing the projects. these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding the efficiencies of our methodologies and costs. the profitability of our engagements, and in particular our fixed-price contracts, is affected by increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, which could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable. the occurrence of any of these costs or delays could result in an unprofitable engagement or litigation. our clients may terminate our contracts on short notice.our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive, engagement-by-engagement basis, rather than under exclusive long-term contracts. many of our consulting engagements are less than 12months in duration, and our clients may terminate most of our engagements on short notice. large client projects typically involve multiple engagements or stages, and there is always a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements. when contracts are terminated, we lose the associated revenues, and we may not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner or transition employees to new engagements in an efficient manner. our profitability is dependent on our billing and utilization rates, and our ability to control these factors is only partially within our control. our profit margin is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the utilization rate, or chargeability, of our professionals. accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals, we will not be able to sustain our profit margin, and our profitability will suffer. the rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including: >our clients' perception of our ability to add value through our services; >our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency; >introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors; >pricing policies of our competitors; and >general economic conditions. our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors, including: >seasonal trends, primarily our hiring cycle and holiday and summer vacations; >our ability to transition employees from completed and/or terminated projects to new engagements; >the amount of time spent by our employees on non-billable training activities; >our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount; and >our ability to manage employee attrition.if we are unsuccessful in developing our new outsourcing business, we may not recoup our start-up costs and other expenses incurred in connection with this business. we recently formed kanbay managed solutions,inc. to pursue application management outsourcing opportunities. we must fund certain start-up costs and other expenses in connection with this business. we anticipate that outsourcing engagements may have a different engagement length and may require different skills than the services we have traditionally offered. the success of these service offerings is dependent, in part, upon continued demand for these services by our existing and new clients and our ability to meet this demand in a cost-competitive and timely manner. in addition, our ability to effectively offer a wide breadth of outsourcing services depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings. to obtain engagements to provide outsourcing services, we are also more likely to compete with large, well established firms, resulting in increased competition and marketing costs. accordingly, we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings.it would be difficult to replace our chairman and chief executive officer. we are highly dependent upon our chairman and chief executive officer, raymondj. spencer, who is one of our founders and our first employee. mr.spencer's efforts, talent and leadership have been, and will continue to be, criticial to our success. the diminution or loss of the services of mr.spencer could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.our management has limited experience managing a public company and regulatory compliance may divert its attention from the day-to-day management of our business. our management team has historically operated our business as a private company. the individuals who now constitute our management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company and limited experience complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public11 companies. our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition into a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws. in particular, these new obligations will require substantial attention from our senior management and divert its attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could materially and adversely impact our business operations.we will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company. we will face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that we do not incur as a private company. the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission, the public company accounting oversight board and the nasdaq national market, require changes in the corporate governance practices of public companies. we expect that the additional obligations imposed on us by these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of our related legal, accounting and administrative activities by approximately $2million per year. these increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives. we also expect to incur substantially higher costs to obtain directors and officers insurance.we are investing substantial cash assets in new facilities, and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately. we currently plan to spend approximately $45million for the construction of a new delivery center in hyderabad, india and the expansion of our delivery center in pune, india. we may face cost overruns or project delays in connection with these facilities or other facilities we may construct in the future. such expansion may significantly increase our fixed costs. if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately, our profitability will be reduced.our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing. we expect that our cash flow from operations, together with our net proceeds of this offering and the amounts we are able to borrow under our credit facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated needs for at least the next two years. however, we may in the future be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business. additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our profitability. moreover, strategic relationships, if necessary to raise additional funds, may require us to relinquish some important rights or modify our allocation of resources.we do not control the business, operations or dividend policy of sss, which contributes a significant portion of our net income. we own a 49.0% interest in sss holdings corporation limited (sss), which is a liverpool, england based it services firm that focuses primarily on the securities industry with revenues earned predominantly in the united kingdom. we do not have control of the board of directors of sss or voting control of sss. consequently, we do not control the business, operations or dividend policy of sss. for the years ended december31, 2002 and 2003, our share of the earnings of sss provided us with $2.2million and $2.0million of equity in earnings of affiliate. risks related to our indian and international operations wage pressures in india may reduce our profit margins. wage costs in india have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the united states and europe for comparably skilled professionals. however, wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states, which will result in increased costs for it professionals, particularly project managers and other mid-level professionals. we may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive. compensation increases may reduce our profit margins and otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition.changes in the policies of the government of india or political instability could delay the further liberalization of the indian economy and adversely affect economic conditions in india, which could adversely impact our business. the role of the indian central and state governments in the indian economy is significant. although the current government of india supported the economic liberalization of the indian economy, this economic liberalization may not continue in the future and specific laws and policies affecting technology companies, foreign investment, currency exchange and other matters affecting our business could change as well. changes in the policies of the government of india or political instability could delay the further liberalization of the indian economy and could adversely affect business and economic conditions in india in general and our business in particular.terrorist attacks or a war or regional conflicts could adversely affect the indian economy, disrupt our operations and cause our business to suffer. terrorist attacks, such as the attacks of september11, 2001 in the united states, and other acts of violence or war, such as a conflict between india and pakistan, have the potential to directly impact our clients and the indian economy by making travel more difficult, interrupting lines of communication and effectively curtailing our ability to deliver our services to our clients. these obstacles may increase our expenses and negatively affect our operating results. in addition, military activity, terrorist attacks and political tensions between india and pakistan could create a greater perception that the acquisition of services from companies with significant indian operations involves a higher degree of risk, which could adversely affect our business.disruptions in telecommunications could harm our global delivery model, which could result in client dissatisfaction and a reduction of our revenues. a significant element of our business strategy is to continue to leverage and expand our delivery centers in hyderabad and pune, india. in particular, our delivery center in pune, india accounted for approximately 49.2% of our revenues for the year ended december31, 2003. we depend upon third party service providers and various satellite and optical links to link our global delivery centers to our clients. we may not be able to maintain active voice and data communications between our global delivery centers and our clients' sites at all times. any significant loss in our ability to communicate could result in a disruption in business, which could hinder our performance or our ability to complete client projects on time. this, in turn, could lead to client dissatisfaction and a material adverse effect on our business, our operating results and financial condition.our net income would decrease if the government of india reduces or withdraws tax benefits and other incentives it provides to us or adjusts the amount of our income taxable in india or if we repatriate our earnings from india. currently, we benefit from the tax holidays the government of india gives to the export of it services from specially designated software technology parks in india. when our tax holidays and taxable income deduction expire or terminate beginning in 2005, our tax expense will materially increase, reducing our profitability. recently, the government of india has disallowed these tax exemptions for13 certain software companies and required the companies to pay additional taxes. as a result, we cannot be certain that the government of india will not attempt to disallow our tax holidays or taxable income deduction or require us to pay additional taxes. if we were required to pay additional taxes, our net income and profitability would decrease. for more information regarding our indian tax exemptions, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies, estimates and risksincome taxes." the government of india recently enacted new transfer pricing rules and began audits of companies, including us, that may be subject to these new rules. we believe that our transfer pricing policies reflect best practices in our industry, but we cannot be certain that the audits will not result in adjustments to our indian taxable income given the lack of precedent in applying the new requirements. to the extent our income is taxable in india, any such adjustments would be expected to increase our indian tax liability and to thereby decrease our net income. although we intend to use substantially all of our indian earnings to expand our international operations instead of repatriating these funds to the united states, under indian law if we repatriated our indian earnings in the future or such earnings were no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we would accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings. we cannot currently determine the applicable amount of taxes, however, such amount could be material.restrictions on immigration may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states, which could adversely affect our ability to meet growth and revenue projections. the majority of our it professionals are indian nationals. the ability of our it professionals to work in the united states, europe and in other countries depends on our ability to obtain the necessary work visas and work permits. existing and proposed limitations on and eligibility restrictions for these visas could have a significant impact on our ability to transfer it professionals to the united states, europe and other countries. further, in response to recent global political events, the level of scrutiny in granting visas has increased. new security procedures may delay the issuance of visas and affect our ability to staff projects in a timely way. our reliance on work visas for a significant number of our it professionals makes us particularly vulnerable to legislative changes and strict enforcement of new security procedures, as it affects our ability to staff projects with it professionals who are not citizens of the country where the on-site work is to be performed. if we are not able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our it professionals or encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas, our ability to meet our growth and revenue projections could be adversely affected.currency exchange rate fluctuations will affect our operating results. as indicated in the translation table below, the exchange rate between the indian rupee and the u.s.dollar has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. we expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be generated in u.s. dollars for the foreseeable future and that a significant portion of our expenses, including personnel costs, as well as capital and operating expenditures, will continue to be denominated in indian rupees. accordingly, an appreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar may have a material adverse effect on our cost of revenues, gross profit margin and net income, which may in turn have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. specifically, based on our current cost structure, a 1% appreciation of the indian rupee against the u.s. dollar would cause our gross profit margin to decrease by 12basis points and our operating profit margin to decline by 18basis points. we expect to adopt by july31, 2004 a foreign currency exchange management policy to hedge our exposure tothe indian rupee; however, we do not currently hedge our exposure to any foreign currency and cannot assure you that our foreign currency management policy, if adopted, will be effective.</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. if any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. in that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. risks relating to our businesssince we have not commenced revenue-producing operations, it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business.we have not commenced revenue-producing operations. to date, our operations have consisted of technology research and development, testing, and joint development work with leading potential customers and strategic partners. our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our technology or prospective operations. as a development stage company, we are subject to all the risks inherent in the initial organization, financing, expenditures, complications and delays in a new business. investors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.we have a history of significant operating losses and anticipate continued operating losses for at least the near term.for the three months ended march 31, 2016 and the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we have incurred net losses of $2,488,187, $9,512,141 and $3,817,734, respectively, and our operations have used $1,650,576, $4,387,148 and $2,593,360 of cash, respectively. as of march 31, 2016, december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, we had accumulated deficits of $85,874,810, $83,386,623 and $73,874,482, respectively. we expect to continue to experience negative cash flows from operations until such time as we are able to secure one or more idms or fabless semiconductor manufacturers to qualify and license mst and start full-scale industrial production of a device that incorporates our mst technology and otherwise generate revenue, and control expenses, at levels that will allow us to operate on a cash flow positive basis. while management will endeavor to generate positive cash flows from the commercialization of our mst technology, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in generating positive cash flows from operations. if we are unable to generate positive cash flow within a reasonable period of time, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan or continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire investment.we may need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.as of march 31, 2016, we had total assets of $1,799,805 and a working capital deficit of $15,604,022. on april 1, 2016, we received net proceeds of $5,465,970 from our sale of additional convertible notes. we believe that we require a minimum of $15 million of additional capital in order to fund our current business plan over, at least, the 12 months following the date of this prospectus, including the securing of one or more foundries, idms or fabless semiconductor manufacturers to qualify and license our mst and start full-scale industrial production of a device that incorporates our mst technology. we have undertaken this initial public offering of our common shares to acquire the necessary capital and through this offering we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $21.3 million in addition to the conversion of approximately $22.74 million of debt to equity. however, we may require additional capital, the receipt of which there can be no assurance. in the event we require additional capital, we will endeavor to seek additional funds through various financing sources, including the private sale of our equity and debt securities, licensing fees for our technology and joint ventures with industry partners. in addition, we will consider alternatives to our current business plan that may enable to us to achieve revenue producing operations and meaningful commercial success with a smaller amount of capital. however, there can be no guarantees that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. if such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire investment. the report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended december 31, 2015 states that due to our recurring and expected losses and cash on-hand there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.while the preliminary testing of our mst technology has been successful to-date, there can be no assurance that we will be able to replicate the process, along with all of the expected economic advantages, on a large commercial scale.as of the date of this prospectus, we have done technology simulation work on our mst with universities and potential customers at nodes from 180 nanometers (nm) to 7nm. together with leading industry research facilities and in customer manufacturing facilities, we have also built and tested test element group transistors using mst. the test element group transistors using mst consistently demonstrated increased speed, reliability and energy efficiency over test element group transistors without mst. while we believe that our development and testing to date has proven the effectiveness and benefits of our mst technology, a mst-enabled product has not been qualified and manufactured on a commercial scale. our planof operations for the 12 months following this offering will focus on securing one or more foundries, idms or fabless semiconductor manufacturers as a licensee-customer and start full-scale industrial production of a device that incorporates mst technology. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the adoption of our technology by a potential customer or, if we are successful in doing so, that a mst enabled product manufactured on a commercial scale will provide the expected performance enhancements at the projected cost.the long-term success of our business is dependent on a royalty-based business model, which is inherently risky. the long-term success of our business is dependent on future royalties paid to us by licensee-customers. royalty payments under our licenses may be based, among other things, upon the number of silicon substrate, or wafers, onto which our mst is deposited or a percentage of the net sales of a mst- enabled product or a fixed quarterly amount. we will depend upon our ability to structure, negotiate and enforce agreements for the determination and payment of royalties, as well as upon our licensees compliance with their agreements. we face risks inherent in a royalty-based business model, many of which are outside of our control, such as the following: the rate of adoption and incorporation of our technology by semiconductor designers and manufacturers and the manufacturers of semiconductor fabrication equipment; the length of the design cycle and the ability to successfully integrate our mst technology into integrated circuits; the demand for products incorporating semiconductors that use our licensed technology; the cyclicality of supply and demand for products using our licensed technology; the impact of economic downturns; and the timing of receipt of royalty reports may not meet our revenue recognition criteria resulting in fluctuation in our results of operations.our revenues may be concentrated in a few customers and if we lose any of these customers, or these customers do not pay us, our revenues could be materially adversely affected.if we are able to secure the adoption of our mst by one or more foundries, idms or fabless semiconductor manufacturers and commence revenue producing operations, we expect that for at least the first few years we will earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of customers. due to the concentration and ongoing consolidation within the semiconductor industry, we may also find that over the longer term our revenues are dependent on a relatively few customers. if we lose any of these customers, or these customers do not pay us, our revenues could be materially adversely affected.it may be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose revenues.we will endeavor to provide that the terms of our license agreements require our licensees to document their use of our technology and report related data to us on a regular basis. we will endeavor to provide that the terms of our license agreements give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, however audits can be expensive, time consuming, and may not be cost justified based on our understanding of our licensees businesses. we will endeavor to audit certain licensees to review the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that such audits will be effective to that end.we expect that our product qualification and licensing cycle will be lengthy and costly, and our marketing, engineering and sales efforts may be unsuccessful.we expect to incur significant engineering, marketing and sales expenses prior to entering into our license agreements, generating a license fee and establishing a royalty stream from each licensee. the length of time it takes to establish a new licensing relationship, and for our customers to incorporate our technologies in their integrated circuits, can take 18 to 36 months or longer. as such, we will incur significant expenses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins. if our engineering, marketing and sales efforts are unsuccessful, then the expenses incurred could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.our business operations could suffer in the event of information technology systems failures or security breaches.while we believe that we have implemented adequate security measures within our internal information technology and networking systems, our information technology systems may be subject to security breaches, damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, and telecommunication failures. any system failure or security breach could cause interruptions in our operations in addition to the possibility of losing proprietary information and trade secrets. to the extent that any disruption orsecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our confidential information, our competitive position may be adversely effected and we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.if we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and our confidential information, our business will suffer.we rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and patent, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our technology and intellectual property. if we fail to protect our technology and intellectual property, our licensees and others may seek to use our technology and intellectual property without the payment of license fees and royalties, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly litigation. the growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to secure intellectual property rights in a timely manner, our ability to convince third parties of the applicability of our intellectual property rights to their products, and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights. in certain instances, we attempt to obtain patent protection for portions of our technology, and our license agreements typically include both issued patents and pending patent applications. if we fail to obtain patents in a timely manner or if the patents issued to us do not cover all of the inventions disclosed in our patent applications, others could use portions of our technology and intellectual property without the payment of license fees and royalties. we also rely on trade secret laws rather than patent laws to protect other portions of our proprietary technology. however, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. the misappropriation of our trade secrets or other proprietary information could seriously harm our business. we protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, suppliers and customers. we cannot be certain that these contracts have not been and will not be breached, that we will be able to timely detect unauthorized use or transfer of our technology and intellectual property, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. if we fail to use these mechanisms to protect our technology and intellectual property, or if a court fails to enforce our intellectual property rights, our business will suffer. we cannot be certain that these protection mechanisms can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated or challenged. further, the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect our technology and intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws and enforcement regimes of the u.s. in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our technology and intellectual property adequately against unauthorized use, which could adversely affect our business.a court invalidation or limitation of our key patents could significantly harm our business.our patent portfolio contains some patents that are particularly significant to our mst technology and other business prospects. if any of these key patents are invalidated, or if a court limits the scope of the claims in any of these key patents, the likelihood that companies will take new licenses and that any current licensees will continue to agree to pay under their existing licenses could be significantly reduced. the resulting loss in license fees and royalties could significantly harm our business. moreover, our stock price may fluctuate based on developments in the course of ongoing litigation.we expect to continue to be involved in material legal proceedings in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.from time to time, we identify products that we believe infringe our patents. in that event, we initially seek to license the manufacturer of the infringing products, however if the manufacturer is unwilling to enter into a license agreement, we may have to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights against those products. as disclosed in our business litigation, we are currently involved in a civil litigation against a manufacturer of optical communication products we believe to be infringing one of our patents. litigation stemming from that or other disputes could harm our ability to gain new customers, who may postpone licensing decisions pending the outcome of the litigation or who may, as a result of such litigation, choose not to adopt our technologies. such litigation may also harm our relationships with existing licensees, who may, as a result of such litigation, cease making royalty or other payments to us or challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents or the scope of our license agreements. in addition, the costs associated with legal proceedings are typically high, relatively unpredictable and not completely within our control. these costs may be materially higher than expected, which could adversely affect our operating results and lead to volatility in the price of our common stock. whether or not determined in our favor or ultimately settled, litigation diverts our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from our business operations. furthermore, an adverse decision in any of these legal actions could result in a loss of our proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses from others, limit the value of our licensed technology or otherwise negatively impact our stock price or our business and consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. even if we prevail in our legal actions, significant contingencies may exist to their settlement and final resolution, including the scope of the liability of each party, our ability to enforce judgments against the parties, the ability and willingness of theparties to make any payments owed or agreed upon and the dismissal of the legal action by the relevant court, none of which are completely within our control. parties that may be obligated to pay us royalties could be insolvent or decide to alter their business activities or corporate structure, which could affect our ability to collect royalties from such parties.our technologies may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could lead to costly disputes or disruptions.the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent allegations of intellectual property infringement. any allegation of infringement could be time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve, result in substantial diversion of management resources, cause suspension of operations or force us to enter into royalty, license, or other agreements rather than dispute the merits of such allegation. furthermore, third parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could block our ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our technologies, and the ability of our customers to develop or commercialize their products incorporating our technologies, in the u.s. and abroad. if patent holders or other holders of intellectual property initiate legal proceedings, we may be forced into protracted and costly litigation. we may not be successful in defending such litigation and may not be able to procure any required royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms or at all.if we are unable to manage future expansion effectively, our business, operations and financial condition may suffer significantly, resulting in decreased productivity.if our mst proves to be commercially valuable, it is likely that we will experience a rapid growth phase that could place a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, technical, operational and financial resources. our organization, procedures and management may not be adequate to fully support the expansion of our operations or the efficient execution of our business strategy. if we are unable to manage future expansion effectively, our business, operations and financial condition may suffer significantly, resulting in decreased productivity.if integrated circuits incorporating our technologies are used in defective products, we may be subject to product liability or other claims.if our mst technology is used in defective or malfunctioning products, we could be sued for damages, especially if the defect or malfunction causes physical harm to people. while we will endeavor to carry product liability insurance and obtain indemnities from our customers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts or that any insurance and customer indemnities will be adequate to defend against or satisfy any claims made against us. the costs associated with legal proceedings are typically high, relatively unpredictable and not completely within our control. even if we consider any such claim to be without merit, significant contingencies may exist, similar to those summarized in the above risk factor concerning intellectual property litigation, which could lead us to settle the claim rather than incur the cost of defense and the possibility of an adverse judgment. product liability claims in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation, and on our ability to attract and retain licensees and customers. risks related to this offering and owning our common stockprior to the completion of our initial public offering, there was no public trading market for our common stock.the offering under this prospectus is an initial public offering of our common shares. upon the completion of this offering, our common stock will commence trading on the nasdaq capital market, under the symbol atmr. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop a liquid market for our common shares. the stock market in general, and early stage public companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. if we are unable to develop a market for our common shares, you may not be able to sell your common shares at prices you consider to be fair or at times that are convenient for you, or at all.we are an emerging growth company under the jobs act of 2012 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.we are an emerging growth company, as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of 2012 (jobs act), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to: not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments; and extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards.we have chosen to opt out of the extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards, but we intend to take advantage of all of the other benefits available under the jobs act, including the exemptions discussed above. we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any june 30.our status as an emerging growth company under the jobs act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an emerging growth company, we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our reporting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. if we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.we have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends.we plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, to cover operating costs and otherwise become and remain competitive. we do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. we cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on the common stock we are offering.we will incur significant increased costs as a result of becoming a public company that reports to the securities and exchange commission and our management will be required to devote substantial time to meet compliance obligations.as a public company reporting to the securities and exchange commission, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. we will be subject to reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission that impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. in addition, on july 21, 2010, the dodd-frank wall street reform and protection act was enacted. there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the dodd-frank act that are expected to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. in addition, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. as a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.assuming a market for our common stock develops, shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock.we and all of our officers and directors have agreed not to sell, transfer or pledge, or offer to do any of the same, directly or indirectly, any of our securities for a period of 12 months following the close of this offering. all of our other common shares outstanding prior to this offering, including the 6,065,549 common shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes, are subject to lock-up agreements whereby the holder has agreed not to sell, transfer or pledge, or offer to do any of the same, directly or indirectly, any of our securities for a period 180 days following the close of this offering, subject to extensions under certain circumstances of up to a total of 216 days following our ipo. on the 181st day following the close of this offering (subject to the potential extension described above) and on every subsequent 31st day thereafter, 15% of such holders securities shall be released from the lock-up until the 366th day following the close of this offering, as of which none of such holders securities shall be subject to the lock-up. notwithstanding the lock-up agreements, we have agreed to register for resale 6,065,549 shares of common stock expected to be issued upon conversion of our convertible notes and 395,369 shares of common stock underlying warrants that are in addition to the warrants we will issue to the underwriter in connection with this offering. furthermore, commencing on the 90th day following the close of this offering, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to rule 144, promulgated under the securities act, subject to certain limitations. in general, pursuant to rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement (which disappears after one year). following the 180th day following the close of this offering, our stockholders will be eligible to begin publicly selling their shares under rule 144. any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus (including sales by investors of securities acquired in connection with this offering) may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.you will experience immediate dilution in the book value per share of the common stock you purchase.because the price per share of our common stock being offered is substantially higher than the book value per share of our common stock, you will experience substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the common stock you purchase in this offering. based on the offering price of $7.50 per share, if you purchase shares of common stock in this offering, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of $5.02 per share in the net tangible book value of the common stock at march 31, 2016.our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.upon the closing of this offering, provisions of our certificate of incorporation (certificate) and bylaws and applicable provisions of delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. the provisions in our certificate and bylaws: limit who may call stockholder meetings; do not permit stockholders to act by written consent; do not provide for cumulative voting rights; and provide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum. in addition, once we become a publicly traded corporation, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may limit our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied. this restriction lasts for a period of three years following the share acquisition. these provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. this potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.our bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the company.our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the court of chancery of the state of delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information in this prospectus, prior to making a decision to purchase shares of our common stock. this prospectus contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. if any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. risks related to our business we have incurred operating losses and net losses in the past and may incur additional losses in the future. if we fail to increase our revenues to offset our expenses, we may not become profitable. we have incurred operating losses in the past and we may incur additional operating losses in the future. we incurred operating losses of approximately $1.2 million in 2004 and $2.8 million in 2005, while generating operating income of $0.5 million in 2006. we have also incurred net losses of approximately $1.4 million in 2004, $1.5million in 2005 and $0.5 million in 2006. as of september 30, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $41.1 million. in addition, we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our sales and marketing activities, increase our technology development efforts, hire additional personnel and comply with the requirements related to being a public company. if we cannot increase our revenues enough to offset these expected increased expenses, or the increase in expenses exceeds our expectations, we may never become profitable.the industry in which we operate is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future, which will make it more difficult for us to sell our services and may result in pricing pressure, reduced revenue and reduced market share. the market for teleradiology is new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. we expect competition may intensify in the future, since barriers to entry for any licensed radiologist are not significant and the necessary technology is reasonably accessible. we compete directly with both large and small-scale service providers who offer local, regional and national operations. we believe that our principal competitor is nighthawk radiology holdings, inc., or nighthawk, which completed its initial public offering in 2006 and, as a result, raised a significant amount of capital and currently has greater financial resources than we have. certain of our competitors, including nighthawk, may be better known in the marketplace. some of our competitors may offer their services at a lower price, which may result in pricing pressure. if we are unable to maintain our current pricing, our operating results could be negatively impacted. moreover, pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced revenue and reduced profits. in addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors or if companies larger than we are enter the market through internal expansion or acquisition of one of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. these competitors could have established customer relationships and greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we have, and could be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services. this competition could harm our ability to sell our services, which could lead to lower prices, reduced revenue and, ultimately, reduced market share. nighthawk acquired our other principal competitor, the radlinx group, in 2007. we have a limited operating history, and the industry in which we operate continues to develop. we have a limited operating history in an emerging industry. as a result, our current business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate. you should consider us a company that is in the development stage, and subject to all of the ordinary risks associated with a new company in a rapidly evolving market. these risks include our need to: attract additional customers; continue to provide high levels of service quality to customers as we expand our business; quickly engage and integrate new radiologists and other key personnel; manage rapid growth in personnel and operations; respond to changing technologies and customer preferences; effectively manage our medical liability risk; and develop new services that complement our existing business. we may not be able to successfully address these risks. failure to adequately do so would harm our business and cause our operating results to be negatively impacted. furthermore, our limited operating history has resulted in revenue growth rates that we may not be able to sustain, and therefore may not be indicative of our future results of operations. as a result, the price of our common stock could decline.our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely affect our business and our operating results. we are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we also anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in the scope of our operations and size of our customer base. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our current senior management team, including our new president and chief operating officer and our new chief technology officer, to effectively manage this growth, as well as to effectively manage the transition to being a publicly traded company. our management will be required to devote considerable time to this process, which will reduce the time our management will have to implement our business and expansion plans. to effectively manage our business and planned growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management processes and controls and our reporting systems and procedures. furthermore, the additional headcount we are adding will increase our costs, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. if we are unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenues could decline or grow more slowly than expected and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.we are currently subject to, and we may in the future become subject to additional, intellectual property rights claims, which could harm our business and operating results. the information technology industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. on july 31, 2007, merge emed, inc., or merge, filed a complaint against vrc in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia, atlanta division, alleging that vrc has willfully infringed on certain of merges patents relating to teleradiology. merge is seeking treble damages as well as its costs and legal fees in pursuing the action. merge has asked the court for an injunction, ordering us to cease the alleged infringement of their patents, and also that the case be tried before a jury. while we are continuing to evaluate merges allegations, we intend 12 to defend against its claim. we may incur substantial costs defending against this claim. on september 14, 2007, we filed a request for reexamination with the united states patent and trademark office, or us pto, for the patents that merge has asserted against us, which asks the us pto to reexamine the validity of those merge patents. there is no assurance that the us pto will grant our request. in addition, on september 17, 2007, we filed a motion with the united states district court for the northern district of georgia, atlanta division, asking the court to stay the proceeding that merge had commenced in that court pending the outcome of our request for reexamination. there is no assurance the court will grant our motion. on october2, 2007, merge filed a response to our motion stating that it does not oppose our request to stay the proceeding pending the decision on our request for reexamination. we are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding and we may become subject to a damage award, which could cause us to incur additional losses and adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and/or our cash flows. in addition, we may be required to seek to re-engineer our technology, to obtain licenses from merge to continue using our technology without substantial re-engineering, or to seek to remove the accused functionality or feature as a result of the merge claim. we could also be forced to take similar measures in the event that another party asserts that our technology violates that partys proprietary rights or if a court holds that our technology violates such rights. in addition, we license software and systems from third parties under agreements that typically provide that the licensor will indemnify us against infringement claims by third parties. notwithstanding such indemnification, if we become involved in intellectual property litigation it will be expensive and time consuming and could divert managements attention away from running our business. monitoring potential infringement of our intellectual property rights and defending or asserting our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.if we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified radiologists, our future growth would be limited and our business and operating results would be negatively impacted. our success is highly dependent upon our continuing ability to recruit and retain qualified radiologists through vrp or similar affiliated practices to perform radiological services for us despite the current shortage of radiologists in the medical profession. we face competition for radiologists from other healthcare providers, including radiology practices, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. the competitive demand for radiologists may require us in the future to offer higher compensation in order to secure the services of radiologists. as a result, our compensation expense for our affiliated radiologists may increase and if we were not able to offset any such increase by increasing our prices, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. an inability to recruit and retain radiologists would have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and would adversely affect our results of operations.if we are unable to obtain proper physician licenses or hospital credentials on behalf of our affiliated radiologists, or if our affiliated radiologists lose those licenses or credentials, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. pursuant to hospital policies, each of our affiliated radiologists must be granted credentials to practice at each hospital from which the radiologist receives radiological images and, pursuant to state regulations, each of our affiliated radiologists must hold a license in good standing to practice medicine in the state in which the hospital is located and in the state in which the doctor is located. the requirements for obtaining and maintaining hospital credentials and state medical licenses vary significantly among hospitals and states. if a hospital or state restricts or impedes the ability of physicians located outside that particular state to obtain credentials or a license to practice medicine at 13 that hospital or in that state, the market for our services could be reduced. for the nine months ended september30, 2007, approximately 45.0% of our revenues from reads were generated from customers located in texas(11.7%), new york (8.5%), massachusetts (8.1%), missouri (6.4%), california (5.2%) and illinois (5.1%). thus, any change in the requirements for obtaining and maintaining physician licenses and hospital credentials in those states in particular could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. while we maintain a staff of specially trained employees to process the necessary applications to obtain these licenses and credentials, any delay in obtaining new licenses or credentials could create a shortage of affiliated radiologists available to perform reads for a particular customer. in addition, any loss of existing credentials or medical licenses held by our affiliated radiologists could impair our ability to serve our existing customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.if our affiliated radiologists are characterized as employees, we would be subject to employment and withholding liabilities. through our affiliated medical practices, we structure our relationships with our affiliated radiologists in a manner that we believe results in independent contractor relationships, not employee relationships. an independent contractor is generally distinguished from an employee by his or her degree of autonomy and independence in providing services. a high degree of autonomy and independence is generally indicative of a contractor relationship, while a high degree of control is generally indicative of an employment relationship. if tax or regulatory authorities or state or federal courts were to determine that our affiliated radiologists are employees, and not independent contractors, we would be required to withhold income taxes, to withhold and pay social security, medicare and similar taxes and to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes. we would also be liable for unpaid past taxes and subject to penalties. as a result, any determination that our affiliated radiologists are our employees would materially harm our business and operating results.we may be unable to enforce non-compete agreements with our affiliated radiologists. the independent contractor agreements with our affiliated radiologists typically provide that the radiologists may not engage in the teleradiology business, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of time, typically one year, after the agreements terminate. these covenants not to compete are enforceable to varying degrees from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. in most jurisdictions, a covenant not to compete will be enforced only to the extent that it is necessary to protect the legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement, that it does not unreasonably restrain the party against whom enforcement is sought and that it is not contrary to the public interest. this determination is made based upon all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought. it is unclear whether our interests will be viewed by courts as the type of protected business interest that would permit us to enforce non-competition covenants against our affiliated radiologists. because our success depends in substantial part on our ability to preserve the services of our affiliated radiologists, a determination that these provisions are not enforceable could have a material adverse effect on us.we are dependent upon certain key employees and the loss of their services may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner. our success depends largely upon the continued services of sean casey, m.d., our chief executive officer, chairman of the board of directors and founder. the loss of dr.casey could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are also dependent, to a lesser extent, on the services of our other executives and employees, the loss of whose services may also have such effects. in addition, the search for replacements could be time consuming and could distract our management team from the day-to-day operations of our business. if we are unable to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner, and to comply with sections 302 and 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, may be adversely affected. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, including disclosure controls and procedures. in particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing on our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act commencing with the year ending december 31, 2008. in connection with their audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december31, 2005 and reviews of our financial statements for certain interim quarterly periods in 2006, our independent registered public accounting firm determined material weaknesses existed in our internal controls over financial reporting because we lacked a sufficient complement of accounting personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge to account for certain complex, non-routine transactions, includingnon-employee stock-based compensation, variable interests andpreferred stock financing transactions. these material weaknesses resulted in the previously disclosed restatement of our 2004 and 2005 consolidated annual financial statements, and the restatement of our financial statements for certain interim periods in 2006. our management has taken steps to address these material weaknesses and improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including the hiring and training of additional experienced financial personnel and the implementation of additional internal control policies and procedures; accordingly, as of june 30, 2007, we were able to remediate the previously identified material weaknesses. we may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we take will ensure that we are able to implement and maintain adequate internal controls over our financial reporting in the future. any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for the year ending december 31, 2008 and in future periods as required by section 404, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. failure to comply with section 404 could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the securities and exchange commission or other regulatory authorities.interruptions or delays in our or our customers information systems or in network or related services provided by third party suppliers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. our operations depend on the uninterrupted performance of our information systems, which are dependent in part on systems provided by third parties over which we have little control. failure to maintain reliable information systems, or the occurrence of disruptions in our information systems, could cause delays in our business operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have infrequently experienced downtime due to disruptions in services provided by a third party or associated with implementation of improvements to our system. although our systems have been designed around industry-standard architecture to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to risks such as internet service denial attacks, security breaches, natural catastrophes affecting the geographic availability of internet access, unreliable internet performance due to 15 increased traffic over the internet, or changes in internet protocols that render the technologies we rely on inefficient. despite any precautions that we may take, the occurrence of such risks or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause permanent harm to our reputation and brand and could cause customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors. in addition, if any of our customers experience any problems with respect to their own internal information technology infrastructure, this could lead to a decrease in the number of reads they ask us to perform on their behalf. because our customers use our services for critical healthcare needs, any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses and reputations. these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses. any claim for compensation, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly for us to resolve.if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to patient or customer data, we may face liabilities and our system may be perceived as not being secure, causing customers to curtail or stop using our services, which could lead to a decline in revenues. we are required to implement administrative, physical and technological safeguards to ensure the security of the patient data that we create, process or store. these safeguards may fail to ensure the security of patient or customer data, thereby subjecting us to liability, including civil monetary penalties and possible criminal penalties. if our security measures are breached, whether as a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to patient or customer data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.any failure to protect our intellectual property rights in our workflow technology could impair its value and our competitive advantage. we rely heavily on our proprietary workflow software to transmit radiological images to the appropriately licensed and credentialed radiologist who is best able to provide the necessary clinical insight in the least amount of turnaround time. if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competition may gain access to our technology and our business may be harmed. we currently do not hold any patents with respect to our technology. we have filed seven provisional patent applications, one utility patent application and one international patent application covering certain aspects of our business processes and proprietary workflow software and we may file additional applications in the future. however, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for this technology. many of our intellectual property rights, including licenses for certain software and systems, are not exclusive or proprietary and may be imitated or purchased by competitors.our ability to update our workflow technology may be limited because we are dependent upon a third party to make corresponding enhancements to its software. we license certain image management software from fujifilm medical systems u.s.a., or fujifilm, a minority stockholder of vrc. we do not own the source code for the software that we license from fujifilm. therefore, when we make certain updates or enhancements to our workflow system, we are dependent upon fujifilm to provide similar enhancements to the licensed software in order to accommodate the enhancements to our system. fujifilm owns all rights in its software and all enhancements and modifications to its software. in the event that fujifilm fails, or is unable, to make any such enhancements to the licensed software, our ability to effectively update and enhance our workflow system could be limited. if our arrangements with our affiliated radiologists or our customers are found to violate state laws prohibiting the practice of medicine by general business corporations or fee splitting, our business, financial condition and ability to operate in those states could be adversely affected. the laws of many states, including states in which our affiliated radiologists perform medical services, prohibit us from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as splitting professional fees with physicians. these laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. we enter into agreements with our affiliated radiologists pursuant to which they render professional medical services. in addition, we enter into agreements with our customers to deliver professional radiology interpretation services in exchange for a service fee. we structure our relationships with our affiliated radiologists and our customers in a manner that we believe is in compliance with prohibitions against the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting. while we have not received notification from any state regulatory or similar authorities asserting that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that the payment of service fees to us by our customers constitutes fee splitting, if such a claim were successful we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties and could be required to restructure or terminate the applicable contractual arrangements and our contractual arrangements may be unenforceable in that particular state. a determination that our arrangements with our affiliated radiologists and our customers violate state statutes, or our inability to successfully restructure these arrangements to comply with these statutes, could eliminate customers located in certain states from the market for our services, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.as a result of our corporate structure, we are entirely dependent upon our affiliated medical practices, which we do not own. our services are provided to our customers by vrc and our affiliated medical practices. see our structure and affiliated radiologists. we provide our services through contracts between our customers and vrc, and through contracts between our customers and one of our affiliated medical practices. however, we do not own our affiliated medical practices. vrp is owned by dr.sean casey, dr.eduard michel, dr.gary weiss and dr.david hunter. in addition, each of the professional corporations is wholly-owned by dr.casey. while the ownership of our affiliated medical practices is subject to certain restrictions contained in management agreements between vrc and each of them, any change in our relationship, whether resulting from a dispute between the entities, a change in government regulation, or the loss of these affiliated medical practices, could impair our ability to provide services and could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and operations. because many states prohibit the practice of medicine by a general business corporation, we have structured our operations and our relationship with our affiliated medical practices such that approximately 47% of our revenue is generated from our professional corporations that perform services in such states. accordingly, our revenue may be adversely affected by a change in our relationship with the professional corporations. additionally, all of the medical services provided on behalf of us and the professional corporations are performed by independent contractor physicians under contract to vrp, and all compensation paid to such radiologists in consideration of those services is paid by vrp. any disruption of the arrangement between us and vrp or our other affiliated medical practices, whether resulting from a dispute between the entities, a change in government regulation, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. we have concluded that vrc is required to consolidate the affiliated medical practices for financial reporting purposes. through consolidation, we recognize all net losses of each affiliated 17 medical practice in excess of the equity of that affiliated medical practice. we recognize net earnings of each affiliated medical practice only to the extent we are recovering losses previously recognized with respect to that affiliated medical practice. earnings of each affiliated medical practice in excess of losses previously recognized by us with respect to that affiliated medical practice are excluded from our earnings and are attributed to the respective equity owners of that affiliated medical practice by recording such earnings as non-controlling interest on our consolidated financial statements. as a result of this ownership structure among vrc and its affiliated medical practices, certain future profits or losses may not inure to the stockholders of vrc.enforcement of federal and state anti-kickback laws could affect our business, operations or financial condition. various federal and state laws govern financial arrangements among healthcare providers. the federal anti-kickback law prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or with the purpose to induce, the referral of medicare, medicaid or other federal healthcare program patients, or in return for, or with the purpose to induce, the purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare, medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. similarly, many state laws prohibit the solicitation, payment or receipt of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral of patients in private as well as government programs. there is a risk that an investment in our shares by our affiliated radiologists, including the distribution of any profits to our affiliated radiologists, the use of our equipment by physicians who own our securities, any assistance from healthcare providers in acquiring, maintaining or operating digital diagnostic imaging equipment, the marketing of our affiliated radiologists services or our compensation arrangements with our affiliated radiologists may be considered a violation of these laws. violation of these anti-kickback laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties for individuals or entities and/or exclusion from participating in federal or state healthcare programs. if we are excluded from federal or state healthcare programs, our customers who participate in those programs would not be permitted to continue doing business with us. we believe that we are operating in compliance with applicable law and believe that our arrangements with providers would not be found to violate the anti-kickback laws. however, these laws could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our operations.federal or state self-referral regulations could impact our arrangements with our affiliated radiologists. the federal physician self-referral statute, known as the stark statute, prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services, including radiology </td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. investing in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. any of the following factors could harm our business and future results of operations and could result in a partial or complete loss of your investment. these risks are not the only ones that we may face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations and hinder our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders. risks related to our business and properties our initial portfolio of properties, together with our three option properties, are all located in greater washington, d.c. and any downturn in the areas economy may negatively affect our operating results. all of our initial properties and option properties are located in greater washington, d.c. as a result of this geographic concentration, we are exposed to greater economic risks than if we owned a more geographically-diverse portfolio of properties. in addition, nine of our 10 initial properties are located in northern virginia, a real estate market which we believe has only recently emerged from a period of higher vacancy and lower rental rates, as compared to historical rates. greater washington, d.c., and more specifically, northern virginia, is distinguished by a high concentration of professional service firms, technology and telecommunications companies, federal and local government agencies and various trade groups and associations. adverse economic developments affecting one or more of these groups, including decreased procurement spending by the u.s. government, outsourcing, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, businesses relocations, changing demographics, acts of terrorism, infrastructure quality, increases in real estate and other taxes, costs associated with government regulations or increased regulation, and other factors, including the potential for decreased u.s. government leasing in greater washington, d.c. as a result of the department of defenses recently adopted base realignment and closure initiative, may significantly affect the occupancy, rental rates and value of our properties, which may negatively affect our results of operations.the consideration paid by us for the properties and other rights being contributed to us as part of the formation transactions may exceed the fair market value of these assets. we have not obtained recent third-party appraisals of the 10 properties in our initial portfolio. the amount of consideration we will pay in exchange for these 10 properties and the other rights being contributed as part of the formation transactions is based on managements estimate of fair market value, including an analysis of market sales comparables, market capitalization rates for other properties and general market conditions for such properties. the amount of consideration we will pay was not determined as a result of arms-length negotiations and managements estimate of fair market value has not been approved by our independent trustee nominees and may exceed the appraised fair market value of these assets, if an appraisal were obtained. in addition, some of our executive officers and trustees, who had significant influence in structuring the formation transactions, had pre-existing ownership interests in the properties and rights to be contributed to us in the formation transactions and will receive substantial economic benefits as a result of these transactions. these executive officers and trustees, in the course of structuring the formation transactions, had the ability to influence the type and level of benefits that they and our other executive officers and trustees will receive from us. we depend on a limited number of significant tenants and a payment delinquency, bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more of these tenants could adversely affect the income produced by our properties, which may harm our operating performance. we are dependent on a limited number of significant tenants at our properties. our 10 largest tenants represented approximately 65.6% of our total annualized rent for all leases in which tenants were in occupancy as of november1, 2005. in particular, our largest tenant, the u.s. department of justice, represented approximately 22.5% of our total annualized rent for all leases in which tenants were in occupancy as of november1, 2005. the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more of our tenants may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. if a tenant defaults on a lease with us, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights. if a tenant files for bankruptcy, we cannot evict the tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. a bankruptcy court, however, could authorize a tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. in such case, our claim against the tenant for unpaid rent would be subject to a statutory limit that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease. under any circumstances, it is unlikely that a bankrupt tenant will pay, in full, amounts owed to us under a lease. the loss of rental payments from tenants and the costs of re-leasing may adversely affect our cash flows and operating results, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.if one or more of our tenants with early termination rights terminates their lease with us and we are unable to secure a replacement tenant on at least as favorable terms, our cash flows and operating results would be adversely impacted. several of our tenants lease space from us under leases that afford these tenants the right to terminate those leases, in whole or in part, prior to the scheduled expiration of the leases. these tenants lease an aggregate of approximately 231,840 net rentable square feet from us with a total annualized rent of approximately $5.6million, or approximately 13.1% of our total annualized rent, as of november1, 2005. additionally, four of our 22 leases in which tenants occupy more than 25,000 net rentable square feet have early termination provisions that typically allow the tenant to terminate its lease with us during the seventh or eighth year of a 10-year lease. if one or more of our tenants with early termination rights terminates its lease and we are unable to secure a replacement tenant on at least as favorable terms, our operating results, cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or meet our financial obligations would be adversely affected.we may be unable to renew existing leases or re-let space on terms similar to the existing leases, or at all, as leases expire, or we may expend significant capital in our efforts to re-let space, which may harm our operating performance. leases representing approximately 7.9% of our net rentable square feet (or annualized rent of approximately $4.4 million) at our properties will expire before december31, 2006, assuming no exercise of earlyterminationrights.inaddition,we believe that approximately 65% of the rent being paid under those leases expiring before december31, 2006 is currently at above-market rental rates. we may not be able to renew leases with our existing tenants or we may be unable to re-let space to new tenants if our current tenants do not renew their leases. even if our tenants renew their leases or we are able to re-let the space, the terms and other costs of renewal or re-letting, including the cost of required renovations, increased tenant improvement allowances, leasing commissions, declining rental rates and other potential concessions, may be less favorable or more costly than the terms of our current leases or than we anticipate and could require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. if we are unable to renew leases or re-let space in a reasonable time, or if rental rates decline or tenant improvement, leasing commissions or other costs increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our future growth is dependent on the acquisition of our three option properties and our growth may be harmed if our option agreements are terminated upon a change in control of our company or our independent trustees do not approve an acquisition of one or more of the option properties. we have entered into agreements with entities affiliated with some of our executive officers and trustees (contributors) granting us the option to acquire properties representing an estimated 1.1million net rentable square feet of office space. the terms of these agreements allow us to purchase a property during a period beginning from the receipt of a certificate of occupancy and continuing until 60 days prior to the maturity (including any extensions) of any construction loans on the property. in addition, in the event we do not exercise our initial option on a property, and the property is not sold to a third party, we have a second option to purchase a property during the period beginning 180 days after the expiration of the initial option and continuing through the fourth anniversary of the receipt of the propertys certificate of occupancy. currently, only the portals iii and republic square i are under development and we cannot assure you when these properties or republic square ii will receive their certificates of occupancy, if at all. the development of republic squareii depends upon the successful build out and lease-up of republic squarei and any delays or difficulties encountered may delay the possible exercise of our options and therefore harm our growth. our growth is dependent on our ability to acquire these three properties. in addition, the option agreements contain provisions which permit the seller to terminate an agreement if a change in control of our company occurs. our ability to acquire these properties, therefore, is subject to several risks, including that one or more of the properties is not ultimately developed, that the option is terminated upon a change in control and that our independent trustees do not approve our acquisition of one or more of the properties. our purchase of any of these three properties could subject us to a number of additional risks, including our inability to meet expected occupancy and rent levels, if at all. in addition, any purchase by us of an option property may involve the issuance of op units, which would have a dilutive impact on the holders of our common shares and op units. in evaluating whether or not to acquire an option property, we may make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property and may underestimate the costs associated with achieving full occupancy of the newly-acquired property. our operating flexibility and ability to sell any of the option properties that we may later acquire may be economically prohibited by certain tax protection obligations. in connection with the option properties, we have agreed with the property owners that if we exercise the option with respect to a property and dispose of an interest in that property in a taxable transaction within ten years of our exercise of the option to acquire that property, then we will indemnify the property owners and their direct and indirect owners for their tax liabilities attributable to the built-in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of the exercise of the option (as well as the tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment). although it may be in our shareholders best interest that we sell a property, it may be economically prohibitive for us to do so because of these obligations.certain of our trustees and executive officers, and their affiliates, have substantial ownership interests in our three option properties and these interests may conflict with your interests. mr.kramer, our chairman of the board, mr.keller, our chief executive officer, and mr.grigg, our president and chief development officer, and their affiliates, have substantial ownership interests in the three option properties over which we have options to acquire described under business and propertiesdevelopment. although any decisions regarding whether or not to purchase these properties in the future will be made by a vote of our independent trustees, we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by conflicts arising from messrs.kramer, grigg and kellers existing and ongoing economic interest in these properties. in particular, these conflicts could cause messrs.kramer, grigg and keller to divert their time and attention away from focusing on our business in an effort to enhance the value of the option properties for which they will receive direct and significant compensation upon exercise of our option. we face competition when pursuing fee-based development opportunities and our inability to capture these opportunities could negatively impact our growth and profitability. we selectively seek fee-based development opportunities for all real estate classes where we feel we can strengthen our position and prominence in a particular area or foster new investment and development opportunities. we face competition when pursuing these opportunities and these competitors may have more established contacts in a particular geographic region or more expertise in the development of real estate asset classes other than office properties. our inability to capture fee-based development opportunities could negatively impact our growth and profitability. in addition, we do not possess the same level of familiarity with the development of properties outside of greater washington,d.c., which could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties successfully, or at all, or to achieve expected performance.when providing fee-based development services, our right to receive fees for development services is typically subordinate to the rights of other creditors in connection with the construction of the property and as a result we may not be able to timely collect development fees, if at all, which could harm our operating results. as part of our growth strategy, we seek fee-based development opportunities for all real estate classes in various geographic areas both inside and outside of greater washington, d.c. typically, our right to receive fees for development services is subordinate to the rights of third-party creditors providing construction loans for the project. for example, the development services agreement entered into between us and the owner of republic square i provides that our rights to receive development fees are subordinate to the rights and interests of the lender under a construction loan agreement. as a result of these types of subordination provisions, we may be unable to collect fees earned by us for the development and construction of a project in a timely fashion, if at all, if a default under the construction loans has occurred or the creditor providing the construction loans has otherwise not been repaid, which could harm our results of operations. if we do not obtain or lose the right to provide fee-based development services for the city center project in the city of west palm beach, florida, our cash flows and operating results may be negatively impacted. as part of the formation transactions, republic properties corporation will contribute to us the right it currently has to provide fee-based development services to the city of west palm beach, florida to design, develop and construct an urban mixed-use development known as city center. our issuance of opunits to republic properties corporation in exchange for the contribution of its rights under the city center project is not contingent on the ultimate development of the project. the city of west palm beach city commission has recently considered the status of the project and while they voted to proceed with further development of plans and budgets, these plans and budgets have not been approved. in addition, the city of west palm beach must consent to the transfer of the rights to us and we are currently in the process of pursuing this required consent. if the city of west palm beach elects to abandon, or otherwise terminate, the project prior to the execution of final documentation, or if they do not consent to the transfer by republic properties corporation of their rights to us, we would lose the right to provide development services in connection with the project, which may have a negative impact on our cash flows and operating results.if we lose our right to provide management services on an outsource basis for the portals properties, our cash flows and operating results will be negatively impacted. as part of the formation transactions, we have entered into agreements with messrs.kramer and grigg and republic properties corporation, each general partners of pda, pursuant to which we will provide, on an outsource basis, management and development services for the portals properties in exchange for receiving a portion of the management or development fee, as the case may be, that is 26 payable to messrs.kramer and grigg and republic properties corporation with respect to each property. messrs.kramer and grigg and republic properties corporation, as general partners of pda, together with another unaffiliated general partner of pda, currently receive a fee for the management of the portals i and ii properties and a development fee for the portals iii. because our agreements to provide management and development services to the portals properties are with messrs.kramer and grigg and republic properties corporation and not with the entities that own the portals properties, we are not in privity of contract with these entities and do not have a direct right to enforce our agreements with these entities. accordingly, if pdas right to provide these services to the portals properties is terminated for any reason (whether or not we are at fault), we would lose our right to provide those management and/or development services to one or more of the portals properties, which would negatively impact our cash flows and operating results.we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions of office and office-oriented mixed-use properties meeting our criteria, which may impede our growth and negatively impact the price of our common shares. our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets or in consummating acquisitions on satisfactory terms, if at all. our ability to acquire office and office-oriented mixed-use properties on favorable terms may be constrained by competition from other investors with significant capital, including other publicly-traded reits and institutional investors. competition from these other potential acquirers may result in increased bidding, which may ultimately increase the price we must pay for a property or may result in us being unable to acquire a property at all. for example, we have acquired all but one of our initial properties in privately negotiated transactions outside of a competitive bidding process. if we are unable to continue to attract, negotiate and consummate these types of private transactions, we may be forced to expend substantial resources in acquiring properties in a competitive bidding process, if at all. failure to identify or consummate suitable acquisitions could cause us to grow at a slower rate than expected, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and reduce the price of our common shares.if we are not successful in efficiently integrating and operating the properties we acquire, managements attention may be diverted away from our day-to-day operations and we may experience other disruptions which could harm our results of operations. we will be required to integrate properties we acquire into our existing portfolio. the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated, because, for example, we do not realize anticipated operational or geographical synergies, which may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from our day-to-day operations, which could harm our results of operations.acquired properties may expose us to unknown liabilities which could harm our growth and future operations. we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities, such as liabilities to the government, tenants, third-party creditors, vendors or other persons, liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by parties entitled to be indemnified by the former owners of the properties. as a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon our ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle any such claim, which could harm our growth and future operations and result in a lowering of the price of our common shares. we face significant competition, which may impede our ability to retain tenants or re-let space when existing tenants vacate. we face significant competition for tenants in our properties from owners and operators of office and office-oriented mixed-use properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in greater washington, d.c. these competitors may possess greater expertise or flexibility in designing space to meet prospective tenants needs or may be more willing to make space available to prospective tenants at lower prices than comparable spaces in our properties, which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge these tenants.our operating results will be harmed if we are unable to fully lease-up vacant space at properties, such as presidents park i and ii, which were underperforming at the time we acquired them. as part of our acquisition strategy, we have acquired, and may in the future acquire, properties, such as presidents park i and ii, which we believe will result in favorable risk-adjusted returns on our investment but that have high vacancy rates upon acquisition. for example, presidents park i and ii were 20.3% occupied at the time we acquired these properties in december2004. these recently acquired properties may impede our operating performance and may take longer to achieve our anticipated investment return, if at all. costs associated with the lease-up of a recently acquired property may be higher than anticipated and, if achieved, may take longer to reach than we expect. to the extent our costs are higher than anticipated or we fail to lease these properties on favorable terms, or at all, we may not be able to lease-up the property, which may harm our operating results.future terrorist attacks in greater washington, d.c. could significantly impact the demand for, and value of, our properties. all of our initial properties and properties over which we have an option to acquire are located in greater washington, d.c., which has, in recent years, been a high risk geographical area for terrorism and threats of terrorism. future terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred on september11, 2001, and other acts of terrorism or war would severally impact the demand for, and value of, our properties. terrorist attacks in and around greater washington, d.c. could also directly impact the value of our properties through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs, and could thereafter materially impact the availability or cost of insurance to protect against such acts. a decrease in demand could make it difficult to renew or re-lease our properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates. to the extent that any future terrorist attacks otherwise disrupt our tenants businesses, it may impair their ability to make timely payments under their existing leases with us which would harm our operating results.uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow. we carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties and appropriate given the relative risk of loss and the cost of the coverage. some risks to our properties, such as losses due to terrorism, earthquakes or floods, are insured subject to policy limits which may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses. if we experience a loss which is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. in addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. in response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of september11, 2001, the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 (tria) was enacted in november2002 to mandate that insurance carriers offer insurance covering physical damage from terrorist incidents certified by the u.s. government as foreign terrorist acts. under tria, insurance carriers have a per occurrence deductible of $0.1 million and retain responsibility for 10% of the cost of each nuclear, chemical and biological certified event up to a maximum of $50million per occurrence. if the certified terrorism event is not found to be a 28 nuclear, chemical or biological event, the 10% exposure is limited to the $0.1 million deductible. the u.s. government is obligated to cover the remaining 90% of the loss above the deductible up to $100billion in the aggregate annually. our current insurance policy includes coverage for certified acts of terrorism, as governed by tria, and contains no specific exclusions specific to non-certified acts of terrorism. tria was originally set to expire on december31, 2004, which date was extended to december31, 2005 by the u.s. department of treasury on june18, 2004. on november 18, 2005, the u.s. senate passed the terrorism insurance extension act which, if passed into law, would extend tria until december 31, 2007. in its current form, the legislation reduces the amount of coverage that the u.s. government is required to provide and raises the deductibles for insurance carriers. such legislation may subsequently result in increased premiums charged by insurance carriers for terrorism insurance. while we cannot currently anticipate the final result of such legislation, we intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable. since the limit with respect to our portfolio may be less than the value of the affected properties, terrorist acts could result in property damage in excess of our coverage, which could result in significant losses to us due to the loss of capital invested in the property, the loss of revenues from the impacted property and the capital that would have to be invested in that property. any such circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations.if in the future we elect to make joint venture investments, we could be adversely affected by a lack of sole decision-making authority, reliance on joint venture partners financial condition and any disputes that might arise between us and our joint venture partners. we may invest in the future with third parties through joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, joint venture or other entity. in such event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, joint venture or other entity. investments in joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. likewise, partners may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. such investments may also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, because neither we nor our partner would have full control over the joint venture or other entity. disputes between us and partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and effort on our business. consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk. in addition, we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our partners. risks related to our debt financingrequired payments of principal and interest on our loan obligations may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations. required repayments of debt and related interest can adversely affect our operating performance. on a pro forma basis at september30, 2005, after this offering and the formation transactions, we expect to have approximately $230.0million of outstanding indebtedness, 100% of which will be secured. since we anticipate that our internally generated cash will be adequate to repay only a portion of our indebtedness prior to maturity, we expect that we will be required to repay debt through refinancings and/or public offerings. any offering of our equity securities to repay a portion of our indebtedness would result in the dilution of your ownership interest in us. the amount of our existing indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to repay debt through refinancing. if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties 29 on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us and which might adversely affect cash available for distributions to our shareholders. if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates on refinancing, our interest expense would increase, which could adversely affect our operating results. we also intend to incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions of real estate. we may, in some instances, borrow new funds to acquire properties. in addition, we may incur or increase our mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by some or all of the properties we acquire. we may also borrow funds if necessary to satisfy the requirement that we distribute to shareholders as distributions at least 90% of our annual taxable income (including net capital gains) and to avoid corporate level tax on our net taxable income, or otherwise as is necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. our substantial debt may harm our business and operating results, including by: requiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to pay interest, which reduces the amount available for distributions; placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions; and limiting our ability to borrow more money for operations, capital expenditures or to finance acquisitions in the future. our existing mortgage indebtedness contains, and any future mortgage indebtedness will contain, covenants that restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our existing mortgage indebtedness contains, and any future mortgage indebtedness may contain, certain covenants that apply to the property financed and our subsidiary that owns the property financed, which, among other things,

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the related notes and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. the occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. in such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. risks related to drug discovery, development and commercialization we are very early in our development efforts, which may not be successful. all of our product candidates are in the preclinical stage of development. we do not anticipate filing an ind for our lead product candidate, cd101 iv, until the second half of 2015. because of the early stage of our development efforts, we are still in the process of determining the clinical development path for our current and future product candidates. as a result, the timing and costs of the regulatory paths we will follow and marketing approvals remain uncertain. our ability to generate product revenue, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our early-stage product candidates. the success of cd101 iv, cd101 topical, and any other product candidates we may develop will depend on many factors, including the following: n successful completion of preclinical studies to enable submissions of inds; n successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; n demonstrating safety and efficacy; n receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; n establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; n obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity for our product candidates and technologies; n launching commercial sales of the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or selectively in collaboration with others; n acceptance of the product candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; n effectively competing with other therapies; n a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following approval; and n enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims. if we do not accomplish one or more of these goals in a timely manner, or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would harm our business.we may not be successful in our efforts to identify, discover, in-license or acquire potential product candidates. our cloudbreak immunotherapy platform and other drug discovery efforts may not be successful in identifying molecules that could be developed as drug therapies. our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. in particular, our research methodology used may not be successful in identifying compounds with sufficient potency or bioavailability to be potential product candidates. in addition, our potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other negative characteristics. research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. we may choose to focus our efforts and resources on potential product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. if we are unable to identify, in-license or acquire suitable compounds for preclinical and clinical development, we will not be able to generate product revenue, which would harm our financial position and adversely impact our stock price. to date, we have not in-licensed any such compounds. if clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates. before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. a failure of one or more clinical trials could occur at any stage of testing. the outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a particular clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results of that trial. moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to multiple interpretations and analyses. many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. for example, the high rate of correlation for clinical efficacy for antifungals and anti-infectives based on preclinical data may not apply for our current or future product candidates, and any of the potential benefits that we anticipate for human clinical use may not be realized. we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including that: n regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; n we may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites; n clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; n the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate; enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, clinical sites may drop out of our clinical trials or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; n our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; n regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks due to serious and unexpected side effects; n the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; n the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could require that we perform more studies than, or evaluate clinical endpoints other than, those that we currently expect; and n the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate. if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may: n be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates; n not obtain marketing approval at all; n obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; n obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings; n be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or n have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval. 12 product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or in receiving marketing approvals. we do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates, could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, any of which may harm our business and results of operations.we may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our cloudbreak immunology platform to build a pipeline of product candidates. a key element of our strategy is to use and expand our cloudbreak immunology platform to build a pipeline of development candidates and progress these through clinical development for the treatment of a wide variety of infectious diseases, including bacterial and viral infections. to date, the only development candidates that we have identified from the platform are antifungals, and they are in very early preclinical testing. even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential development candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. if we do not continue to successfully develop and eventually commercialize products, we will face difficulty in obtaining product revenues in future periods, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our share price.if we experience delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented. we may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the fda or analogous regulatory authorities outside the united states. in addition, some of our competitors may have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that would treat the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors product candidates. patient enrollment is also affected by other factors, including: n severity of the disease under investigation; n availability and efficacy of approved medications for the disease under investigation; n eligibility criteria for the trial in question; n perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study; n efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; n reluctance of physicians to encourage patient participation in clinical trials; n the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and n proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients. our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.if serious adverse effects or unexpected characteristics of our product candidates are identified during development, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some or all of our product candidates. all of our programs are in preclinical development and their risk of failure is high. it is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. if our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. for example, the pharmacokinetic properties, such as a longer half-life, that differentiate cd101iv from other echinocandins could have side effects that we have not anticipated and the consequences of such side effects could be more severe than has been seen with other echinocandins that have shorter half-lives or are dosed at lower concentrations than we expect for cd101iv. additionally, cd101 topical is the first application of an echinocandin anitfungal as a topical treatment and may have side effects related to the method of treatment delivery that are unexpected and different from those of other echinocandin antifungals. further, the treatment advantages that we 13 are predicting for cd101iv, such as lower healthcare costs resulting from an ability to administer cd101iv once-weekly or the predicted ability of cd101iv to be effective against resistant strains of fungal pathogens, may not be realized. in the biotechnology industry, many agents that initially show promise in early stage testing may later be found to cause side effects that prevent further development of the agent. in addition, fungal infections can occur in patients with co-morbidities and weakened immune systems, and there may be adverse events and deaths in our clinical trials that are attributable to factors other than investigational use of our product candidates.we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. we have limited financial resources. as a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.even if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success. if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community for us to achieve commercial success. if our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue to become profitable. the degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: n the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments; n the terms of any approvals and the countries in which approvals are obtained; n limitations or warnings contained in any labeling approved by the fda or other regulatory agency; n our ability to offer any approved products for sale at competitive prices; n convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments; n the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies or dosing regimens; n the willingness of physicians to prescribe these therapies and, in the case of cd101iv, transition to a once-weekly dosing regimen from traditional once-daily dosing; n the strength of marketing and distribution support; n the success of competing products and the marketing efforts of our competitors; n sufficient third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement; and n the prevalence and severity of any side effects.if, in the future, we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or to selectively enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved. we do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. to achieve commercial success for any approved product for which we retain sales and marketing responsibilities, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to other third parties. in the future, we may choose to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to sell some of our product candidates if and when they are approved. there are risks involved both with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and with entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. for example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. if the commercial launch of a product candidate 14 for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. this may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates on our own include: n our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel; n the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or to achieve adequate numbers of prescriptions for any future products; and n unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization. if we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenue or the profitability of these product revenues to us may be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. in addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. we may have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. if we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.we face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do. the development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. we face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. regulatory incentives to develop drugs for treatment of infectious diseases have increased interest and activity in this area and will lead to increased competition for clinical investigators and clinical trial subjects, as well as for future prescriptions, if any of our product candidates are successfully developed and approved. there are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the indications on which we are focusing our product development efforts. some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach and others are based on entirely different approaches. potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. cd101 iv will primarily compete with antifungal classes for the treatment of candidemia, which include polyenes, azoles and echinocandins. the approved branded therapies for this indication include cancidas (caspofungin, marketed by merck& co.), eraxis (anidulafungin, marketed by pfizer, inc.) and mycamine (micafungin, marketed by astellas pharma us, inc.). in addition, there are other generic products approved for candidemia, marketed by companies such as baxter healthcare corporation, mylan inc. and glenmark generics inc., among others. in addition to approved therapies, we expect that cd101 iv will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, including scy-078 (being developed by scynexis, inc.) and isavuconazole (being developed for the treatment of candidemia jointly by astellas pharma and basilea pharmaceutica ltd.). cd101 topical will primarily compete against azole agents (oral, topical and intravaginal), currently used in the treatment of vvc, as well as over-the-counter topical agents used to treat these conditions. the approved prescription therapies for vvc are diflucan (fluconazole) and terazol (terconazole). several over-the-counter topical agents such as monistat (miconazole), gyne-lotrimin (clotrimazole) or gynazole-1 (butoconazole) are also used to treat vvc. in addition to approved therapies, we expect that cd101 topical will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, including vt-1161 (being developed by viamet pharmaceuticals, inc.) and albaconazole (being developed by actavis plc). we intend to develop c001, the first development candidate from our cloudbreak immunotherapy platform, for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. the approved branded therapies for invasive aspergillosis are vfend (voriconazole, 15 marketed by pfizer, inc.) and cresemba (isavuconazole). there are other generic products approved for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis marketed by companies such as sandoz (a novartis company), teva pharmaceutical industries ltd and glenmark generics inc., among others. our competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. our competitors may also obtain marketing approval from the fda or other regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. many of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition, financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. these same competitors may invent technology that competes with our cloudbreak immunotherapy platform. these third parties may compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.even if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, these products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business. the regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. in the united states, new and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. in many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product-licensing approval is granted. in some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial marketing approval is granted. as a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a drug in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay its commercial launch, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenue we are able to generate from the sale of the drug in that country. adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval. our ability to commercialize any product candidates successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health programs, private health insurers and other third-party payors. third-party payors decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. a significant trend in the u.s. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of payment for particular medications. increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient. coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. if coverage and reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. there may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the fda or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states. moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. coverage and reimbursement rates may vary according 16 to the use of the drug and the medical circumstances under which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products or procedures or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the united states. commercial third-party payors often rely upon medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded programs and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize our approved products and our overall financial condition.product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit the commercialization of any product candidates we may develop. we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop after approval. if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: n decreased demand for any product candidates that we may develop; n injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; n withdrawal of clinical trial participants; n significant costs to defend any related litigation; n substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; n loss of revenue; and n the inability to commercialize any products we may develop. although we intend to obtain product liability insurance prior to the initiation of clinical trials, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. we anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage as we continue clinical trials and if we successfully commercialize any products. insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.if we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business. we are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. our operations also produce hazardous waste products. we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. in the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties. although we maintain workers compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees in our workplace, including those resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, chemical, hazardous or radioactive materials. in addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future envir</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before investing in our common stock. if any of the following risks materialize, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. in such case, the price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment. risks related to our business and industry our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult, and may increase the risk of your investment. you must consider the risks and difficulties we face as an early stage company with limited operating history. if we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed. we were formed in july 2003. we began delivering our first performance electric vehicle, the tesla roadster, in early 2008, and as of march31, 2010 we had only sold 1,063 production vehicles to customers, almost all of which were sold in the united states and europe. our revenues were $14.7 million for the year ended december31, 2008, $111.9 million for the year ended december31, 2009 and $20.8 million for the three months ended march31, 2010. we have a very limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business, operating results and prospects. to date we have derived our revenues principally from sales of the tesla roadster and related sales of zero emission vehicle credits, and to a lesser extent on products and services related to electric powertrain sales. we intend in the longer term to derive substantial revenues from the sales of our planned model s sedan electric vehicle which is at an early stage of development and which we do not expect to be in production until 2012. we have no operating history with respect to the model s electric vehicle and have only recently begun the component procurement process for the model s, which limits our ability to accurately forecast the cost of the vehicle. in addition, we recently announced that we have entered into an agreement to purchase a manufacturing facility in fremont, california to produce such vehicles, but we have not yet finalized the design or completed our engineering, manufacturing or component supply plans for the model s. in addition, to date our powertrain sales, development services revenue and powertrain research and development compensation have been exclusively generated under arrangements with daimler ag, or daimler, for the development and sale of a battery pack and a charger for daimlers smart fortwo electric drive. blackstar investco llc, or blackstar, an affiliate of daimler, holds more than 5% of our outstanding capital stock. other than our arrangements with daimler and its affiliates, we have not entered into any development or sales agreement for our electric powertrain business. there are no assurances that we will be able to secure future business with daimler or its affiliates. in may 2010, tesla and toyota motor corporation, or toyota, announced their intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles, and for tesla to receive toyotas support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for the model s. however, we have not entered into any agreements with toyota for any such arrangements, including any purchase orders, and we may never do so. it is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. for example, in the four most recent fiscal quarters ended march 31, 2010, we have recorded quarterly revenue of as much as $45.5 million and as little as $18.6 million and quarterly operating losses of as much as $26.0 million and as little as $4.3 million. in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial position could be materially affected. in addition, our revenues to date have included amounts we receive from selling zero emission vehicle, or zev, credits to other automobile manufacturers, pursuant to certain state regulations. we have entered into an agreement with american honda co., inc., or honda, in 2009 for the sale of zev credits that we earn from the sale of vehicles that we manufacture through december 31, 2011. as of march31, 2010, we had sold credits for 368 vehicles under this agreement and honda has an obligation to purchase additional credits earned from the 15 sale of any remaining vehicles that we manufactured in 2009 but sold in 2010 and from the sale of up to 287 additional vehicles manufactured in 2010 and 2011 prior to the expiration of the agreement. for the years ended december31, 2008 and 2009, and the three months ended march31, 2010, we recognized revenue from the sale of zev credits of $3.5 million, $8.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. we may not be able to enter into new agreements to sell any additional credits we may earn in excess of the current contractual amounts on equivalent terms and if this occurs, our financial results will be harmed.we have a history of losses and we expect significant increases in our costs and expenses to result in continuing losses for at least the foreseeable future. we incurred a net loss of $29.5 million for the three months ended march31, 2010 and have incurred net losses of approximately $290.2 million from our inception through march31, 2010. we have had net losses in each quarter since our inception. we believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin significant deliveries of the model s, which is not expected to occur until 2012, and may occur later. even if we are able to successfully develop the model s, there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful. if we are to ever achieve profitability it will be dependent upon the successful development and successful commercial introduction and acceptance of automobiles such as the model s, which may not occur. we expect the rate at which we will incur losses to increase significantly in future periods from current levels as we: design, develop and manufacture our planned model s; design, develop and manufacture components of our electric powertrain; develop and equip our planned manufacturing facility to produce our model s in fremont, california; build up inventories of parts and components for our model s; develop and equip manufacturing facilities to produce our electric powertrain components; open new tesla stores; expand our design, development, maintenance and repair capabilities; increase our sales and marketing activities; and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. because we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any incremental revenues with respect thereto, our losses in future periods will be significantly greater than the losses we would incur if we developed our business more slowly. in addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in increases in our revenues, which would further increase our losses. in addition, as of march31, 2010, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our united states net deferred tax assets as at this point we believe it is more likely than not that we will not achieve profitability and accordingly be able to use our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future. in addition, we have not yet determined whether this offering would constitute an ownership change resulting in limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred as a result of this offering, utilization of these assets could be significantly reduced.our future growth is dependent upon consumers willingness to adopt electric vehicles. our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for, alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular. if the market 16 for electric vehicles does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. the market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically electric vehicles, include: perceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of electric vehicles; perceptions about vehicle safety in general, in particular safety issues that may be attributed to the use of advanced technology, including vehicle electronics and regenerative braking systems, such as the possible perception that toyotas recent vehicle recalls may be attributable to these systems; the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge; the decline of an electric vehicles range resulting from deterioration over time in the batterys ability to hold a charge; concerns about electric grid capacity and reliability, which could derail our past and present efforts to promote electric vehicles as a practical solution to vehicles which require gasoline; the availability of alternative fuel vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine; the availability of service for electric vehicles; consumers desire and ability to purchase a luxury automobile or one that is perceived as exclusive; the environmental consciousness of consumers; volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline; consumers perceptions of the dependency of the united states on oil from unstable or hostile countries; government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy; access to charging stations, standardization of electric vehicle charging systems and consumers perceptions about convenience and cost to charge an electric vehicle; the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles or future regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles; perceptions about and the actual cost of alternative fuel; and macroeconomic factors. in addition, recent reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles. based on internal testing, we estimate that our tesla roadster would have a 5-10% reduction in range when operated in -20c temperatures. to the extent customers have concerns about such reductions or third party reports which suggest reductions in range greater than our estimates gain widespread acceptance, our ability to market and sell our vehicles, particularly in colder climates, may be adversely impacted. additionally, we may become subject to regulations that may require us to alter the design of our vehicles, which could negatively impact consumer interest in our vehicles. for example, our electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles. we are aware of advocacy groups, such as u.s. national federation of the blind, which are lobbying for regulations to require electric vehicle manufacturers to adopt minimum sound standards. 17 the influence of any of the factors described above may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles, which would materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.the range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time which may negatively influence potential customers decisions whether to purchase our vehicles. the range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. for example, a customers use of their tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the batterys ability to hold a charge. we currently expect that our battery pack will retain approximately 60-65% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles and 7 years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicles initial range. such battery deterioration and the related decrease in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles, which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles.the operation of our vehicles is different from internal combustion engine vehicles and our customers may experience difficulty operating them properly, including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking. we have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain. in certain instances, these protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles. for example, we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery in most modes of vehicle operation. our customers may become accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle. however, when the vehicle is at maximum charge, the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed. accordingly, our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking. in addition, we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures. in such instances, the vehicles acceleration and speed will decrease. finally, if the driver permits the battery to substantially deplete its charge, the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains. the vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a stop. despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge, the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected. there can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly, especially in these situations. any accidents resulting from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation, result in adverse publicity and product liability claims, and have a material adverse affect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. in addition, if consumers dislike these features, they may choose not to buy additional cars from us which could also harm our business and prospects.developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicles. significant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. for example, fuel which is abundant and relatively inexpensive in north america, such as compressed natural gas, may emerge as consumers preferred alternative to petroleum based propulsion. any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.if we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position. we may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and, as a result, may suffer a decline in our competitive position. any failure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a 18 decline in our competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in electric vehicle technology. as technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. however, our vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles. for example, we do not manufacture battery cells which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs.we are dependent upon our ability to fully draw down on our loan facility from the united states department of energy, which may restrict our ability to conduct our business. our plan for manufacturing the model s and for developing our electric powertrain facility depends on our ability to fully draw down on our loan facility from the united states department of energy, or the doe, under the does advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program, or atvm program. in january 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the federal financing bank, or the ffb, that is guaranteed by the doe and which we refer to as the doe loan facility. our doe loan facility provides for a $465.0 million loan facility under the does atvm program to help finance the continued development of the model s, including the planned build out and operation of a manufacturing facility, and to finance the planned build out and operation of our electric powertrain manufacturing facility. we cannot, however, access all of these funds at once, but only over a period of up to three years through periodic draws as eligible costs are incurred. through june 14, 2010, we have received draw-downs under our doe loan facility for an aggregate of $45.4million. our ability to draw down these funds under the doe loan facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions. for the models manufacturing facility project, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the model s and the planned models manufacturing facility, including an environmental assessment of such facility approved by the doe and the completion of the processes under the national environmental policy act, or nepa, and the california environmental quality act, or ceqa. for the electric powertrain manufacturing facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain manufacturing facility and the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. additionally, the doe loan facility will require us to comply with certain operating covenants and will place additional restrictions on our ability to operate our business. we are unaccustomed to managing our business with such restrictions and others that are associated with a significant credit agreement. if we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the doe loan facility, or our ability to make such draw downs is delayed, we may need to obtain additional or alternative financing to operate our models and electric powertrain manufacturing facilities to the extent our cash on hand is insufficient. any failure to obtain the doe funds or secure other alternative funding could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects. such additional or alternative financing may not be available on attractive terms, if at all, and could be more costly for us to obtain. as a result, our plans for building our models and electric powertrain manufacturing plants could be significantly delayed which would materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. our doe loan facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among others, a requirement that the project be conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the atvm program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, prepay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business and enter into certain restrictive agreements. these restrictions may limit our ability to operate our business and may cause us to take actions or prevent us from taking actions we believe are necessary from a competitive standpoint or that we otherwise believe are necessary to grow our business. our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers, which makes evaluating our business, operating results and future prospects difficult. our distribution model is not common in the automobile industry today, particularly in the united states. we plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicles over the internet and in company-owned tesla stores. this model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven, especially in the united states, and subjects us to substantial risk as it requires, in the aggregate, a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system. for example, we will not be able to utilize long established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase our sales volume, which may harm our business, prospects, financials condition and operating results. moreover, we will be competing with companies with well established distribution channels. as of june 14, 2010, we had opened 12 tesla stores in the united states and europe, 9 of which have been open for less than one year. we have only limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our tesla stores. as of march 31, 2010 we had only sold 1,063 tesla roadsters to customers, primarily in the united states and europe. our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies. implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenges, including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities, and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges. you must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties we encounter as we implement our business model. for instance, we will need to persuade customers, suppliers and regulators of the validity and sustainability of our business model. we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so, or to successfully address the risks, uncertainties and difficulties that our business strategy faces. any failure to successfully address any of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties related to our business model would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles. we sell our vehicles from our tesla stores as well as over the internet. we may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the united states as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to impose other limitations on this sales model, including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state. for example, the state of texas prohibits a manufacturer from being licensed as a dealer or to act in the capacity of a dealer, which would prohibit us from operating a store in the state of texas and may restrict our ability to sell vehicles to texas residents over the internet from out of state altogether without altering our sales model. the state of kansas provides that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a kansas resident except through a dealer licensed to do business in the state of kansas, which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of kansas in order to sell vehicles to kansas residents. in some states where we have opened a gallery, which is a location where potential customers can view our vehicles but is not a full retail location, it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturer-dealer laws. for example, the state of colorado required us to obtain dealer and manufacturer licenses in the state in order to operate our gallery in colorado. in addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities. the foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles. in many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a 20 physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. as a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, the manner in which the applicable authorities will apply their state laws to our distribution model is unknown. such laws, as well as other laws governing the motor vehicle industry, may subject us to potential inquiries and investigations from state motor vehicle regulators who may question whether our sales model complies with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws and who may require us to change our sales model or may prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states. to date, we are registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in california, colorado, florida, illinois and washington and we are licensed as a motor vehicle dealer in the state of new york. we have not yet sought formal clarification of our ability to sell our vehicles in any other states. furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles.we are significantly dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of our electric vehicles, specifically the tesla roadster, in the near term, and our future success will be dependent upon our ability to design and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models, and specifically the model s. we currently generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our tesla roadsters and the sale of the related zero emission vehicle credits. we began production of our tesla roadster only in 2008, and our second planned vehicle, our model s, is not expected to be in production until 2012, requires significant investment prior to commercial introduction, and may never be successfully developed or commercially successful. there can be no assurance that we will be able to design future models of performance electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models, including the model s, will become commercially viable. in particular, it is common in the automotive industry for the production vehicle to have a styling and design different from that of the concept vehicle, which may happen with the model s. we believe the design of the early prototype model s is one of the key reasons why we have received approximately 2,200 reservations for the vehicle as of march 31, 2010. to the extent that we are not able to build the production model s to the expectations created by the early prototype, customers may cancel their reservations and our future sales could be harmed. additionally, historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. in order to meet these expectations, we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. as technologies change in the future for automobiles in general and performance electric vehicles specifically, we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology. to date we have limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing and selling our electric vehicles.we anticipate that we will experience an increase in losses and may experience a decrease in automotive sales revenues prior to the launch of the model s. prior to the launch of our model s, we anticipate our automotive sales may decline, potentially significantly. we currently produce the tesla roadster gliders, which are partially assembled vehicles that do not contain our electric powertrain, with lotus in hethel, england. we currently intend to manufacture gliders with lotus for our 21 current generation tesla roadster until december 2011. we intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the tesla roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted. we do not currently plan to begin selling our next generation tesla roadster until at least one year after the launch of the model s, which is expected to be in production in 2012. as a result, we anticipate that we will generate limited revenue from selling electric vehicles in 2012 until the launch of our model s. the launch of our model s could be delayed for a number of reasons and any such delays may be significant and would extend the period in which we would generate limited revenues from sales of our electric vehicles. the potential decrease in automotive sales revenues for the periods prior to the launch of the model s may be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition and our ability to fund operating losses could seriously constrain our growth. furthermore, except for our arrangements with daimler and its affiliates, we do not currently have any arrangements in place with third parties for the development or purchase of components in our electric powertrain business. there are no assurances that we will be able to secure future business with daimler or its affiliates as it has indicated its i</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS Before you invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the various risks, including those described below, together with all of the other information included in this prospectus. Risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could cause our sales revenues to decreaseOur sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we were to lose one or more of these customers, or if one or more of these customers were to delay or reduce purchases of our products, our sales revenues may decrease. For the six months ended June 30, 1999, approximately 81% of our revenues were generated by five of our customers, and revenues derived from sales to Talent Trade Asia, TriGem and Silicon Application Corporation accounted for 42%, 20% and 10%, respectively, of our product sales. For the year ended December 31, 1998, approximately 60% of our revenues were generated by five of our customers, and revenues derived from sales to Silicon Application Corporation, BTC, Askey Computer and Zoltrix accounted for 15%, 13%, 12% and 12%, respectively, of our product sales. These customers may in the future decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns, because: . we do not have any long-term purchase arrangements or contracts with these or any of our other customers, . our product sales to date have been made primarily on a purchase order basis, which permit our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice and without penalty, and . many of our customers also have pre-existing relationships with current or potential competitors which may affect our customers' purchasing decisionsWe expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next 12 to 18 months and that a significant portion of our sales will continue to be made on the basis of purchase orders. We have significant sales and operations concentrated in Asia. Continued political and economic instability in Asia and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase market demand for our productsOur sales to customers located in Asia accounted for 74%, 77% and 76% of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively, and 77% and 99% of total revenues in the six months ended June 30, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The predominance of our sales are in Asia, mostly in Taiwan and China, because our customers are primarily motherboard or modem manufacturers that are located there. In many cases, our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers specify that our products be included on the modem boards or motherboards, the main printed circuit board containing the central processing unit of a computer system, that they purchase from board manufacturers, and we sell our products directly to the board manufacturers for resale to our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers. Industry statistics indicate that approximately two thirds of modems manufactured in Asia are sold back to original equipment manufacturers located in the United States. Due to the industry-wide concentration of modem manufacturers in Asia, we believe 7 that a high percentage of our future sales will continue to be concentrated with Asian customers. As a result, our future operating results could be uniquely affected by a variety of factors outside of our control, including: . political and economic instability, such as the recent political instability in Indonesia and the economic turmoil in Japan, . changes in tariffs, quotas, import restrictions and other trade barriers which may make our products more expensive compared to our competitors, . delays in collecting accounts receivable, which we have experienced from time to time, and . fluctuations in the value of Asian currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which may make it more costly for us to do business in Asia which may in turn make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our revenuesTo successfully expand our sales in Asia and internationally, we must strengthen foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international distributors and resellers. This will require significant management attention and financial resources. To the extent that we are unable to effect these additions in a timely manner, we may not be able to maintain or increase market demand for our products in Asia and internationally, and our operating results could be hurt. The recent earthquake in Taiwan and subsequent aftershocks may cause our revenues or profitability to decreaseBecause our products are sold to motherboard or modem manufacturer customers in Taiwan, the recent earthquake in Taiwan may result in less demand for our products and may cause our revenues to decrease. Our customers who are outside of Taiwan may also be dependent on other components manufactured in Taiwan. The recent earthquake may disrupt the operations of our customers' other suppliers who are located in Taiwan, and may result in a decrease in demand of our products. We are also dependent on our suppliers who manufacture product components in Taiwan. The recent earthquake may disrupt the operations of these suppliers. If they are not able to adequately supply us, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products. We do not currently believe that the effect of this earthquake on our business will be material. However, due to the nature of this disaster and the fact that its full impact on our business has not been fully evaluated, our sales to customers in Asia may be affected in the next few quarters. Continuing decreases in the average selling prices of our products could result in decreased revenuesProduct sales in the connectivity industry have been characterized by continuing erosion of average selling prices. Price erosion experienced by any company can cause revenues and gross margins to decline. The average selling price of our products has decreased by approximately 40% from October 1995 to June 30, 1999. We expect this trend to continueIn addition, we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards in the soft modem industry is likely to further erode average selling prices, particularly for analog modems. Adoption of industry standards is driven by the market requirement to have interoperable modems. End users need this interoperability to ensure modems from different manufacturers communicate with each other without problems. Historically, users have deferred purchasing modems until these industry standards are adopted. However, once these standards are accepted, it lowers the barriers to entry and price erosion has resulted. Decreasing average selling prices in our products could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units that we sell increases. Therefore, we must continue to develop and introduce next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins. Our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margin to decline. Our gross margins may vary based on the mix of sales of our products and services, and these variations may hurt our net incomeWe derive a significant portion of our sales from our software-based connectivity products. We expect margins on newly introduced products generally to be higher than our existing products. However, due in part to 8 the competitive pricing pressures that affect our products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs, we expect margins from both existing and future products to decrease over time. In addition, licensing revenues from our products historically have provided higher margins than of our product sales. Changes in the mix of products sold and the percentage of our sales in any quarter attributable to products as compared to licensing revenues will cause our quarterly results to vary and could result in a decrease in net income. Our revenues may fluctuate each quarter due to both domestic and international seasonal trendsWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in sales of our connectivity products. These seasonal trends materially affect our quarter-to-quarter operating results. Our revenues are higher during the back- to-school and holiday seasons which fall in the third and fourth calendar quarters. Revenue in our third and fourth quarters are typically higher relative to other quarters because many purchasers of PCs make purchase decisions based on their calendar year-end budgeting requirements. As a result, we generally expect revenue levels for the first quarter to be less than those for the preceding quarterWe are currently expanding our sales in international markets, particularly in Asia, Europe and South America. We expect our third quarter to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity and spending activity generally associated with that time of year, particularly in Europe. To the extent that our revenues in Asia, Europe or other parts of the world increase in future periods, we expect our period-to-period revenues to reflect seasonal buying patterns in these markets. Any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in customers cancelling purchases of our productsSales cycles for our products with major customers are lengthy, often lasting six months or longer. In addition, it can take an additional six months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products. Sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons: . our original equipment manufacturer customers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products, over which we have no control, before placing a purchase order, . the commercial integration of our products by an original equipment manufacturer is typically limited during the initial release to evaluate product performance, and . the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayedA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders. The lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases. If customer cancellations or product changes were to occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses. We expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future and these increased expenses may diminish our ability to remain profitableAlthough we have been profitable in recent years, we may not remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially over at least the next three years as we: . further develop and introduce new applications and functionality for our host signal processing technology, . explore emerging product opportunities in digital technologies and wireless and cable communications, . expand our distribution channels, both domestically and in our international markets, and . pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions. 9 In order to maintain profitability we will be required to increase our revenues to meet these additional expenses. Any failure to significantly increase our revenues as we implement our product, service, distribution and strategic relationship strategies would result in a decrease in our overall revenuesTo date, we have principally relied upon our distributor sales organization for product sales to smaller accounts. Our direct sales efforts have focused principally on board manufacturers and smaller PC original equipment manufacturers. To increase penetration of our target customer base, including large, tier-one original equipment manufacturers, we must significantly increase the size of our direct sales force and organize and deploy sales teams targeted at specific domestic tier-one original equipment manufacturer accounts. If we are unable to expand our sales to additional original equipment manufacturers, our revenues may not meet analysts' expectations which could cause our stock price to drop. We must accurately forecast our customer demand for our modem products. If there is an unexpected fluctuation in demand for our products, we may incur excessive operating costs or lose product revenuesWe must forecast and place purchase orders for specialized semiconductor chips, the application specific integrated circuit, coder/decoder and discrete access array, or data access arrangement, components of our modem products, several months before we receive purchase orders from our own customers. This forecasting and order lead time requirement limits our ability to react to unexpected fluctuations in demand for our products. These fluctuations can be unexpected and may cause us to have excess inventory, or a shortage, of a particular product. In the event that our forecasts are inaccurate, we may need to write down excess inventory. For example, we were required to write down inventory in the second quarter of 1996 in connection with a product transition within our 14.4 Kbps product family. Similarly, if we fail to purchase sufficient supplies on a timely basis, we may incur additional rush charges or we may lose product revenues if we are not able to meet a purchase order. These failures could also adversely affect our customer relations. Significant write- downs of excess inventory or declines in inventory value in the future could cause our net income and gross margin to decrease. We rely heavily on our intellectual property rights which offer only limited protection against potential infringers. Unauthorized use of our technology may result in development of products that compete with our products which could cause our market share and our revenues to be reducedOur success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. These means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate. We hold a total of 32 patents, a number of which cover technology that is considered essential for International Telecommunications Union standard communications solutions, and also have 26 additional patent applications pending or filed. These patents may never be issued. These patents, both issued and pending, may not provide sufficiently broad protection against third party infringement lawsuits or they may not prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Other than the Motorola and ESS lawsuits described elsewhere in this prospectus, to date, no material lawsuits relating to intellectual property have been filed against usDespite precautions that we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may provide our licensees with access to our proprietary information underlying our licensed applications. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology. Finally, policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and some foreign laws, including those of various countries in Asia, do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as United States laws. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resourcesWe have received, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. These claims could affect our relationships with existing customers and may prevent potential future customers from purchasing our products or licensing our 10 technology. Because we depend upon a limited number of products, any claims of this kind, whether they are with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In the event that we do not prevail in litigation, we could be prevented from selling our products or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms which may not be acceptable to us. We could also be prevented from selling our products or be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Should we cross license our intellectual property in order to obtain licenses, we may no longer be able to offer a unique productNew patent applications may be currently pending or filed in the future by third parties covering technology that we use currently or may use in the future. Pending U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents are issued, and thus it is impossible to ascertain all possible patent infringement claims against us. We believe that several of our competitors, including Motorola, Lucent and ESS Technology, may have a strategy of protecting their market share by filing intellectual property claims against their competitors and may assert claims against us in the future. The legal and other expenses and diversion of resources associated with any such litigation could result in a decrease in our revenuesIn addition, some of our customer agreements include an indemnity clause that obligates us to defend and pay all damages and costs finally awarded by a court should third parties assert patent and/or copyright claims against our customers. As a result, we may be held responsible for infringement claims asserted against our customers. If our financial reserves for potential future license fees are less than any actual fees that we are required to pay, our net income would be reducedWe have established and recorded on a monthly basis a financial per-unit reserve for payment of future license fees based upon our estimate as to the likely amount of the licensing fees that we may be required to pay in the event that licenses are obtained. We believe that it is typical for participants in the modem industry to obtain licenses in exchange for grants of cross licenses rather than for payment of fees and we have based our estimates on our understanding of the license fee practices of other segments of our industry. Our reserves may not be adequate because of factors outside of our control and because these license fee practices in the modern industry may not be applicable to our experience. Competition in the connectivity market is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for, or the prices of, our products may be reducedThe connectivity device market is intensely competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors. Our current competitors include 3Com, Conexant, ESS Technology, Lucent Technologies and Motorola. Motorola introduced soft modems in the third quarter of 1998 and Conexant introduced soft modems in the fourth quarter of 1998. We expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors enhance their product offerings, new suppliers enter the connectivity device market, new communication technologies are introduced and additional networks are deployedWe may in the future also face competition from other suppliers of products based on host signal processing technology or on new or emerging communication technologies, which may render our existing or future products obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. We believe that these competitors may include Alcatel, Analog Devices, Aware, Broadcom, Com21, Efficient Networks, Orckit, Terayon Communications and Texas InstrumentsWe believe that the principal competitive factors required by users and customers in the connectivity product market include compatibility with industry standards, price, functionality, ease of use and customer service and support. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. 11 We recently hired a new President and Chief Operating Officer. If he is not successful in carrying out his duties, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability or increase our revenueIn August 1999, we hired William F. Roach as our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Roach must be successfully integrated into our organizational structure. If for any reason Mr. Roach does not successfully carry out his duties or lead our organization in an effective manner, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability or increase our revenue. In order for us to maintain our profitability and continue to introduce and develop new products for emerging markets, we must attract and retain our executive officers and qualified technical, sales, support and other administrative personnelOur past performance has been and our future performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive officers and certain key engineering, sales, marketing, financial, technical and customer support personnel. If we lost the services of one or more of our executives or key employees, a replacement could be difficult to recruit and we may not be able to grow our businessWe maintain "key person" life insurance policies on Peter Chen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, William Wen-Liang Hsu, our Vice President, Engineering, and Han Yeh, our Vice President, Technology, in the face amount of $1 million for each individual. However, these insurance policies may not adequately compensate for the loss of services of any of these individualsWe intend to hire a significant number of additional engineering, sales, support, marketing and finance personnel in the future. Competition for personnel, especially engineers and marketing and sales personnel in Silicon Valley, is intense. We are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education, backgrounds and industry experience. As of June 30, 1999, we employed a total of 58 people in our engineering department, over half of whom have advanced degrees. In the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified engineering personnel, especially developers, on a timely basis. If we are not able to hire at the levels that we plan, our ability to continue to develop products and technologies responsive to our markets will be impaired. We have experienced significant growth in our business in recent periods and failure to manage our growth could strain our management, financial and administrative resourcesOur ability to successfully sell our products and implement our business plan in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective management planning process. Future expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on our management by significantly increasing the scope of their responsibilities and resources by increasing the number of people using them. We have increased, and plan to continue to increase, the scope of our operations at a rapid rate. Our headcount has grown and will continue to grow substantially. At December 31, 1998, we had a total of 95 employees and at June 30, 1999, we had a total of 125 employees. In addition, we expect to continue to hire a significant number of new employees. To effectively manage our growth, we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls, integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. We rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test our products. If these companies do not meet their commitments to us, our ability to sell products to our customers would be impairedWe do not have our own manufacturing, assembling or testing operations. Instead, we rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test the semiconductor chips which are integral components of our products. Most of these companies are located outside of the United States. There are many risks associated with our relationships with these independent companies, including reduced control over: . delivery schedules, . quality assurance, 12 . manufacturing costs, . capacity during periods of excess demand, and . availability of access to process technologiesIn addition, the location of these independent parties outside of the United States creates additional risks resulting from the foreign regulatory, political and economic environments in which each of these companies exists. While to date we have not experienced any material problems, failures or delays by our manufacturers to provide the semiconductor chips that we require for our products, or any material change in the financial arrangements we have with these companies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer product requirementsWe design, market and sell application specific integrated circuits and outsource the manufacturing and assembly of the integrated circuits to a third party fabrication. The majority of our products and related components are manufactured by five principal companies: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, ST Microelectronics, Kawasaki/LSI, Silicon Labs and Delta Integration. We expect to continue to rely upon these third parties for these services. Currently, the data access arrangement chips used in our soft modem products are provided by a sole source, Silicon Labs, on a purchase order basis, and we have only a limited guaranteed supply arrangement under a contract with our supplier. We are currently in the process of qualifying a second source for our data access arrangement chips. Although we believe that we would be able to qualify an alternative manufacturing source for data access arrangement chips within a relatively short period of time, this transition, if necessary, could result in loss of purchase orders or customer relationships, which could result in decreased revenues. Undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance of our productsOur products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released. To date, we have not been made aware of any significant software errors or failures in our products. However, despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance. If we, our key suppliers or our customers fail to be ready for the year 2000 calendar change, our business may be disrupted and our net revenues may declineThe Year 2000 issue refers to computer programs which use two digits rather than four to define a given year and which might read a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the Year 2000. As a result, many companies' systems and software may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to function correctly after December 31, 1999Our Software. Our connectivity products are incorporated into computer products of our customers which may not be Year 2000 compliant, or which may be perceived by their markets as not meeting Year 2000 compliance requirements. As a result, it is likely that any failure of the computer products into which our products may be incorporated to be Year 2000 compliant, or any slowdown in the connectivity markets as a result of Year 2000 compliance concerns, will hurt our product sales. In addition, we believe that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by Year 2000 issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or upgrade their current software systems for Year 2000 compliance. These expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase our products. To the extent Year 2000 issues cause a significant delay in, or cancellation of, decisions to purchase our products or services, our business would suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we test and evaluate our software modems. We believe that our current products are Year 2000 compliant, meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after January 1, 2000 will not materially affect the performance of our software products or the ability of our products to transmit data involving dates. 13 Third Party Equipment And Software. We use third party equipment and software that may not be Year 2000 compliant. This equipment and software includes our key internal systems such as for our internal accounting systems or controls. If this equipment or software does not operate properly with regard to the Year 2000, we may incur unexpected expenses to remedy any problems. These costs may materially adversely affect our business. In addition, if our key internal systems fail as a result of Year 2000 problems, we could incur substantial costs and disruption of our businessCompliance. Despite our current assessment, we may not identify and correct all significant Year 2000 problems on a timely basis. Year 2000 compliance efforts may involve significant time and expense and unremediated problems could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We currently do not have any estimate of potential costs related to potential Year 2000 problems. We currently do not have plans to contact our material customers. We currently have no contingency plans to address the risks associated with unremediated Year 2000 problems. To date, we have not incurred any material costs directly associated with Year 2000 compliance efforts, except for compensation expense associated with salaried employees who have devoted some of their time to Year 2000 assessment and remediation efforts. We do not expect the total cost of Year 2000 problems to be material to our business, financial condition or operating results. However, during the months prior to the century change, we will continue to evaluate new versions of our products, new software and information systems provided by third parties and any new infrastructure systems that we acquire, to determine whether they are Year 2000 compliant. Risks Related to Our Industry If the market for applications using our host signal processing technology does not grow as we anticipate, or if our products are not accepted in this market, our revenues may stagnate and may decreaseOur success depends on the growth of the market for applications using our host signal processing technology. This market has only recently begun to develop and may not develop at the growth rates that have been suggested by industry estimates. Market demand for host signal processing technology depends primarily upon the cost and performance benefits relative to other competing solutions. For example, soft modems have only recently begun to gain acceptance in the modem market. Although we have shipped a significant number of soft modems since we began commercial sales of these products in October 1995, the current level of demand for soft modems may not be sustained or may not grow. If customers do not accept soft modems or the market for soft modems does not grow, our revenues will decreaseFurther, we are in the process of developing next generation products and applications which improve and extend upon our host signal processing technology, such as a G.Lite modem solution, an external modem product and a remote access solution. If these products are not accepted in our markets when they are introduced, our revenues and profitability will be negatively affected. Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies. If we do not adapt to these technologies, our products will become obsoleteThe connectivity product mark</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all of the other information included in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any of the following risks could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate or materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition and could result in a complete loss of your investment. Risks Related to our Business We are not profitable and do not expect to achieve profitability in the near future, if at allWe have not achieved profitability. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We incurred net losses of $321,000 from inception through December 31, 1997. For the year ended December 31, 1998, we incurred additional net losses of $5.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, we incurred additional net losses of $16.0 million and had an accumulated deficit of $21.6 million as of September 30, 1999, and we expect to report additional net losses for the period since September 30, 1999Our business plan calls for us to continue to acquire and invest in operating companies. As a result, we will continue to amortize substantial amounts of goodwill. As we grow, we expect that the amount of goodwill we will amortize in connection with these investments will represent an increasingly smaller portion of our expenses. Therefore, we expect to continue to incur net losses until that point in time when the goodwill we amortize represents a sufficiently small amount of our expenses that it is exceeded by our net income before amortization. Because we cannot predict the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we do not know when we will become profitable, if ever. We have a history of negative cash flow, and we may never achieve positive cash flowFor the year ended December 31, 1998, we had losses from operations, before depreciation and amortization, of $4.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, we had losses from operations, before depreciation and amortization, of $9.0 million, and we expect to report additional losses for the period since September 30, 1999. Additionally, we used $14.3 million in 1998 and $61.3 million in the first nine months of 1999 to acquire operations and fixed assets. If we are unable to increase our revenue to cover our costs and investment expenditures, we will continue to experience negative cash flow. For information regarding our expected losses for the three months ended December 31, 1999, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis--Recent Developments" on page 24. We may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to execute our business planWe expect that the net proceeds of this offering will fund our operations for the next 12 months. After we have used the net proceeds from this offering, we will need to obtain additional debt or equity financings to fund operations, capital expenditures for expansion of network and information systems, and acquisitions. If we obtain debt financings, we may be required to agree to restrictions on our activities that could impair our ability to execute our business plan. For example, these restrictions may prohibit us from incurring additional debt or making acquisitions without prior lender approval. If we obtain additional equity financings, the per share value of our outstanding common stock may be diluted. In general, if we are unable to obtain these financings on favorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plan. Our combined operating history is limited and may not be indicative of our future performanceAlthough a number of the operating companies we have acquired have been in operation for some time, VIA itself has a limited history of operations. Consequently, the financial information in this prospectus may not be indicative of our future performance. 6 Because we have grown rapidly and we expect our growth to continue, we may have difficulty managing our growth effectively, which could adversely affect the quality of our services and the results of our operationsWe have grown rapidly and expect to continue to grow rapidly by acquiring new companies, increasing the number of customers served and increasing the number and types of products and services we offer. We have acquired 19 companies since June 1998, and agreed to acquire one other company, and the total number of our employees grew from five to 903 between June 1, 1998 and January 14, 2000. To manage our expected growth effectively, we must . implement additional management information systems . develop additional operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls . hire and train additional personnelIf we are unable to meet these demands, the quality of our services may suffer, causing us to lose customers and revenues. If we fail to integrate operating systems, networks and management of our acquired companies successfully, we may suffer operating inefficiencies and reduced operating cash flow We may not be able to integrate our acquired companies successfully because we currently operate in 12 different countries with different governmental regulations, languages, customs, currencies and availabilities of telecommunication capacity to carry data. We will have to commit substantial management, operating, financial and other resources to integrate our operating companies and implement our business model, which will reduce our operating cash flow. Because we operate in markets where extended vacations are typical, and since in some of these markets, we receive a portion of our revenues based on customer usage, we may experience seasonal variation in our quarterly revenue and operating results that could cause our stock price to declineIn Europe and Latin America, four or more weeks of vacation is typical and often mandated under law. As a result, extended summer and winter holiday vacations are common and it is difficult to attract new customers during these periods. In these markets, our customers also pay their telephone companies for the number of minutes they spend on-line, even if we provide a local telephone number that they can use for access. We may receive a portion of these fees from the telephone companies as payment for generating usage, and customer usage generally declines in the summer months, July and August in Europe and January and February in Latin America, and in December. As a result, we may experience lower revenues during these periods and our operating results may be affected. To the extent our quarterly results fluctuate more widely than expected by us, securities analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. We face increasing competition for the purchase of local Internet services providers, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitionsOur business strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to identify and acquire new local Internet services providers that meet our acquisition criteria. In pursuing these opportunities, we compete with other Internet services providers, local, regional, national and global telecommunication companies and other buyers. These competitors may drive up the price of our acquisition targets or may acquire our acquisition targets. Many of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than we have. Increasing competition has raised the price we have paid for acquisitions in some markets and may continue to do so. In addition, our acquisition targets may find our competitors more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. 7 Financial information on which we rely to make future acquisitions may not be accurate, which may result in our acquiring undisclosed liabilities or experiencing lower than expected operating resultsThe companies we target for acquisition typically do not have audited financial statements and have varying degrees of internal controls and detailed financial information. As a result, we may acquire undisclosed liabilities or experience lower-than-expected revenues or higher-than-expected costs, which could adversely affect our operating results. To date, no issues of this kind have arisen that have materially adversely affected our results; however, they may arise in the future. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the various currencies in which we conduct business may affect our operating resultsWe record the revenues and expenses of our local operations in their home currencies and translate these amounts into U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues, expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations may adversely affect the comparability of period-to-period results. For example, the value of the Brazilian Real fluctuated by 45.6% in relation to the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and ended the period 37.2% lower than its value to the U.S. dollar in the beginning of the year. Since each Real converted to fewer U.S. dollars, our U.S. dollar revenue was reduced. In the past, the currencies of many Latin American countries, including Brazil and Mexico in particular, have experienced substantial devaluation and volatility. Our Latin American markets have a history of political and economic instability which may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our resultsWe derive and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from the Latin American markets. Latin America has experienced periods of political and economic instability. If these conditions were to reoccur, our business could be adversely affected. Historically, instability in Latin American countries has been caused by . extensive governmental involvement, control or ownership of industries in local economies, including telecommunications facilities, financial institutions and other commerce infrastructure . unexpected changes in regulatory requirements such as imposing licensing requirements or levying new taxes . slow or negative growth as a result of recessionary trends caused by foreign currency devaluations, interest rate hikes and inflation . imposition of trade barriers through trade restrictions, high tariffs and taxes . wage and price controls that reduce potential profitability of businesses Any occurrence of adverse political and economic conditions may deter growth in Internet usage or create uncertainty regarding our operating climate, which my adversely impact our business. Currently, we do not have political risk insurance to guard against business interruptions and other losses caused by political acts. Logistical problems or economic downturns that could result from the introduction of the Euro may affect our ability to operate and adversely impact our operating resultsOn January 1, 1999, 11 of the 15 European Union member countries adopted the Euro as their common legal currency, at which time their respective individual currencies became fixed at a rate of exchange to the Euro, and the Euro became a currency in its own right. During a January 1, 1999 to January 1, 2002 transition period, we must manage transactions with our customers and our third-party vendors who conduct business in Euro participating countries in both the Euro and the individual currencies. If we, our customers or our vendors experience systems problems in converting to the Euro, we could be unable to bill and collect from customers or pay vendors for services, and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. 8The establishment of the European Monetary Union may have a significant effect on the economies of the participant countries. Since a substantial portion of our revenue will be denominated in the Euro or currencies of European Union countries, our operating results could be adversely affected if there is a downturn in the economies of participating countries or if the Euro weakens against other currencies. Our brand names are difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third partiesWe are aware of other companies using or claiming to have rights to use our trademarks and variations of those marks, including the VIA NET.WORKS mark. In particular, one company has notified us that it believes our use of the VIA NET.WORKS mark in Brazil infringes upon its trademark applications. The users of these or similar marks may be found to have senior rights if they were ever to assert a claim against us for trademark infringement. If an infringement suit were instituted against us, even if groundless, it could result in substantial litigation expenses in defending the suit. If such a suit were to be successful, we could be forced to cease using the mark and to pay damagesWe have applied to register several of our trademarks in various countries. Our application to register in Argentina the trademark "VIA Net Works Argentina" has been opposed by a third party. If any of our applications are unsuccessful, we may be required to discontinue the use of those trademarks. Risks Related to our Industry Regulatory and economic conditions of the countries where our operating companies are located are uncertain and may decrease demand for our services, increase our cost of doing business or otherwise reduce our business prospectsOur operating companies are located in countries with rapidly changing regulatory and economic conditions which may affect the Internet services industry. Any new law or regulation pertaining to the Internet or telecommunications, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, could decrease demand for our services, increase our costs or otherwise reduce our profitability or business prospects. Specific examples of the types of laws or regulations that could adversely affect us include laws that . impose taxes on transactions made over the Internet . impose telecommunications access fees on Internet services providers . directly or indirectly affect telecommunications costs generally or the costs of Internet telecommunications specifically . prohibit the transmission over the Internet of various types of information and content . impose requirements on Internet services providers to protect Internet users' privacy or to permit government interception of data traffic . increase the likelihood or scope of competition from telecommunications or cable companiesFor example, some states of Brazil impose a tax of up to 30% on revenues generated by communications services. There has been no judicial determination that Internet access services constitute communications services. If Internet services providers are ultimately required to pay this tax, our Brazilian operations would be negatively and significantly impactedThese laws could require us to incur costs to comply with them or to incur new liability. They could also increase our competition or change our competitive environment so that customer demand for our products and services is affected. For a discussion of specific regulatory proposals that may affect our business, see "Business--Regulatory Matters."In addition to risks we face from new laws or regulations, we face uncertainties in connection with the application of existing laws to the Internet. It may take years to determine the manner in which existing laws 9 governing issues like property ownership, libel, negligence and personal privacy will be applied to communications and commerce over the Internet. Increasing competition for customers in our markets may cause us to reduce our prices or increase spending, which may negatively affect our revenues and operating resultsThere are competitors in our markets with more significant market presence and brand recognition and greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. As a result of this competition, we currently face and expect to continue to face significant pressure to reduce our prices and improve the products and services we offer. Although the competitors we face vary depending on the market and the country, these competitors may include local and regional Internet services providers, telecommunication companies and cable companies. Some of our competitors, especially the telecommunications companies, have large networks in place as well as a significant existing customer base. If demand for Internet services in our markets does not grow as we expect, our ability to grow our revenues will be negatively affectedInternet use in our markets is relatively low. If the market for Internet services fails to develop, or develops more slowly than expected, we may not be able to increase our revenues. Obstacles to the development of Internet services in our markets include: . low rates of personal computer ownership and usage . lack of developed infrastructure to develop Internet access and applications . limited access to Internet servicesIn particular, we depend on increasing demand for Internet services by small to mid-sized businesses in our geographic markets. Demand for Internet services by these businesses will depend partly on the degree to which these businesses' customers and suppliers adopt the Internet as a means of doing business, and partly on the extent to which these businesses adopt Internet technologies to deal with internal business processes, such as internal communications. We are in a rapidly evolving industry in which the products and services we offer, their methods of delivery and their underlying technologies are changing rapidly, and if we do not keep pace with these changes, we may fail to retain and attract customers, which would reduce our revenuesThe Internet services market is characterized by changing customer needs, frequent new service and product introductions, evolving industry standards and rapidly changing technology. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to recognize and respond to these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we fail to do so, we will not be able to compete successfully. We rely on telecommunications companies in our markets to provide our customers with reliable access to our services, and failures or delays in providing access could limit our ability to service our customers and impact our revenues and operating resultsOur customers access our services either through their normal telephone lines or dedicated lines provided by local telecommunications companies specifically for that use. In some of our markets, we experience delays in delivery of new telephone lines that have prevented our customers from accessing our services. These delays result in lost revenues. Additionally, some local telecommunications companies that provide Internet services provide delivery of telephone or dedicated lines to their Internet customers on a preferential basis, which may cause us to lose current and potential customers. We also lease network capacity from telecommunications companies and rely on the quality and availability of their service. These companies may experience disruptions of service which could disrupt our services to, or limit Internet access for, our customers. We may 10 not be able to replace or supplement these services on a timely basis or in a cost-effective manner, which may result in customer dissatisfaction and lost revenues. We depend on the reliability of our network, and a system failure or a breach of our security measures could result in a loss of customers and reduced revenuesWe are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damages from telecommunication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters and unauthorized access. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could impair our ability to provide Internet services to our customers and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers' data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches. Although we currently possess errors and omissions insurance and business interruption insurance, these policies may not provide effective coverage upon the occurrence of all events. We do not have insurance specifically to guard against losses resulting from computer viruses and security breaches. If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or lose the services of our key personnel, our operating results may sufferOur success depends on our key management, engineers, sales and marketing personnel, technical support representatives and other personnel, many of whom may be difficult to replace. If we lose key personnel, we may not be able to find suitable replacements, which may negatively affect our business. In addition, since the demand for qualified personnel in our industry is very high, we may have to increase the salaries and fringe benefits we may offer to our personnel, which may affect our operating results. We do not maintain key person life insurance on, or restrictive employment agreements with, any of our executive officers. We may be liable for information disseminated over our networkWe may face liability for information carried on or disseminated through our network. Some types of laws that may result in our liability for information disseminated over our network include: . laws designed to protect intellectual property, including trademark and copyright laws . laws relating to publicity and privacy rights and laws prohibiting defamation . laws restricting the collection, use and processing of personal data and . laws prohibiting the sale, dissemination or possession of pornographic materialThe laws governing these matters vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For information about the applicable laws that may affect our liability for information carried or disseminated through our network, see "Business-- Regulatory Matters." The availability of protection for intellectual property rights in the context of the Internet remains uncertain We rely on trademark and copyright law, laws restricting unfair trade practices, laws relating to trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. The applicability and enforceability of legal principles concerning intellectual property rights in an Internet context remains substantially uncertain as the courts and legislatures in each country in which we operate continue to address the issues. Substantially all of the countries in which we operate are signatories to the same international treaties relating to the protection of intellectual property to which the United States adheres. Nonetheless, in many of these countries, the courts have not had the opportunity to address the legal issues within the Internet context to the same degree as U.S. courts. It is therefore uncertain whether the intellectual property of our non-U.S. operations will be subject to a lesser or different degree of protection than that generally afforded in the United States. 11 The Year 2000 issue could impair our ability to provide services to our customers, increase our costs, or reduce our revenues or profitabilityYear 2000 issues may adversely affect our business and our customers' businesses. Many computer systems may fail or malfunction because they are unable to distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates. We have incurred costs to upgrade our computers to address the year 2000 issue and may in the future incur additional costs. Our customers may also need to incur costs to either upgrade their computers or correct any problems their computers may encounter, which may reduce our revenues by diverting our customers' information systems resources away from our products and services. In addition, if our computer systems or those of our telecommunications suppliers fail or malfunction as a result of Year 2000 issues, our ability to provide services to our customers will be disrupted, which could result in lost revenues, lost customers or claims for damages, which could lead to costly litigation. For information on how we are addressing year 2000 issues, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure." Risks Related to this Offering We have discretion over the use of all of the net proceeds from this offering and may fail to use them effectively to grow our businessWe will retain discretion over how to use the net proceeds of this offering. Because the proceeds are not required to be allocated to any specific investment or transaction, you will not be able to determine at this time the value or appropriateness of our use of the proceeds. You will pay a higher price for our common stock than was paid by existing stockholders and will experience immediate and substantial dilutionIf you purchase common stock in this offering, you will pay more for your shares than the amounts paid by existing stockholders for their shares. As a result, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $14.54 per share, and our existing stockholders will experience an unrealized gain of $195.6 million in the aggregate. 42,068,821, or 73.7%, of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future. These sales could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing wellAfter this offering, we will have outstanding 57,068,821 shares of common stock, based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on January 14, 2000. This amount includes the 15,000,000 shares we are selling in this offering, which may be resold in the public market immediately. The remaining 73.7%, or 42,068,821 shares, of our total outstanding shares will become available for resale in the public market, subject to restrictions under federal securities laws, as shown in the chart below. For information regarding these restrictions, see "Shares Eligible for Future Sale."As restrictions on resale end, the market price could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. &lt;TABLE&gt; &lt;CAPTION&gt; Number of shares/ % of total outstanding Date of availability for resale into public market ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------- &lt;S&gt; &lt;C&gt; 41,613,184/ 180 days after the date of this prospectus due to an 72.9% agreement these stockholders have agreed to deliver to the underwriters. However, the underwriters can waive this restriction and allow these stockholders to sell their shares at any time. 455,637/ Between 90 and 365 days after the date of this 0.8% prospectus due to the requirements of the federal securities laws. &lt;/TABLE&gt; 12In addition, holders of approximately 41,340,721 shares of common stock and non-voting common stock will be entitled to registration rights with respect to their common stock. If these holders exercise their registration rights, causing a large number of shares to be sold in the public market, our market price may drop significantly. Our stock has not traded publicly and may not trade actively after this offeringPrior to this offering, you could not buy or sell our common stock publicly. We cannot assure you that an active public trading market for our stock will develop or be sustained after this offering. The market price of our common stock, like the market prices of stocks of other Internet-related and technology companies, may fluctuate widely and rapidlyThe securities of many companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, often unrelated to the companies' operating performance. Specifically, market prices for securities of Internet-related and technology companies have frequently reached elevated levels following their initial public offerings. These levels may be unsustainable and may not bear any relationship to these companies' operating performances. If the market price of our common stock reaches an elevated level following this offering, it may materially and rapidly decline. Fluctuations in our common stock's market price may affect our visibility and credibility in the Internet services provider marketIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company. If we were to become involved in a class action suit, it could be costly and divert the attention of management. Furthermore, if adversely determined, a class action suit may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The price per share of our common stock in this offering may not be indicative of the market price that will prevail after this offeringSince our stock has not yet traded publicly, our management and the underwriters will negotiate the common stock's initial public offering price per share. The price they determine may not be indicative of the market price that will prevail after this offering. For example, the market price of our common stock after this offering could vary from the initial public offering price in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond our control: . changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts . future announcements concerning us or our competitors of key personnel changes, significant contracts, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, technological innovations or capital commitments . additions or departures of key personnel . quarterly fluctuations in operating results . fluctuations in the stock price and volume of traded shares, especially in the traditionally volatile Internet-related and technology sectors 13</td>

      <td>risk factors an investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. prior to investing in our ordinary shares, we encourage each prospective investor to carefully read this entire prospectus, including, without limitation, the following risk factors and the section of this prospectus entitled cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements. any of the following factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. if any of these risks occur, the value of our ordinary shares could decline, and you could lose all or part of your original investment. risks related to our business the accessories, footwear and apparel industries are heavily influenced by general macroeconomic cycles that affect consumer spending, and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits. purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. the success of our operations depends on a number of factors impacting discretionary consumer spending, including general economic conditions, consumer confidence, wages and unemployment, housing prices, consumer debt, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, taxation and political conditions. a continuation or worsening of the current weakness in the economy may negatively affect consumer and wholesale purchases of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we may not be able to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and operating results. the accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. we believe that our success is largely dependent on our brand image and ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design, styling, production, merchandising and pricing of products. if we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately, consumers may not purchase our products and our brand name and brand image may be impaired. even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brand image to be outdated or associate our brand with styles that are no longer popular or trend-setting. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and operating results.the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within north america and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline. we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign accessories, footwear and apparel producers and retailers, including, among others, coach, burberry, ralph lauren, herms, louis vuitton, gucci, marc jacobs, chlo and prada. competition is based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, the following: anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner; establishing and maintaining favorable brand-name recognition; determining and maintaining product quality; maintaining key employees; 11 maintaining and growing market share; developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers; establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with retail customers; pricing products appropriately; providing appropriate service and support to retailers; optimizing retail and supply chain capabilities; determining size and location of retail and department store selling space; and protecting intellectual property. in addition, some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories, footwear and apparel industries, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products. the general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. competition, along with such other factors as consolidation and changes in consumer spending patterns, could also result in significant pricing pressure. these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers, which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.the departure of our founder, members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. we depend on the services and management experience of our founder and executive officers, who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. in particular, mr.kors, our honorary chairman and chief creative officer, has provided design and executive leadership to the company since its inception. he is instrumental to our marketing and publicity strategy and is closely identified with both the brand that bears his name and our company in general. our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr.kors name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. mr.kors has the right to terminate his employment with us without cause. in addition, the leadership of john d. idol, our chairman and chief executive officer, and joseph b. parsons, our executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief operating officer, has been a critical element of our success. we also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing, design and advertising operations. competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense, and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our executive officers and key employees. although we have entered into employment agreements with mr.kors and certain of our other executive officers, including mr.idol and mr.parsons, we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future. the loss of services of one or more of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to, or relating to, the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to open and operate new retail stores and increase the number of department stores and specialty stores that sell our products. as part of our growth strategy, we intend to open and operate new retail stores and shop-in-shops within select department stores, both domestically and internationally. our ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to: identify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops will be considered successful; negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances, to secure suitable store locations; hire, train and retain personnel and field management; assimilate new personnel and field management into our corporate culture; source sufficient inventory levels; and successfully integrate new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops into our existing operations and information technology systems. we will encounter pre-operating costs and we may encounter initial losses when new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops commence operations. while we expect to open a number of additional retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops in fiscal 2012, there can be no assurance that we will open the planned number, that we will recover the expenditure costs associated with opening these new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops or that the operation of these new venues will be successful or profitable. any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. we face additional risks with respect to our strategy to expand internationally, including our efforts to further expand our operations in european countries and in japan as well as other asian countries. in some of these countries we do not yet have significant operating experience, and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations. many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including, but not limited to, employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate (including lease terms) and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and, as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. in addition, in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we have grown rapidly in recent years and we have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations; if we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our brand image and financial performance may suffer. we have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating experience at our current size. our total revenue increased from $397.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $803.3 million in fiscal 2011. if our operations continue to grow, we will be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarter personnel. our continued growth could strain our existing resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, difficulties in hiring, training and managing an 13 increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products and delays in production and shipments. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.as we expand our store base, we may be unable to maintain the same comparable store sales or average sales per square foot that we have in the past, which could cause our share price to decline. as we expand our store base, we may not be able to maintain the levels of comparable store sales that we have experienced historically. in addition, we may not be able to maintain our historic average sales per square foot as we move into new markets. if our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations, the price of our ordinary shares could decline. in addition, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. a variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot, including, among others, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. if we misjudge the market for our products, we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. these factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods and our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our ordinary shares.we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space under long-term, non-cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases; any failure to make these lease payments when due could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. we do not own any of our store facilities; instead, we lease all of our stores under operating leases. our leases generally have terms of 10 years with no renewal options. our leases generally require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs. for example, as of october 1, 2011, we were party to operating leases associated with our stores as well as other corporate facilities requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating $248.1million through fiscal 2016 and approximately $234.1 million thereafter through fiscal 2028. we expect that we will also lease any new stores we open under operating leases with terms similar to those contained in leases we have entered previously, which will further increase our operating lease expenses. our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including, among others: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; requiring a substantial portion of our available cash to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes; limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and placing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors. we depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us, we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs. our current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control. we have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell, under our trademarks, products requiring specialized expertise. we have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas, including, among others, korea, the philippines, singapore, malaysia, the middle east and turkey. our operations in china, hong kong, macau and taiwan are conducted pursuant to similar licensing agreements that we have entered into with entities that are indirectly owned by certain of our current shareholders, including mr.kors, mr.idol and sportswear holdings limited. see certain relationships and related party transactionsmichael kors far east holdings limited. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners, such arrangements may not be successful. our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the timing of new store openings, the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. in addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partners ability to: obtain capital; exercise operational and financial control over its business; manage its labor relations; maintain relationships with suppliers; manage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and maintain customer relationships. any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands. although we attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over store location and design, product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our stores and products, we may not be able to control the use by our licensing partners of each of our licensed brands. the misuse of our brands by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers, and the loss of any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenue. a small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales. net sales to our five largest wholesale customers were 30.4% of our total revenue for fiscal 2011 and 35.7% of our total revenue for fiscal 2010. our largest wholesale customer, a large, nationally recognized u.s. department store, accounted for 13.8% of our total revenue for fiscal 2011 and 14.5% of our total revenue for fiscal 2010. we do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale customers, and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. a decision by any of our major wholesale customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. during the past several years, the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes, and we expect such changes will continue. in addition, store closings by our wholesale customers decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a 15 smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. in the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores target markets. any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. these changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.a material disruption in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely extensively on our information technology (it) systems to track inventory, manage our supply chain, record and process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. the failure of our it systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or difficulty in integrating new systems could adversely affect our business. in addition, our it systems may be subject to damage and/or interruption from power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and usage errors by our employees. if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim. any significant disruption in our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.direct privacy breaches and the engagement of third parties to operate our e-commerce business could negatively affect our reputation, credibility and business. we are responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce website, michaelkors.com, and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. consumers are increasingly concerned over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. in addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our customers identity and privacy. we do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future. any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers. finally, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information, to the extent they are applicable.increases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer. the costs of raw materials used in our products are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. we are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials, and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials. the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain, but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. if one or more of our distribution facilities becomes inoperable, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. we operate a limited number of distribution facilities. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities. if any of these distribution 16 facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our customers and retail stores. in addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged facility. in addition, we currently operate our california distribution from three separate warehouses totaling approximately 350,000 square feet. the leases for these three facilities expire on march31, 2012. we have executed a lease for an approximately 500,000 square foot distribution center in whittier, california, which we believe will allow us to significantly increase our distribution capabilities and efficiency. we took possession of the new distribution center in october 2011 and intend to complete our transition into this facility prior to the march31, 2012 expiration of the leases for our existing california distribution facilities. as part of this transition, we will implement a new warehouse management system that will supplement our current legacy system and further support our efforts to operate with increased efficiency and flexibility. there are risks inherent in transitioning our existing three distribution facilities into one new facility and in implementing a new warehouse management system, including the risk of late delivery of possession of the new facility, difficulty in negotiating acceptable terms to remain temporarily in the existing facilities in the event of any such late delivery and other operational difficulties that may arise in commencing operations in a new facility with a new management system. any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations. our products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors located mainly in countries in asia, europe and central and south america. a manufacturing contractors failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. the failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any of the following factors could negatively affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results: political or labor instability, labor shortages or increases in costs of labor or production in countries where manufacturing contractors and suppliers are located; political or military conflict involving the united states, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials and increase transportation costs; heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods of time or could result in increased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands; a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials; disease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas; the migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced; imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust in a timely manner to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed; increases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; 17 significant fluctuation of the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies; and restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located. we do not have written agreements with any of our third-party manufacturing contractors. as a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. in fiscal 2011, our largest manufacturing contractor, who primarily produces its products in china and who we have worked with for the last seven years, accounted for the production of 30.5% of our finished products. our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, we use third-party agents to source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf. we do not have written agreements with any of our agents. as a result, any single agent could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. in fiscal 2011, our largest third-party agent, whose primary place of business is hong kong and who we have worked with for the last seven years, sourced approximately 19.5% of our purchases of finished goods. our inability to promptly replace agents that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality service in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.if our manufacturing contractors fail to use acceptable, ethical business practices, our business and reputation could suffer. we require our manufacturing contractors to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those three areas in order to promote ethical business practices, and our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our manufacturing contractors to determine compliance. however, we do not control our manufacturing contractors or their labor and other business practices. if one of our manufacturing contractors violates applicable labor or other laws, rules or regulations or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. we have a $100.0 million
