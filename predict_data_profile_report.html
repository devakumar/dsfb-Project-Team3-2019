    <th>risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this prospectus, before deciding to invest in our common stock. risks related to our business general business and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. our businesses and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the united states. if the u.s.economy is unable to steadily emerge from the recession that began in 2007 or we experience worsening economic conditions, such as a so-called double-dip recession, our growth and profitability could be constrained. in addition, economic conditions in foreign countries can affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder the u.s.economic recovery. financial markets remain concerned about the ability of certain european countries, particularly greece, ireland, portugal, spain and italy, to finance and service their debt. the default by any one of these countries on their debt payments could lead to weaker economic conditions in the united states. weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, including a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. all of these factors are detrimental to our business. our business is significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the u.s.federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities, or gses. changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition. liquidity is essential to our business. actions by the federal home loan bank of atlanta, or fhlb, or the frb may reduce our borrowing capacity. additionally, we may not be able to attract deposits at competitive rates. an inability to raise funds through traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity or result in increased funding costs. furthermore, we invest in several asset classes, including significant investments in mortgage servicing rights, or msr, which may be less liquid in certain markets. liquidity may also be adversely impacted by bank supervisory and regulatory authorities mandating changes in the composition of our balance sheet to asset classes that are less liquid. our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. in addition, our access to deposits may be affected by the liquidity and/or cash flow needs of depositors. although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and fhlb advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future and can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds and increase our funding costs if, among other things, customers move funds out of bank deposits and into alternative investments, such as the stock market, that are perceived as providing superior expected returns. furthermore, an inability to increase our deposit base at all or at attractive rates would impede our ability to fund our continued growth, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 17 our ability to raise funds through deposits or borrowings could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets. although we consider our sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs, we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future. we may be required to seek additional regulatory capital through capital raising at terms that may be very dilutive to existing stockholders. likewise, we may need to incur additional debt in the future to achieve our business objectives, in connection with future acquisitions or for other reasons. any borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on favorable terms.our financial results are significantly affected in a number of ways by changes in interest rates, which may make our results volatile and difficult to predict from quarter to quarter. most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, which subjects us to significant risks from changes in interest rates and can impact our net income and the valuation of our assets and liabilities. our operating results depend to a great extent on our net interest margin, which is the difference between the amount of interest income we earn and the amount of interest expense we incur. if the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing deposits, borrowings and other liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, would be adversely affected. our earnings also could be adversely affected if the rates on our loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits and other liabilities. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the frb. a strengthening u.s.economy would be expected to cause the frb to increase short-term interest rates, which would increase our borrowing costs and may reduce our profit margins. a sustained low interest rate environment could cause many of our loans subject to adjustable rates to reprice downward to lower interest rates, which would decrease our loan yields and reduce our profit margins. changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on our mortgage loan origination revenues. historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the demand for mortgage loans and interest rates. mortgage origination volume and revenues usually decline during periods of rising or high interest rates and increase during periods of declining or low interest rates. changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of a significant percentage of the assets on our balance sheet. furthermore, our msr are valued based on a number of factors, including assumptions about borrower repayment rates, which are heavily influenced by prevailing interest rates. when interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. as the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our msr can decrease, which, in turn, may reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. we recorded a $39.5million impairment charge related to msr for the year ended december31, 2011. in addition, mortgage loans held for sale for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist and other interests we hold related to residential loan sales and securitizations are carried at fair value. the value of these assets may be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. we may not correctly or adequately hedge this risk, and even if we do hedge the risk with derivatives and other instruments, we may still incur significant losses from changes in the value of these assets or from changes in the value of the hedging instruments. even though originating mortgage loans, which benefit from declining rates, and servicing mortgage loans, which benefit from rising rates, can act as a natural hedge to soften the overall impact of changes in rates on our consolidated financial results, the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. for example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of 18 residential msr is generally immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the msr relating to the new loans would generally accrue over time. in addition, in recent quarters it has become apparent that even a low interest rate environment may not result in a significant increase in mortgage originations in light of other macroeconomic variable factors, declining real estate values and changes in underwriting standards resulting from the recent recession. we enter into forward starting swaps as a hedging strategy related to our expected future issuances of debt. this hedging strategy allows us to fix the interest rate margin between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities. a continued prolonged period of lower interest rates could affect the duration of our interest earning assets and adversely impact our operations in future periods.we may be required to make further increases in our provisions for loan and lease losses and to charge-off additional loans and leases in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations. the real estate market in the united states since late 2007 has been characterized by high delinquency rates and price deterioration. despite historically low interest rates beginning in 2008, higher credit standards, weak employment, slow economic growth and an overall de-leveraging in the residential and commercial sectors have perpetuated these trends. we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease loss expense that represents managements best estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. the level of the allowance reflects managements judgment with respect to: continuing evaluation of specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan and lease portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; industry concentrations;and other unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. if current trends in the real estate markets continue, we expect that we will continue to experience increased delinquencies and credit losses, particularly with respect to construction, land development and land loans. in addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses, which would result in a decrease in net income and capital, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.mortgage loan modification and refinancing programs and future legislative action may adversely affect the value of, and our returns on, residential mortgage-backed securities and on msr. the u.s.government, through the frb, the fha and the fdic, has initiated a number of loss mitigation programs designed to afford relief to homeowners facing foreclosure and to assist borrowers whose home value is less than the principal on their mortgage, including the home 19 affordable modification program, or hamp, which provides homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures, the hope for homeowners program, or h4h program, which allows certain distressed borrowers to refinance their mortgages into federal housing administration, or fha, insured loans in order to avoid residential mortgage loan foreclosures, and the home affordable refinancing program, or harp, which make it easier for borrowers to refinance at lower interest rates. these loan modification programs, future legislative or regulatory actions, including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws, which result in the modification of outstanding residential mortgage loans, as well as changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing mortgage loans with fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, or mbs, and on the value of our msr. our msr is valued based on a number of factors, including assumptions about borrower repayment rates and costs of servicing. if the interest rate on a mortgage is adjusted, or if a borrower is permitted to refinance at a lower rate, or the costs of servicing or costs of foreclosures increase, the value of our msr with respect to that mortgage can decrease, which, in turn, may reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. in addition, increases in our servicing costs from changes to our foreclosure and other servicing practices, including resulting from the consent orders, adversely affects the fair value of our msr.our commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to risks that may be greater than the risks related to our other mortgage loans and a high percentage of these loans are secured by properties located in florida. many analysts and economists are predicting that commercial mortgage loans could continue to see further deterioration. at december31, 2011, our commercial real estate loans, net of discounts, were $1.0billion, or approximately 11% of our total loan portfolio, net of allowances. commercial real estate loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than residential mortgage loans or home equity loans. the repayment of these loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate or commercial projects. if the cash flow from the project is reduced, a borrowers ability to repay the loan may be impaired. furthermore, the repayment of commercial mortgage loans is generally less predictable and more difficult to evaluate and monitor and collateral may be more difficult to dispose of in a market decline. in such cases, we may be compelled to modify the terms of the loan or engage in other potentially expensive work-out techniques. any significant failure to pay on time by our customers would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. as a result of our 2010 acquisition of the banking operations of bank of florida in an fdic-assisted transaction, we have increased our exposure to risks related to economic conditions in florida. unlike our residential mortgage loan portfolio, which is more geographically diverse, approximately 81% of our commercial loans as of december31, 2011, are secured by properties located in florida. florida has experienced a deeper recession and more dramatic slowdown in economic activity than other states and the decline in real estate values in florida has been significantly higher than the national average. our concentration of commercial loans in this region subjects us to risk that a further downturn in the local economy could result in increases in delinquencies and foreclosures or losses on these loans. in addition, the occurrence of natural disasters in florida, such as hurricanes, or man-made disasters, such as the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico, could result in a decline in the value or destruction of our mortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies or foreclosures. losses we may experience on loans acquired from bank of florida may be covered by loss sharing agreements we entered into with the fdic in connection with the acquisition. see business recent acquisitions acquisition of bank of florida. nevertheless, these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. conditions in the real estate market and higher than normal delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our business. the origination and servicing of residential mortgages is a significant component of our business and our earnings have been and may continue to be adversely affected by weak real estate markets and historically high delinquency and default rates. mortgage origination volume has been low in recent fiscal periods compared to historical levels (and refinancing activity in particular) and may remain low for the foreseeable future even if economic trends improve, particularly if interest rates significantly rise and more restrictive underwriting standards persist. at december31, 2011, our msr assets decreased by approximately 15%, from december31, 2010 with msr at the end of such period representing 4% of total assets and 43% of our tier1 capital plus the general allowance for loan and lease losses. if the frequency and severity of our loan delinquencies and default rates increase, we could experience losses on loans held for investment and on newly originated or purchased loans that we hold for sale. during 2009, we experienced an increase in foreclosures and reserves due to an increase in loss severity and foreclosure frequency resulting primarily from a decline in housing prices during 2008 and 2009. we may need to further increase our reserves for foreclosures if foreclosure rates return to the levels experienced in these recent periods. continued or worsening conditions in the real estate market and higher than normal delinquency and default rates on loans have other adverse consequences for our mortgage banking business, including: cash flows and capital resources are reduced, as we are required to make cash advances to meet contractual obligations to investors, process foreclosures, maintain, repair and market foreclosed properties; mortgage service fee revenues decline because we recognize these revenues only upon collection; net interest income may decline and interest expense may increase due to lower average cash and capital balances and higher capital funding requirements; mortgage and loan servicing costs rise; an inability to sell our msr in the capital markets due to reduced liquidity; amortization and impairment charges on our msr increase;and realized and unrealized losses on and declines in the liquidity of securities held in our investment portfolio that are collateralized by mortgage obligations.we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans with identified defects, indemnify the investor or guarantor, or reimburse the investor for credit loss incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of representations or warranties. we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse investors as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties, from our sales of loans we originate and servicing of loans originated by other parties. we conduct these activities under contractual provisions that include various representations and warranties which typically cover ownership of the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, validity of the lien securing the loan and similar matters. we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans with identified defects, indemnify the investor or guarantor, or reimburse the investor for credit loss incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of such contractual representations or warranties. we experienced increased levels of repurchase demands in 2010 and further increased levels in 2011 as compared to prior periods, which has led to material increases in our loan repurchase reserves and we may need to increase such reserves in the future, which would adversely affect net 21 income. as of december 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 our loan repurchase reserve for loans that we sold or securitized was $3.6 million, $26.8 million and $32.0 million, respectively. in addition, we also service residential mortgage loans where a gse is the owner of the underlying mortgage loan asset. prior to late 2009, we had not historically experienced a significant amount of repurchases related to the servicing of mortgage loans as we were indemnified by the seller of the servicing rights but due to the failures of several of our counterparties, in 2010 and 2011 we have experienced losses related to the repurchase of loans from gses and subsequent disposal or payment demands from the gses. as of december 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 our reserve for servicing repurchase losses was $6.3 million, $30.0 million and $30.4 million, respectively. if future repurchase demands remain at these heightened levels or increase further or the severity of the repurchase requests increases, or our success at appealing repurchase or other requests differs from past experience, we may need to further increase our loan repurchase reserves, and increased repurchase obligations could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. for additional information, see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loans subject to representations and warranties.our concentration of mass-affluent customers and so-called jumbo mortgages in our residential mortgage portfolio makes us particularly vulnerable to a downturn in high-end real estate values and economic factors disproportionately affecting affluent consumers of financial services. the federal housing administration, fannie mae and freddie mac will only purchase or guarantee so-called conforming loans, which may not exceed certain principal amount thresholds. as of december31, 2011, approximately 61% of our residential mortgage loans held for investment was comprised of so-called jumbo loans based on the current threshold of $417,000 in most states, and 91% of the carrying value of our securities portfolio was comprised of residential nonagency investment securities, substantially all of which are backed by jumbo loans. jumbo loans have principal balances exceeding the thresholds of the agencies described above, and tend to be less liquid than conforming loans, which may make it more difficult for us to rapidly rebalance our portfolio and risk profile than is the case for financial institutions with higher concentrations of conforming loan assets. due to macroeconomic conditions, jumbo mortgage loans have, in recent periods, experienced increased rates of delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss, and they are likely to continue to experience delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss rates that are higher, and that may be substantially higher, than conforming mortgage loans. in such event, liquidity in the capital markets for such assets could be diminished and we could be faced with increased losses and an inability to dispose of such assets.hedging strategies that we use to manage our mortgage pipeline may be ineffective to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. we typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge a portion of our mortgage banking interest rate risk. hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. we may use hedging instruments tied to u.s.treasury rates, london interbank offered rate, or libor, or eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. our mortgage pipeline consists of our commitments to purchase mortgage loans, or interest rate locks, and funded mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary market. the risk associated with the mortgage pipeline is that interest rates will fluctuate between the time we commit to purchase a loan at a pre-determined price, or the customer locks in the interest rate on a loan, and the time we sell or commit to sell the mortgage loan. generally speaking, if interest rates increase, the value of an unhedged mortgage pipeline decreases, and gain on sale margins are adversely impacted. typically, we hedge the risk of overall changes in fair value of loans held for sale by either entering into forward loan sale agreements, selling forward fannie mae or freddie mac mbs or using other derivative instruments to hedge loan commitments and to create fair 22 value hedges against the funded loan portfolios. we generally do not hedge all of the interest rate risk on our mortgage portfolio and have not historically hedged the risk of changes in the fair value of our msr resulting from changes in interest rates. to the extent we fail to appropriately reduce our exposure to interest rate changes, our financial results may be adversely affected.we could recognize realized and unrealized losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if economic and market conditions deteriorate. as of december31, 2011, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $2.1billion, of which approximately 90% was comprised of residential nonagency investment securities. factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. these factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the credit markets. any of these factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. the process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.we may experience higher delinquencies on our equipment leases and reductions in the resale value of leased equipment. in connection with the acquisition of tygris, we acquired a significant portfolio of equipment leases. although we purchased these leases at a discount, they were not subjected to our credit standards. the non-impaired leases we acquired may become impaired and the impaired leases may suffer further deterioration in value, resulting in additional charge-offs to this portfolio. fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions may increase the level of charge-offs that we make to our lease portfolio, and, consequently, reduce our net income. although a significant portion of these losses will be satisfied out of escrowed portions of the purchase price paid by us, we are not protected for all losses and any charge-off of related losses that we experience will negatively impact our results of operations. the realization of equipment values (i.e., residual values) during the life and at the end of the term of a lease is an important element of our commercial finance business. at the inception of each lease, we record a residual value for the leased equipment based on our estimate of the future value of the equipment at the expected disposition date. a decrease in the market value of leased equipment at a rate greater than the rate we projected, whether due to rapid technological or economic obsolescence, unusual or excessive wear-and-tear on the equipment, recession or other adverse economic conditions, or other factors, would adversely affect the current or the residual values of such equipment. further, certain equipment residual values are dependent on the manufacturers or vendors warranties, reputation and other factors, including market liquidity. in addition, we may not realize the full market value of equipment if we are required to sell it to meet liquidity needs or for other reasons outside of the ordinary course of business. consequently, we may not realize our estimated residual values for equipment. if we are unable to realize the expected value of a substantial portion of the equipment under lease, our business could be adversely affected.we may become subject to a number of risks if we elect to pursue acquisitions and may not be able to acquire and integrate acquisition targets successfully if we choose to do so. as we have done in the past, we may pursue acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. we may consider acquisitions of loans or securities portfolios, lending or leasing firms, commercial and 23 small business lenders, residential lenders, direct banks, banks or bank branches (whether in fdic-assisted or unassisted transactions), wealth and investment management firms, securities brokerage firms, specialty finance or other financial services-related companies. we expect that competition for suitable acquisition targets may be significant. additionally, we must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire an institution or business. such regulatory approval may be denied or, if granted, could be subject to conditions that materially affect the terms of the acquisition or our ability to capture some of the opportunities presented by the acquisition. we may not be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on terms and conditions we consider to be acceptable. even if suitable candidates are identified and we succeed in consummating these transactions, acquisitions involve risks that may adversely affect our market value and profitability. these risks include, among other things: credit risk associated with acquired loans and investments; retaining, attracting and integrating personnel; loss of customers; reputational risks; difficulties in integrating or operating acquired businesses or assets; and potential disruption of our ongoing business operations and diversion of managements attention. through our acquisitions we may also assume unknown or undisclosed liabilities, fail to properly assess known contingent liabilities or assume businesses with internal control deficiencies. while in most of our transactions we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, adequate due diligence and indemnification provisions, we cannot be certain that the due diligence we have conducted is adequate or that the indemnification provisions and other risk mitigants we put in place will be sufficient. in addition, fdic-assisted acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks even though the fdic might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing in the exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of a failed institution. however, because these acquisitions are typically conducted by the fdic in a manner that does not allow the time normally associated with preparing for the integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks in fdic-assisted transactions. these risks include, among other things, the loss of customers, strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems. we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly during periods in wh</th>

    <th>risk factors before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus. we believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this prospectus. if any of the following risks comes to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. in these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our business and industrywe have a history of net losses and may never become profitable. we have incurred net losses from our inception through december31, 2007, including net losses of $11.5million for the year ended december31, 2005, $7.6million for the year ended december31, 2006 and $0.4million for the year ended december31, 2007. even giving effect to the pdsheart acquisition, we are operating at a loss, with pro forma losses for the year ended december31, 2007, giving effect to the acquisition, of $0.3million. as of december31, 2007, we had total shareholders' deficit of approximately $26.9million. we expect our operating expenses to increase as we, among other things: expand our sales and marketing activities; invest in designing, manufacturing and building our inventory of future generations of the cardionet system; hire additional personnel; invest in infrastructure; and incur the additional expenses associated with being a public company. with increasing expenses, we will need to substantially increase our revenues to become profitable. because of the risks and uncertainties associated with further developing and marketing the cardionet system, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.our business is dependent upon physicians prescribing our services; if we fail to obtain those prescriptions, our revenues could fail to grow and could decrease. the success of our business is dependent upon physicians prescribing our services for patients and cross-selling the respective cardionet and pdsheart customer bases. our success in obtaining prescriptions and cross-selling will be directly influenced by a number of factors, including: the ability of the physicians with whom we work to obtain sufficient reimbursement and be paid in a timely manner for the professional services they provide in connection with the use of our arrhythmia monitoring solutions, particularly the cardionet system; our ability to educate physicians regarding, and convince them of, the benefits of the cardionet system over existing treatment methods such as holter monitors and event monitors; and the perceived clinical efficacy of the cardionet system. if we are unable to educate physicians regarding the benefits of the cardionet system, obtain sufficient prescriptions and cross-sell our respective customer bases, revenues from the provision of our arrhythmia monitoring solutions could fail to grow and could decrease. we and the physicians with whom we work are dependent upon reimbursement for the fees associated with our services; the absence or inadequacy of reimbursement would cause our revenues to fail to grow or decrease. we receive reimbursement for our services from commercial payors and from medicare partb carriers where the services are performed on behalf of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, or cms. the medicare partb carriers in each state change from time to time, which may result in changes to our reimbursement rates, increased administrative burden and reimbursement delays. in addition, our prescribing physicians receive reimbursement for professional interpretation of the information provided by our products and services from commercial payors or medicare carriers within the state where they practice. the efficacy, safety, performance and cost-effectiveness of our products and services, on a stand-alone basis and relative to competing services, will determine the availability and level of reimbursement we and our prescribing physicians receive. our ability to successfully contract with payors is critical to our business because physicians and their patients will select arrhythmia monitoring solutions other than ours in the event that payors refuse to adequately reimburse our technical fees and physicians' professional fees. many commercial payors refuse to enter into contracts to reimburse the fees associated with medical devices or services that such payors determine to be "experimental and investigational." commercial payors typically label medical devices or services as "experimental and investigational" until such devices or services have demonstrated product superiority evidenced by a randomized clinical trial. we completed a clinical trial in which the cardionet system provided higher diagnostic yield than traditional loop event monitoring. prior to our clinical trial, the cardionet system was labeled "experimental and investigational" by 21 targeted commercial payors, representing approximately 95million covered lives. subsequent to our trial, three commercial payors, representing over 26million covered lives, removed the designation of the cardionet system as "experimental and investigational." several of the remaining payors, however, have informed us that they do not believe the data from this trial justifies the removal of this designation. other commercial payors may also find the data from our clinical trial not compelling. additional commercial payors may also label the cardionet system as "experimental and investigational" and, as a result, refuse to reimburse the technical and professional fees associated with the cardionet system. administration of the claims process for the many commercial payors is complex. as a result we sometimes bill payors for services for which we have no reimbursement contract. these payors may require that we return any funds that they pay in respect of these claims. if commercial payors or medicare decide not to reimburse our services or the related services provided by physicians, or the rates of such reimbursement change, or if we fail to properly administer claims, our revenues could fail to grow and could decrease.reimbursement by medicare is highly regulated and subject to change; our failure to comply with applicable regulations, could decrease our revenues and may subject us to penalties or have an adverse impact on our business. we receive approximately 30% of our revenues as reimbursement from medicare. the medicare program is administered by centers for medicare &medicaid services, or cms, which imposes extensive and detailed requirements on medical services providers, including, but not limited to, rules that govern how we structure our relationships with physicians, how and when we submit reimbursement claims, how we operate our monitoring facilities and how and where we provide our arrhythmia monitoring solutions. our failure to comply with applicable medicare rules could result in discontinuing our reimbursement under the medicare payment program, our being required to return funds already paid to us, civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare program. in addition, reimbursement from medicare is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, local and national coverage decisions, rate adjustments and administrative rulings, all of which could materially affect the range of services covered or the reimbursement rates paid by medicare for use of our arrhythmia monitoring solutions. for example, cms adopted a new payment policy in january2007 that reduced the rate of reimbursement for a number of services reimbursed by medicare. although this modification to medicare's reimbursement rates did not affect the amount paid by medicare for reimbursement of the fees associated with the cardionet system, it resulted in the reduction of reimbursement rates for event services by 3% to 8%, depending on the type of service, and holter services by 8% as compared to the corresponding rates in effect in 2006. based on current proposed medicare rates for 2008 through 2010, we expect that reimbursement for event and holter services will continue to decline at an annual rate similar to 2007. in addition, we cannot predict whether future modifications to medicare's reimbursement policies could reduce or eliminate the amounts we receive from medicare for the solutions we provide. in addition, medicare's reimbursement rates can affect the rate that commercial payors are willing to pay for our products and services. consequently, any future elimination, limitation or reduction in the reimbursement rates provided by medicare for our arrhythmia monitoring solutions could result in a reduction in the rates we receive from commercial payors.reimbursement for the cardionet system by medicare and other commercial payors is complicated by the lack of a specific current procedural terminology, or cpt, code, which may result in lower prescription rates or varying reimbursement rates. when we bill medicare and certain other commercial payors for the service we provide in connection with the cardionet system, we submit the bill using the nonspecific billing, or cpt, code "93799." unlike dedicated cpt codes approved by the american medical association, or ama, and cms, claims using non-specific codes may require semi-automated or manual processing, as well as additional review by payors. the claims processing requirements associated with a nonspecific code can make our services less attractive to physicians because added time and effort is often required in order to receive payment for their services. furthermore, the medicare reimbursement rate for non-specific codes is determined by local medicare carriers. as a result, the reimbursement rates relating to our cardionet system are subject to change without notice. a request to the ama for a specific cpt code that describes our cardionet system has been made. the request was discussed and voted upon by the cpt editorial panel at its public october 2007 meeting. the results of the vote are confidential. we have been informally advised that the cpt editorial panel voted in favor of the request. however, the results of the vote are subject to change until such results are published in the fall of 2008. if the request is officially approved by the ama cpt editorial panel, the specific cpt code would be published in the fall of 2008 and would be available for use in 2009. however, we cannot guarantee that we will receive a specific cpt code for the cardionet system in that timeframe, or ever. moreover, if we do receive a cpt code, the reimbursement rate associated with that code, which would be subject to change on an annual basis through a public notice and comment process, may be lower than our current reimbursement rates.a reduction in sales of our services or a loss of one or more of our key commercial payors would adversely affect our business and operating results. a small number of commercial payors represent a significant percentage of our revenues. in the year ended december31, 2007, our top 10 commercial payors by revenues accounted for approximately 29.9% of our total revenues. our agreements with these commercial payors typically allow either party to the contract to terminate the contract by providing between 60 and 120days prior written notice to the other party at any time following the end of the initial term of the contract. our commercial payors may elect to terminate or not to renew their contracts with us for any reason and, in some instances can unilaterally change the reimbursement rates they pay. in the event any of our key commercial payors terminate their agreements with us, elect not to renew their agreements with us or elect not to enter into new agreements with us upon expiration of their agreements with us on terms as favorable as our current agreements, our business, operating results and prospects would be adversely affected.consolidation of commercial payors could result in payors eliminating coverage of our cardionet system or reduced reimbursement rates for our cardionet system. the commercial payor industry is undergoing significant consolidation. when payors combine their operations, the combined company may elect to reimburse our cardionet system at the lowest rate paid by any of the participants in the consolidation. if one of the payors participating in the consolidation does not reimburse for the cardionet system at all, the combined company may elect not to reimburse for the cardionet system. our reimbursement rates tend to be lower for larger payors. as a result, as payors consolidate, our average reimbursement rate may decline.our acquisition of pdsheart, as well as any other companies or technologies we may acquire in the future, could prove difficult to integrate and may disrupt our business and harm our operating results and prospects. our acquisition of pdsheart involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not take advantage of the cross-selling opportunities brought about by the acquisition. in addition, our acquisition of pdsheart, as well as acquisitions in which we may engage in the future, involve risks associated with our assumption of the liabilities of an acquired company, which may be liabilities that we were or are unaware of at the time of the acquisition, potential write-offs of acquired assets and potential loss of the acquired company's key employees or customers. we may encounter difficulties in successfully integrating our operations, technologies, services and personnel with that of the acquired company, and our financial and management resources may be diverted from our existing operations. for example, following our acquisition of pdsheart we have offices in pennsylvania, california, florida, georgia and minnesota. our offices in multiple states creates a strain on our ability to effectively manage our operations and key personnel. if we elect to consolidate our facilities we may lose key personnel unwilling to relocate to the consolidated facility, may have difficulty hiring appropriate personnel at the consolidated facility and may have difficulty providing continuity of service through the consolidation. physician and patient satisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or device could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation. additionally, potential disputes with the seller of an acquired business or its employees, suppliers or customers and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the pdsheart acquisition or any other acquisition we may pursue or to profitably deploy acquired assets. if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions, our business may be disrupted and our operating results and prospects may be harmed.if we are unable to manage our expected growth, our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected. our business plans call for rapid expansion of our sales and marketing operations and growth of our research and development, product development and administrative operations. we had a sales force of 27 account executives at december31, 2006 and 76 account executives at december31, 2007. we intend to expand our sales force to 89 individuals by december31, 2008. we expect this expansion will place a significant strain on our management and operational and financial resources. our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our anticipated growth. to manage our growth we will be required to improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls and expand, train and manage our growing employee base. if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, revenue growth may not be realized or may not be sustainable, may not result in improved operating results or earnings, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. our business is dependent upon having sufficient monitors and sensors. if we do not have enough monitors or sensors or experience delays in manufacturing, we may be unable to fill prescriptions in a timely manner, physicians may elect not to prescribe the cardionet system, and our revenues and growth prospects could be harmed. when a physician prescribes the cardionet system to a patient, our customer service department begins the patient hook-up process, which includes procuring a monitor and sensors from our distribution department and sending them to the patient. while our goal is to provide each patient with a monitor and sensors in a timely manner, we have experienced and may in the future experience delays due to the availability of monitors, primarily when converting to a new generation of monitor or, more recently, in connection with the increase in prescriptions following our acquisition of pdsheart. we may also experience shortages of monitors or sensors due to manufacturing difficulties. multiple suppliers provide the components used in the cardionet system, but our facilities in san diego, california are registered and approved by the united states food and drug administration, or fda, as the ultimate manufacturer of the cardionet system. our manufacturing operations could be disrupted by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster, a work stoppage or other labor-related disruption, failure in supply or other logistical channels, electrical outages or other reasons. if there was a disruption to our facilities in san diego, we would be unable to manufacture the cardionet system until we have restored and re-qualified our manufacturing capability or developed alternative manufacturing facilities. our success in obtaining future prescriptions from physicians is dependent upon our ability to promptly deliver monitors and sensors to our patients, and a failure in this regard would have an adverse effect on our revenues and growth prospects.interruptions or delays in telecommunications systems or in the data services provided to us by qualcomm or the loss of our wireless or data services could impair the delivery of our cardionet system services. the success of the cardionet system is dependent upon our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage data and to maintain and upgrade our data processing and communication capabilities. the monitors we use in connection with the cardionet system rely on a third party wireless carrier to transmit data over its data network during times that the monitor is removed from its base. all data sent by our monitors via this wireless data network or via landline is routed directly to qualcomm data centers and subsequently routed to our monitoring center. we are dependent upon these third parties to provide data transmission and data hosting services to us. we do not have an agreement directly with this third party wireless carrier. although we do have an agreement with qualcomm that has an initial termination date in september 2010, qualcomm may terminate its agreement with us if certain conditions occur, including if qualcomm's agreement with the third party wireless carrier terminates or in the event we fail to maintain an agreed-upon number of active cardiac monitoring devices on the qualcomm network. we have no control over the status of the agreement between qualcomm and the wireless carrier. if we fail to maintain our relationships with qualcomm or if we lose wireless carrier services, we would be forced to seek alternative providers of data transmission and data hosting services, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. as we expand our commercial activities, an increased burden will be placed upon our data processing systems and the equipment upon which they rely. interruptions of our data networks or the data networks of qualcomm for any extended length of time, loss of stored data or other computer problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. frequent or persistent interruptions in our arrhythmia monitoring services could cause permanent harm to our reputation and could cause current or potential users of the cardionet system or prescribing physicians to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors. such interruptions could result in liability, claims and litigation against us for damages or injuries resulting from the disruption in service. our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, break-ins, sabotage, and acts of vandalism. despite any precautions that we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in these services. we do not carry business interruption insurance to protect against losses that may result from interruptions in service as a result of system failures. moreover, the communications and information technology industries are subject to rapid and significant changes, and our ability to operate and compete is dependent in significant part on our ability to update and enhance the communication technologies used in our systems and services.the market for arrhythmia monitoring solutions is highly competitive. if our competitors are able to develop or market monitoring solutions that are more effective, or gain greater acceptance in the marketplace, than any solutions we develop, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated. the market for arrhythmia monitoring solutions is evolving rapidly and becoming increasingly competitive. our industry is highly fragmented and characterized by a small number of large providers and a large number of smaller regional service providers. these third parties compete with us in marketing to payors and prescribing physicians, recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, acquiring technology and developing solutions complementary to our programs. in addition, as companies with substantially greater resources than ours enter our market, we will face increased competition. if our competitors are better able to develop and patent arrhythmia monitoring solutions than us, or develop more effective and/or less expensive arrhythmia monitoring solutions that render our solutions obsolete or non-competitive or deploy larger or more effective marketing and sales resources than ours, our business will be harmed and our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.if we need to raise additional funding in the future, we may be unable to raise such capital when needed, or at all, and the terms of such capital may be adverse to our stockholders. we believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future. however, our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: the costs associated with manufacturing and building our inventory of our next generation c3 monitor; the costs of hiring additional personnel and investing in infrastructure; the reimbursement rates associated with our products and services; actions taken by the fda, cms and other regulatory authorities affecting the cardionet system and competitive products; our ability to secure contracts with additional commercial payors providing for the reimbursement of our services; the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments; the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights or defending against claims of infringement by others; and the costs of investing in additional lines of business outside of arrhythmia monitoring solutions. if we need to, or choose to, raise additional capital in the future, such capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result. if we raise additional funds by incurring additional debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.our manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. if we or our suppliers fail to achieve or maintain regulatory approval of these manufacturing facilities, our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed. we currently manufacture the monitors and sensors for the cardionet system in san diego, california. monitors used in the provision of services by pdsheart are purchased from several third parties. in order to maintain compliance with fda and other regulatory requirements, our manufacturing facilities must be periodically re-evaluated and qualified under a quality system to ensure they meet production and quality standards. suppliers of components of and products used to manufacture the cardionet system and the manufacturers of the monitors used in the provision of services by pdsheart must also comply with fda and foreign regulatory requirements, which often require significant resources and subject us and our suppliers to potential regulatory inspections and stoppages. we or our suppliers may not satisfy these requirements. if we or our suppliers do not maintain regulatory approval for our manufacturing operations, our business would be harmed.our dependence on a limited number of suppliers may prevent us from delivering our devices on a timely basis. we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers of components for the cardionet system. if these suppliers became unable to provide components in the volumes needed or at an acceptable price, we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements from alternative sources of supply. qualifying suppliers is a lengthy process. delays or interruptions in the supply of our requirements could limit or stop our ability to provide sufficient quantities of devices on a timely basis, meet demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.we could be subject to medical liability or product liability claims which may not be covered by insurance and which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. the design, manufacture and marketing of services of the types we provide entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. any such claims against us may require us to incur significant defense costs, irrespective of whether such claims have merit. in addition, we provide information to health care providers and payors upon which determinations affecting medical care are made, and claims may be made against us resulting from adverse medical consequences to patients resulting from the information we provide. in addition, we may become subject to liability in the event that the monitors and sensors we use fail to correctly record or transfer patient information or if we provide incorrect information to patients or health care providers using our services. we have also agreed to indemnify qualcomm for any claims resulting from the provision of our services. if we incur one or more significant claims against us, if we are required to indemnify qualcomm as a result of the provision of our services, or if we are required to undertake remedial actions in response to any such claims, such claims or actions would adversely affect our business and results of operations. our liability insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. in addition, our current insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, the coverages may not be adequate to protect us against any future claims. if we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect against any claims against us, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. if we do not obtain and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property, the value of our technology and devices may be adversely affected. our business and competitive positions are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology. to protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, employment, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements and protective contractual provisions with other third parties. we attempt to protect our intellectual property position by filing trademark applications and u.s., foreign and international patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. as of december31, 2007, we had 14 issued u.s. patents, seven foreign patents and 42 pending u.s., foreign and international patent applications relating to various aspects of the cardionet system. as of december31, 2007, we also had 11 trademark registrations and one pending trademark application in the united states for a variety of word marks and slogans. we do not believe that any single patent, trademark or other intellectual property right of ours, or combination of our intellectual property rights, is likely to prevent others from competing with us using a similar business model. there are many issued patents and patent applications held by others in our industry and the electronics field. our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially similar or superior to our technologies, or design around our patents or other intellectual property to avoid infringement. in addition, we may not apply for a patent relating to products or processes that are patentable, we may fail to receive any patent for which we apply or have applied, and any patent owned by us or issued to us could be circumvented, challenged, invalidated, or held to be unenforceable, or rights granted thereunder may not adequately protect our technology or provide a competitive advantage to us. for example, with respect to one of our u.s. patents, we have a corresponding foreign patent, the claims of which were amended substantially more so than in the united states, to overcome art that was of record in the u.s. patent. if a third-party challenges the validity of any patents or proprietary rights of ours, we may become involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation that would be costly and time-consuming. although third parties may infringe our patents and other intellectual property rights, we may not be aware of any such infringement, or we may be aware of potential infringement but elect not to seek to prevent such infringement or pursue any claim of infringement, and the third party may continue its potentially infringing activities. we believe that lifewatchcorp. may be infringing our intellectual property rights and have filed a lawsuit against lifewatch, as is discussed in greater detail in "legal proceedings." any decision whether or not to take further action in response to the activities of lifewatch or any other potential infringement of our patent or other intellectual property rights may be based on any one or more of a variety of factors, such as the potential costs and benefits of taking such action, and business and legal issues and circumstances. litigation of claims of infringement of a patent or other intellectual property rights may be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of key company personnel, and may not be successful or result in any significant recovery of compensation for any infringement or enjoining of any infringing activity. litigation or licensing discussions may also involve or lead to counterclaims or proceedings that could be brought by a potential infringer to challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property. to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we generally require our e</th>

    <th>RISK FACTORS An investment in the shares of Common Stock offered hereby is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information in this Prospectus, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in the shares of Common Stock offered hereby. Development Stage Company; History of Operating Losses; and Negative Cash Flow. Sylvan and MCI organized Caliber in November 1996. To date, Caliber has been engaged principally in development activities. The Company generated minimal revenues during 1997 and, therefore, has incurred operating losses and negative cash flow since inception. As of December 31, 1997, Caliber had accumulated losses of approximately $15.2 million, and the Company expects to continue to incur significant losses for at least the next two years. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability or generate positive cash flow. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."Significant Cash Requirements. The Company's continued development, construction, expansion and operation of its learning network will require substantial capital. The Company's ability to fund its planned expenditures and operations depends upon its ability to obtain sufficient equity and debt financing. The Company's initial capitalization consisted of $13.0 million in equity from Sylvan, MCI and the other initial stockholders. MCI agreed to provide $20.0 million, as needed, in lease financing or lease guarantees for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and Sylvan agreed to guarantee up to $3.0 million of the Company's debt or to provide up to a $3.0 million line of credit, at an interest rate of 1% above the NationsBank prime rate. As of December 31, 1997, $4.0 million of MCI's Lease and Guarantee Commitment had been used and all of the Sylvan Loan had been drawn. During 1997, the Company received $2.6 million in partial payment of the Sylvan Subscription. The Company expects to receive approximately $57.9 million in net proceeds from this offering and approximately $5.4 million from Sylvan's payment of the balance due on the Sylvan Subscription. Of these amounts, $3.3 million will be used to repay the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the Sylvan Loan, $2.9 million to repay deferred management fees to Sylvan and $1.2 million to pay accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. This will leave Caliber with approximately $55.9 million of net proceeds from this offering and payment of the balance of the Sylvan Subscription, $16.0 million of unused lease commitments from MCI, $3.0 million of available borrowings under the Sylvan Loan and $3.9 million of existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 1997. There can be no assurance that these cash resources following this offering will be sufficient to fund the Company's expected negative cash flow and its capital expenditures. The Company, therefore, may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financing necessary to satisfy its cash requirements or to implement its growth strategy successfully, in which event the Company will be forced to curtail its planned business expansion and may be unable to fund its ongoing operations. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."Technology and Technology Implementation Risks. The successful operation of the Caliber network requires the development of sophisticated software and the integration of a number of diverse communications technologies. To date, Caliber has only tested the software and the network under simulated operating conditions and operated the network under actual operating conditions on a limited basis. The ability of the network to function as intended at multiple sites simultaneously cannot be confirmed until a significant volume of actual programs are regularly delivered over the Caliber network. Technical difficulties may prevent or delay the Company's offering of educational programs, which is likely to have a material adverse effect on market acceptance of the network for distance learning. See "Business--Caliber Technology."Risk of Non-Acceptance of Caliber Learning Concept. Use of the Caliber Campuses will require a significant change in the way universities, corporations and working adults experience graduate level learning and professional training. Prominent universities may be unwilling to accept the Caliber network as an appropriate way to provide quality education, and faculty members may be unwilling to use the Caliber network 7 to teach. Corporations and students may not accept the Caliber network as an alternative to traditional classroom instruction. If the Caliber network fails to gain this acceptance, it is unlikely that Caliber will ever become a viable business. See "Business--The Caliber Network."Rapid Expansion of Operations. The Company plans to expand its business rapidly. The Company currently has 34 Caliber Campuses open and expects to have 41 Caliber Campuses open in 40 markets by September 1998. There can be no assurance that all 41 Caliber Campuses will be opened on schedule. The Company's ability to manage its rapid expansion effectively will require it to develop effective operating, financial and accounting systems and to add and retain qualified personnel at each Caliber Campus and at the corporate level. Failure to develop financial controls and accounting and reporting systems or add and retain personnel that adequately support the Company's growth will materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business--Employees" and "Management."Reliance on Sylvan Management and Systems. Currently, the Company relies extensively on Sylvan's resources, systems and personnel for management, administrative, legal, accounting and financial functions. The Company also uses office space leased by Sylvan. Sylvan has agreed to provide payroll, legal, accounting and other services and lease space only through 1999 for a fee of $2.0 million in each of 1998 and 1999 and is not obligated to continue to do so thereafter. During the next two years, the Company will be required to develop its own systems to replace those currently provided by Sylvan and to add and integrate a substantial number of new managerial, finance, accounting and support personnel. Failure to develop these systems or add and retain personnel to manage the Company's business effectively would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and growth. See "Business-- Employees," "Management" and "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions-- Sylvan Management Agreement."Dependence on Skilled Personnel. The ability to provide distance learning services as contemplated by the Company will require the services of skilled technicians and educational facilitators. In addition, the Company will need additional marketing and sales personnel to support planned growth. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in adding or retaining the necessary personnel. Failure to do so is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and growth. See "Business--Marketing and Sales" and--"Employees."Dependence on Strategic Partners. The Company's success will depend upon establishing and maintaining strategic alliances with prominent universities and corporations to provide high quality educational and training programs. However, to date, only Johns Hopkins, Wharton, Compaq, Macmillan and MCI Systemhouse have agreed to provide programs through the Caliber network, with Johns Hopkins and Wharton each agreeing to deliver only a single program. Many of these contracts are terminable if Caliber fails to achieve stated performance objectives contained in these contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining and expanding these existing relationships or that it will be able to establish and maintain new strategic relationships with other prominent universities or corporations. If the initial programs are unsuccessful, if these universities and corporations do not expand their offerings through the Caliber network or if Caliber is unable to enter into other strategic relationships, it is unlikely that Caliber will become a viable business. See "Business--Strategy."Untested Business Plan. The Company made numerous assumptions in developing its business plan, such as the number of students expected to enroll in a given program, the prices the Company will be able to charge for programs, the rate at which additional programs will be added to the Caliber network and the cost of operating Caliber Campuses. The assumptions underlying Caliber's business plan may prove to be too optimistic, and the Company may encounter delays in achieving the objectives in its business plan. This is likely to result in lower than planned revenues, higher than expected expenses and sustained unprofitability. The Company can give no assurance that it will be able to adjust its operations and business plan. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 8Significant Regulation. Many of the states in which Caliber intends to operate Caliber Campuses require that any entity providing educational programs obtain a license to operate. Since Caliber's distance learning concept is novel and state authorities may not have substantial experience with arrangements of this type, the Company cannot predict with certainty whether states will grant the licenses necessary to offer educational programs at all Caliber Campuses. Certain states accept accreditation as evidence of meeting minimum state standards for a license, and other states apply separate standards. Accreditation organizations may require prior approval and periodic monitoring of distance learning programs. Caliber expects that each university offering courses through the Caliber network will be required to obtain the necessary license, possibly one for each program offered, in each state where a Caliber Campus is located. If the Company or the universities are unable to obtain the necessary licenses or accreditations or if the licenses or accreditations are delayed or revoked, Caliber's business and growth may be materially adversely affected.Congress is expected to consider reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended ("HEA"), in 1998. Treatment of distance learning is expected to be a major topic in the reauthorization process. There can be no assurance that the HEA will not be amended to impose stricter or additional requirements which would affect the Company. In addition, state and federal regulation of distance learning programs, as well as private accreditation of such programs, are undergoing significant review by the U.S. Department of Education, state regulators and accreditation organizations. Caliber cannot predict the scope or the outcome of this review, but additional regulation of distance learning may result from this review. This additional regulation may adversely affect the way Caliber intends to deliver educational content over its network. See "Business--Government Regulation."Rapid Technological Change. The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and the Company's future success will depend on its ability to implement technological advances. Caliber anticipates that if interactive distance learning becomes accepted as an effective means of providing educational and training programs, the industry will evolve rapidly. To remain competitive, Caliber must be able to respond quickly to evolving industry trends, technological advances and changes in client needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in adapting to these trends, advances or changes. In addition, technologies developed by competitors may significantly reduce demand for the Company's services or render the Company's services obsolete. See "Business--Caliber Technology."Competition. Competition among providers of lifelong learning and professional training is intense. Management believes that its principal potential competitors will be prominent universities located in the markets served by Caliber Campuses. In each of Caliber's markets, there are also other two-year and four-year colleges which have their own continuing education and graduate level programs. Each of these competitors offers live classroom instruction and has an established reputation in the educational field and, therefore, may enjoy a competitive advantage. In addition, two-year and four- year higher education institutions, particularly public institutions, are offering distance education courses, and several distance education initiatives are currently underway among public higher education institutions. Other competitors include for-profit educational organizations, such as the Apollo Group's University of Phoenix, Strayer University and DeVry's Keller School of Management, that provide lifelong learning programs targeted to working adults and feature live classroom instruction. Caliber may also compete with distance learning companies that offer self-paced correspondence courses, videos, audiocassettes and other distance learning products. More recent distance learning products include CD-rom and Internet-based instruction. If the Caliber distance learning concept proves successful, Caliber expects competitors to enter the market. For example, businesses that have facilities in multiple markets that could be linked by satellite, such as major hotel and movie theater chains, could decide to establish networks of distance learning facilities to compete with Caliber. Westcott Communications, Inc., which has established a one-way satellite-based network currently used by a number of larger corporations to distribute their training programs, could decide to make its network interactive. The Company also competes against a significant number of third party training companies that provide various training programs to corporations. In addition, corporations may continue to use internal resources to satisfy their training needs. See "Business--Competition." 9Limited Protection of Proprietary Expertise and Methodologies. The Company's success will be highly dependent upon its specialized and proprietary expertise, methodologies and software. The Company must rely on a combination of trade secret laws, employee nondisclosure policies and third-party confidentiality agreements. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such rights or that third parties will not independently develop functionally equivalent or superior methodologies or software. There also can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company relative to the Company's methodologies, which could result in costly litigation or the need to establish license arrangements. The Company intends to seek a patent on certain design features of its network. However, there can be no assurance this patent will be granted or, if granted, that it will cover all the proprietary features of the network. See "Business--Proprietary Rights."Dependence on Management. The Company is highly dependent on the members of its senior management, particularly Messrs. Nguyen, Frier, Dobkin, Polivka, Locher and Peterson, the loss of any of whose services may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of critical development, marketing and other business objectives. If the Company's business expands, attracting and retaining additional qualified management personnel will be critical to the Company's success. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to expand its business. The Company does not have employment contracts with senior management. The Company is in the process of obtaining a $3 million "key man" insurance policy on Mr. Nguyen's life. See "Management."Control by Existing Stockholders. Upon completion of this offering, MCI, Sylvan, Mr. Hoehn-Saric and Mr. Becker will beneficially own 1,242,513, 1,227,393, 1,718,351 and 1,718,351 shares of Common Stock, respectively, and Sylvan will own 5,167,328 shares of 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, which is convertible at any time after the second anniversary of this offering into an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, MCI, Sylvan and Messrs. Hoehn-Saric and Becker together will control approximately 49.1% of the Common Stock (or 66.7% if Sylvan were to convert all of its shares of 6% Non-Voting Preferred Stock to Common Stock and MCI were to exercise the MCI warrant). This is likely to be sufficient to enable them to effectively control the outcome of any matter submitted to the stockholders, assuming they choose to vote their shares together. See "Principal and Selling Stockholders" and "Description of Capital Stock."Substantial Proceeds of Offering Payable to Sylvan and MCI. Of the net proceeds of this offering, the Company will use $3.3 million to pay accrued interest and principal on the Sylvan Loan, $1.2 million to pay MCI accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and $2.9 million to pay accrued management fees due to Sylvan. As a result, a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering will not be available to the Company to fund its operations and planned growth. See "Use of Proceeds."Potential Conflicts of Interest. Conflicts of interest may arise between the Company, Sylvan and MCI in a number of areas relating to their ongoing or future relationships. There are no non-competition agreements between Caliber and either Sylvan or MCI. Sylvan currently provides substantial management and administrative services to Caliber but is not obligated to continue to do so after 1999. MCI has agreed to provide $20.0 million of lease financing to Caliber, as needed, and provides various ongoing telecommunications services to Caliber. Caliber may enter into additional material transactions and agreements with Sylvan and MCI in the future. MCI, Sylvan and Sterling Caliber have the right to require that their shares of Caliber Common Stock be registered for sale under the Securities Act at various times over the next four years and may decide to sell their shares in the public market at any time. Directors of the Company who are also directors or employees of Sylvan or MCI may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting the Company, such as financing, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities. There can be no assurance that these or any other conflicts of interest will be resolved in favor of the Company. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."Shares Eligible for Future Sale. Upon completion of this offering, the Company will have outstanding 12,018,642 shares of Common Stock, plus 1,162,895 shares issuable upon exercise of currently outstanding options, 1,193,573 shares issuable upon exercise of the MCI Warrant and 5,167,328 shares issuable upon 10 conversion by Sylvan of the 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock. The 5,700,000 shares offered hereby will be freely transferable unless acquired by affiliates of the Company. All of the remaining outstanding shares, upon expiration of the Underwriters' lock-up described below, will be saleable under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, unless then held by affiliates of the Company. The 1,162,895 shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options and the 985,133 shares reserved for future grants under the Company's 1998 Plan will be registered under the Securities Act upon completion of this offering. Those shares will be freely transferable upon issuance unless held by affiliates of the Company. The Company has granted MCI, Sylvan and Sterling Caliber, who hold an aggregate of 7,100,181 shares of Common Stock (assuming exercise of the MCI Warrant) shares of Common Stock and 5,167,328 shares of 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, the right to have their shares of Common Stock registered under the Securities Act on one or more occasions over the next four years. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale."Sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock following this offering, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the Common Stock and could impair the Company's ability to raise capital through an offering of its equity securities. All of the Company's officers and employees who own Common Stock, or hold options to purchase 7,500 shares or more, have agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any of their shares for a period of two years after the date of this Prospectus without the prior written consent of both BT Alex. Brown Incorporated and the Company. Sylvan, MCI and Sterling Caliber, who will hold in the aggregate 7,100,181 shares of Common Stock and 5,167,328 shares of 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock upon completion of this offering, have agreed not to sell or dispose of any of their shares for a period of one year after the date of this Prospectus without the prior written consent of BT Alex. Brown Incorporated. See "Underwriting."No Prior Market for Common Stock; Possible Volatility of Stock Price. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock, and there can be no assurance that an active public market for the Common Stock will develop or be sustained after the offering. The initial public offering price was determined by negotiations among the Company and the Representatives of the Underwriters and may not be indicative of market prices of the Common Stock after this offering. See "Underwriting." The market price of the Common Stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in Caliber's quarterly operating results and other events or factors, such as Caliber's announcement of new strategic alliances with prominent universities or corporations, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and announcements by other companies in the lifelong learning industry. Moreover, the stock market and the market prices of the shares of many emerging growth companies in recent years have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific company. Broad stock market fluctuations, as well as economic conditions generally, may adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. There can be no assurance that the market price of the Common Stock will not decline below the initial public offering price.Certain Anti-takeover Provisions. Certain provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Charter") and Maryland law may have the effect of discouraging a change of control of the Company or deterring tender offers for the Common Stock. The Charter grants to the Board of Directors authority to issue shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which the holders of some of the shares of Common Stock might receive a premium over the then-prevailing market price of the Common Stock. The Charter also divides the Board of Directors into three classes of Directors who will serve for staggered terms, which may have the effect of inhibiting or delaying a change of control of the Company. A Director may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. See "Description of Capital Stock--Anti- takeover Provisions of Charter and By-Laws."The Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL") prohibits certain business combinations between a Maryland corporation and any person who owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's capital stock (an "Interested Stockholder") or an affiliate thereof for a period of five years after the most recent date on which the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder and imposes additional requirements on the approval and terms of the transaction. The MGCL also provides that shares acquired by a stockholder which 11</th>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this prospectus, before deciding to invest in our common stock. risks related to our business general business and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. our businesses and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the united states. if the u.s.economy is unable to steadily emerge from the recession that began in 2007 or we experience worsening economic conditions, such as a so-called double-dip recession, our growth and profitability could be constrained. in addition, economic conditions in foreign countries can affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder the u.s.economic recovery. financial markets remain concerned about the ability of certain european countries, particularly greece, ireland, portugal, spain and italy, to finance and service their debt. the default by any one of these countries on their debt payments could lead to weaker economic conditions in the united states. weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, including a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. all of these factors are detrimental to our business. our business is significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the u.s.federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities, or gses. changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition. liquidity is essential to our business. actions by the federal home loan bank of atlanta, or fhlb, or the frb may reduce our borrowing capacity. additionally, we may not be able to attract deposits at competitive rates. an inability to raise funds through traditional deposits, brokered deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity or result in increased funding costs. furthermore, we invest in several asset classes, including significant investments in mortgage servicing rights, or msr, which may be less liquid in certain markets. liquidity may also be adversely impacted by bank supervisory and regulatory authorities mandating changes in the composition of our balance sheet to asset classes that are less liquid. our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. in addition, our access to deposits may be affected by the liquidity and/or cash flow needs of depositors. although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and fhlb advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future and can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds and increase our funding costs if, among other things, customers move funds out of bank deposits and into alternative investments, such as the stock market, that are perceived as providing superior expected returns. furthermore, an inability to increase our deposit base at all or at attractive rates would impede our ability to fund our continued growth, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 17 our ability to raise funds through deposits or borrowings could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets. although we consider our sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs, we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future. we may be required to seek additional regulatory capital through capital raising at terms that may be very dilutive to existing stockholders. likewise, we may need to incur additional debt in the future to achieve our business objectives, in connection with future acquisitions or for other reasons. any borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on favorable terms.our financial results are significantly affected in a number of ways by changes in interest rates, which may make our results volatile and difficult to predict from quarter to quarter. most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, which subjects us to significant risks from changes in interest rates and can impact our net income and the valuation of our assets and liabilities. our operating results depend to a great extent on our net interest margin, which is the difference between the amount of interest income we earn and the amount of interest expense we incur. if the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing deposits, borrowings and other liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, would be adversely affected. our earnings also could be adversely affected if the rates on our loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits and other liabilities. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the frb. a strengthening u.s.economy would be expected to cause the frb to increase short-term interest rates, which would increase our borrowing costs and may reduce our profit margins. a sustained low interest rate environment could cause many of our loans subject to adjustable rates to reprice downward to lower interest rates, which would decrease our loan yields and reduce our profit margins. changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on our mortgage loan origination revenues. historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the demand for mortgage loans and interest rates. mortgage origination volume and revenues usually decline during periods of rising or high interest rates and increase during periods of declining or low interest rates. changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of a significant percentage of the assets on our balance sheet. furthermore, our msr are valued based on a number of factors, including assumptions about borrower repayment rates, which are heavily influenced by prevailing interest rates. when interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. as the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our msr can decrease, which, in turn, may reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. we recorded a $39.5million impairment charge related to msr for the year ended december31, 2011. in addition, mortgage loans held for sale for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist and other interests we hold related to residential loan sales and securitizations are carried at fair value. the value of these assets may be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. we may not correctly or adequately hedge this risk, and even if we do hedge the risk with derivatives and other instruments, we may still incur significant losses from changes in the value of these assets or from changes in the value of the hedging instruments. even though originating mortgage loans, which benefit from declining rates, and servicing mortgage loans, which benefit from rising rates, can act as a natural hedge to soften the overall impact of changes in rates on our consolidated financial results, the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. for example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of 18 residential msr is generally immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the msr relating to the new loans would generally accrue over time. in addition, in recent quarters it has become apparent that even a low interest rate environment may not result in a significant increase in mortgage originations in light of other macroeconomic variable factors, declining real estate values and changes in underwriting standards resulting from the recent recession. we enter into forward starting swaps as a hedging strategy related to our expected future issuances of debt. this hedging strategy allows us to fix the interest rate margin between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities. a continued prolonged period of lower interest rates could affect the duration of our interest earning assets and adversely impact our operations in future periods.we may be required to make further increases in our provisions for loan and lease losses and to charge-off additional loans and leases in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations. the real estate market in the united states since late 2007 has been characterized by high delinquency rates and price deterioration. despite historically low interest rates beginning in 2008, higher credit standards, weak employment, slow economic growth and an overall de-leveraging in the residential and commercial sectors have perpetuated these trends. we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease loss expense that represents managements best estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. the level of the allowance reflects managements judgment with respect to: continuing evaluation of specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan and lease portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; industry concentrations;and other unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. if current trends in the real estate markets continue, we expect that we will continue to experience increased delinquencies and credit losses, particularly with respect to construction, land development and land loans. in addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses, which would result in a decrease in net income and capital, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.mortgage loan modification and refinancing programs and future legislative action may adversely affect the value of, and our returns on, residential mortgage-backed securities and on msr. the u.s.government, through the frb, the fha and the fdic, has initiated a number of loss mitigation programs designed to afford relief to homeowners facing foreclosure and to assist borrowers whose home value is less than the principal on their mortgage, including the home 19 affordable modification program, or hamp, which provides homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures, the hope for homeowners program, or h4h program, which allows certain distressed borrowers to refinance their mortgages into federal housing administration, or fha, insured loans in order to avoid residential mortgage loan foreclosures, and the home affordable refinancing program, or harp, which make it easier for borrowers to refinance at lower interest rates. these loan modification programs, future legislative or regulatory actions, including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws, which result in the modification of outstanding residential mortgage loans, as well as changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing mortgage loans with fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae, may adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, or mbs, and on the value of our msr. our msr is valued based on a number of factors, including assumptions about borrower repayment rates and costs of servicing. if the interest rate on a mortgage is adjusted, or if a borrower is permitted to refinance at a lower rate, or the costs of servicing or costs of foreclosures increase, the value of our msr with respect to that mortgage can decrease, which, in turn, may reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. in addition, increases in our servicing costs from changes to our foreclosure and other servicing practices, including resulting from the consent orders, adversely affects the fair value of our msr.our commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to risks that may be greater than the risks related to our other mortgage loans and a high percentage of these loans are secured by properties located in florida. many analysts and economists are predicting that commercial mortgage loans could continue to see further deterioration. at december31, 2011, our commercial real estate loans, net of discounts, were $1.0billion, or approximately 11% of our total loan portfolio, net of allowances. commercial real estate loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than residential mortgage loans or home equity loans. the repayment of these loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate or commercial projects. if the cash flow from the project is reduced, a borrowers ability to repay the loan may be impaired. furthermore, the repayment of commercial mortgage loans is generally less predictable and more difficult to evaluate and monitor and collateral may be more difficult to dispose of in a market decline. in such cases, we may be compelled to modify the terms of the loan or engage in other potentially expensive work-out techniques. any significant failure to pay on time by our customers would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. as a result of our 2010 acquisition of the banking operations of bank of florida in an fdic-assisted transaction, we have increased our exposure to risks related to economic conditions in florida. unlike our residential mortgage loan portfolio, which is more geographically diverse, approximately 81% of our commercial loans as of december31, 2011, are secured by properties located in florida. florida has experienced a deeper recession and more dramatic slowdown in economic activity than other states and the decline in real estate values in florida has been significantly higher than the national average. our concentration of commercial loans in this region subjects us to risk that a further downturn in the local economy could result in increases in delinquencies and foreclosures or losses on these loans. in addition, the occurrence of natural disasters in florida, such as hurricanes, or man-made disasters, such as the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico, could result in a decline in the value or destruction of our mortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies or foreclosures. losses we may experience on loans acquired from bank of florida may be covered by loss sharing agreements we entered into with the fdic in connection with the acquisition. see business recent acquisitions acquisition of bank of florida. nevertheless, these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. conditions in the real estate market and higher than normal delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our business. the origination and servicing of residential mortgages is a significant component of our business and our earnings have been and may continue to be adversely affected by weak real estate markets and historically high delinquency and default rates. mortgage origination volume has been low in recent fiscal periods compared to historical levels (and refinancing activity in particular) and may remain low for the foreseeable future even if economic trends improve, particularly if interest rates significantly rise and more restrictive underwriting standards persist. at december31, 2011, our msr assets decreased by approximately 15%, from december31, 2010 with msr at the end of such period representing 4% of total assets and 43% of our tier1 capital plus the general allowance for loan and lease losses. if the frequency and severity of our loan delinquencies and default rates increase, we could experience losses on loans held for investment and on newly originated or purchased loans that we hold for sale. during 2009, we experienced an increase in foreclosures and reserves due to an increase in loss severity and foreclosure frequency resulting primarily from a decline in housing prices during 2008 and 2009. we may need to further increase our reserves for foreclosures if foreclosure rates return to the levels experienced in these recent periods. continued or worsening conditions in the real estate market and higher than normal delinquency and default rates on loans have other adverse consequences for our mortgage banking business, including: cash flows and capital resources are reduced, as we are required to make cash advances to meet contractual obligations to investors, process foreclosures, maintain, repair and market foreclosed properties; mortgage service fee revenues decline because we recognize these revenues only upon collection; net interest income may decline and interest expense may increase due to lower average cash and capital balances and higher capital funding requirements; mortgage and loan servicing costs rise; an inability to sell our msr in the capital markets due to reduced liquidity; amortization and impairment charges on our msr increase;and realized and unrealized losses on and declines in the liquidity of securities held in our investment portfolio that are collateralized by mortgage obligations.we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans with identified defects, indemnify the investor or guarantor, or reimburse the investor for credit loss incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of representations or warranties. we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse investors as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties, from our sales of loans we originate and servicing of loans originated by other parties. we conduct these activities under contractual provisions that include various representations and warranties which typically cover ownership of the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, validity of the lien securing the loan and similar matters. we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans with identified defects, indemnify the investor or guarantor, or reimburse the investor for credit loss incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of such contractual representations or warranties. we experienced increased levels of repurchase demands in 2010 and further increased levels in 2011 as compared to prior periods, which has led to material increases in our loan repurchase reserves and we may need to increase such reserves in the future, which would adversely affect net 21 income. as of december 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 our loan repurchase reserve for loans that we sold or securitized was $3.6 million, $26.8 million and $32.0 million, respectively. in addition, we also service residential mortgage loans where a gse is the owner of the underlying mortgage loan asset. prior to late 2009, we had not historically experienced a significant amount of repurchases related to the servicing of mortgage loans as we were indemnified by the seller of the servicing rights but due to the failures of several of our counterparties, in 2010 and 2011 we have experienced losses related to the repurchase of loans from gses and subsequent disposal or payment demands from the gses. as of december 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 our reserve for servicing repurchase losses was $6.3 million, $30.0 million and $30.4 million, respectively. if future repurchase demands remain at these heightened levels or increase further or the severity of the repurchase requests increases, or our success at appealing repurchase or other requests differs from past experience, we may need to further increase our loan repurchase reserves, and increased repurchase obligations could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. for additional information, see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loans subject to representations and warranties.our concentration of mass-affluent customers and so-called jumbo mortgages in our residential mortgage portfolio makes us particularly vulnerable to a downturn in high-end real estate values and economic factors disproportionately affecting affluent consumers of financial services. the federal housing administration, fannie mae and freddie mac will only purchase or guarantee so-called conforming loans, which may not exceed certain principal amount thresholds. as of december31, 2011, approximately 61% of our residential mortgage loans held for investment was comprised of so-called jumbo loans based on the current threshold of $417,000 in most states, and 91% of the carrying value of our securities portfolio was comprised of residential nonagency investment securities, substantially all of which are backed by jumbo loans. jumbo loans have principal balances exceeding the thresholds of the agencies described above, and tend to be less liquid than conforming loans, which may make it more difficult for us to rapidly rebalance our portfolio and risk profile than is the case for financial institutions with higher concentrations of conforming loan assets. due to macroeconomic conditions, jumbo mortgage loans have, in recent periods, experienced increased rates of delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss, and they are likely to continue to experience delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss rates that are higher, and that may be substantially higher, than conforming mortgage loans. in such event, liquidity in the capital markets for such assets could be diminished and we could be faced with increased losses and an inability to dispose of such assets.hedging strategies that we use to manage our mortgage pipeline may be ineffective to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. we typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge a portion of our mortgage banking interest rate risk. hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. we may use hedging instruments tied to u.s.treasury rates, london interbank offered rate, or libor, or eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. our mortgage pipeline consists of our commitments to purchase mortgage loans, or interest rate locks, and funded mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary market. the risk associated with the mortgage pipeline is that interest rates will fluctuate between the time we commit to purchase a loan at a pre-determined price, or the customer locks in the interest rate on a loan, and the time we sell or commit to sell the mortgage loan. generally speaking, if interest rates increase, the value of an unhedged mortgage pipeline decreases, and gain on sale margins are adversely impacted. typically, we hedge the risk of overall changes in fair value of loans held for sale by either entering into forward loan sale agreements, selling forward fannie mae or freddie mac mbs or using other derivative instruments to hedge loan commitments and to create fair 22 value hedges against the funded loan portfolios. we generally do not hedge all of the interest rate risk on our mortgage portfolio and have not historically hedged the risk of changes in the fair value of our msr resulting from changes in interest rates. to the extent we fail to appropriately reduce our exposure to interest rate changes, our financial results may be adversely affected.we could recognize realized and unrealized losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if economic and market conditions deteriorate. as of december31, 2011, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $2.1billion, of which approximately 90% was comprised of residential nonagency investment securities. factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. these factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the credit markets. any of these factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. the process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.we may experience higher delinquencies on our equipment leases and reductions in the resale value of leased equipment. in connection with the acquisition of tygris, we acquired a significant portfolio of equipment leases. although we purchased these leases at a discount, they were not subjected to our credit standards. the non-impaired leases we acquired may become impaired and the impaired leases may suffer further deterioration in value, resulting in additional charge-offs to this portfolio. fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions may increase the level of charge-offs that we make to our lease portfolio, and, consequently, reduce our net income. although a significant portion of these losses will be satisfied out of escrowed portions of the purchase price paid by us, we are not protected for all losses and any charge-off of related losses that we experience will negatively impact our results of operations. the realization of equipment values (i.e., residual values) during the life and at the end of the term of a lease is an important element of our commercial finance business. at the inception of each lease, we record a residual value for the leased equipment based on our estimate of the future value of the equipment at the expected disposition date. a decrease in the market value of leased equipment at a rate greater than the rate we projected, whether due to rapid technological or economic obsolescence, unusual or excessive wear-and-tear on the equipment, recession or other adverse economic conditions, or other factors, would adversely affect the current or the residual values of such equipment. further, certain equipment residual values are dependent on the manufacturers or vendors warranties, reputation and other factors, including market liquidity. in addition, we may not realize the full market value of equipment if we are required to sell it to meet liquidity needs or for other reasons outside of the ordinary course of business. consequently, we may not realize our estimated residual values for equipment. if we are unable to realize the expected value of a substantial portion of the equipment under lease, our business could be adversely affected.we may become subject to a number of risks if we elect to pursue acquisitions and may not be able to acquire and integrate acquisition targets successfully if we choose to do so. as we have done in the past, we may pursue acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. we may consider acquisitions of loans or securities portfolios, lending or leasing firms, commercial and 23 small business lenders, residential lenders, direct banks, banks or bank branches (whether in fdic-assisted or unassisted transactions), wealth and investment management firms, securities brokerage firms, specialty finance or other financial services-related companies. we expect that competition for suitable acquisition targets may be significant. additionally, we must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire an institution or business. such regulatory approval may be denied or, if granted, could be subject to conditions that materially affect the terms of the acquisition or our ability to capture some of the opportunities presented by the acquisition. we may not be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on terms and conditions we consider to be acceptable. even if suitable candidates are identified and we succeed in consummating these transactions, acquisitions involve risks that may adversely affect our market value and profitability. these risks include, among other things: credit risk associated with acquired loans and investments; retaining, attracting and integrating personnel; loss of customers; reputational risks; difficulties in integrating or operating acquired businesses or assets; and potential disruption of our ongoing business operations and diversion of managements attention. through our acquisitions we may also assume unknown or undisclosed liabilities, fail to properly assess known contingent liabilities or assume businesses with internal control deficiencies. while in most of our transactions we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, adequate due diligence and indemnification provisions, we cannot be certain that the due diligence we have conducted is adequate or that the indemnification provisions and other risk mitigants we put in place will be sufficient. in addition, fdic-assisted acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks even though the fdic might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing in the exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of a failed institution. however, because these acquisitions are typically conducted by the fdic in a manner that does not allow the time normally associated with preparing for the integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks in fdic-assisted transactions. these risks include, among other things, the loss of customers, strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems. we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly during periods in wh</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus. we believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this prospectus. if any of the following risks comes to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. in these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our business and industrywe have a history of net losses and may never become profitable. we have incurred net losses from our inception through december31, 2007, including net losses of $11.5million for the year ended december31, 2005, $7.6million for the year ended december31, 2006 and $0.4million for the year ended december31, 2007. even giving effect to the pdsheart acquisition, we are operating at a loss, with pro forma losses for the year ended december31, 2007, giving effect to the acquisition, of $0.3million. as of december31, 2007, we had total shareholders' deficit of approximately $26.9million. we expect our operating expenses to increase as we, among other things: expand our sales and marketing activities; invest in designing, manufacturing and building our inventory of future generations of the cardionet system; hire additional personnel; invest in infrastructure; and incur the additional expenses associated with being a public company. with increasing expenses, we will need to substantially increase our revenues to become profitable. because of the risks and uncertainties associated with further developing and marketing the cardionet system, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.our business is dependent upon physicians prescribing our services; if we fail to obtain those prescriptions, our revenues could fail to grow and could decrease. the success of our business is dependent upon physicians prescribing our services for patients and cross-selling the respective cardionet and pdsheart customer bases. our success in obtaining prescriptions and cross-selling will be directly influenced by a number of factors, including: the ability of the physicians with whom we work to obtain sufficient reimbursement and be paid in a timely manner for the professional services they provide in connection with the use of our arrhythmia monitoring solutions, particularly the cardionet system; our ability to educate physicians regarding, and convince them of, the benefits of the cardionet system over existing treatment methods such as holter monitors and event monitors; and the perceived clinical efficacy of the cardionet system. if we are unable to educate physicians regarding the benefits of the cardionet system, obtain sufficient prescriptions and cross-sell our respective customer bases, revenues from the provision of our arrhythmia monitoring solutions could fail to grow and could decrease. we and the physicians with whom we work are dependent upon reimbursement for the fees associated with our services; the absence or inadequacy of reimbursement would cause our revenues to fail to grow or decrease. we receive reimbursement for our services from commercial payors and from medicare partb carriers where the services are performed on behalf of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, or cms. the medicare partb carriers in each state change from time to time, which may result in changes to our reimbursement rates, increased administrative burden and reimbursement delays. in addition, our prescribing physicians receive reimbursement for professional interpretation of the information provided by our products and services from commercial payors or medicare carriers within the state where they practice. the efficacy, safety, performance and cost-effectiveness of our products and services, on a stand-alone basis and relative to competing services, will determine the availability and level of reimbursement we and our prescribing physicians receive. our ability to successfully contract with payors is critical to our business because physicians and their patients will select arrhythmia monitoring solutions other than ours in the event that payors refuse to adequately reimburse our technical fees and physicians' professional fees. many commercial payors refuse to enter into contracts to reimburse the fees associated with medical devices or services that such payors determine to be "experimental and investigational." commercial payors typically label medical devices or services as "experimental and investigational" until such devices or services have demonstrated product superiority evidenced by a randomized clinical trial. we completed a clinical trial in which the cardionet system provided higher diagnostic yield than traditional loop event monitoring. prior to our clinical trial, the cardionet system was labeled "experimental and investigational" by 21 targeted commercial payors, representing approximately 95million covered lives. subsequent to our trial, three commercial payors, representing over 26million covered lives, removed the designation of the cardionet system as "experimental and investigational." several of the remaining payors, however, have informed us that they do not believe the data from this trial justifies the removal of this designation. other commercial payors may also find the data from our clinical trial not compelling. additional commercial payors may also label the cardionet system as "experimental and investigational" and, as a result, refuse to reimburse the technical and professional fees associated with the cardionet system. administration of the claims process for the many commercial payors is complex. as a result we sometimes bill payors for services for which we have no reimbursement contract. these payors may require that we return any funds that they pay in respect of these claims. if commercial payors or medicare decide not to reimburse our services or the related services provided by physicians, or the rates of such reimbursement change, or if we fail to properly administer claims, our revenues could fail to grow and could decrease.reimbursement by medicare is highly regulated and subject to change; our failure to comply with applicable regulations, could decrease our revenues and may subject us to penalties or have an adverse impact on our business. we receive approximately 30% of our revenues as reimbursement from medicare. the medicare program is administered by centers for medicare &medicaid services, or cms, which imposes extensive and detailed requirements on medical services providers, including, but not limited to, rules that govern how we structure our relationships with physicians, how and when we submit reimbursement claims, how we operate our monitoring facilities and how and where we provide our arrhythmia monitoring solutions. our failure to comply with applicable medicare rules could result in discontinuing our reimbursement under the medicare payment program, our being required to return funds already paid to us, civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare program. in addition, reimbursement from medicare is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, local and national coverage decisions, rate adjustments and administrative rulings, all of which could materially affect the range of services covered or the reimbursement rates paid by medicare for use of our arrhythmia monitoring solutions. for example, cms adopted a new payment policy in january2007 that reduced the rate of reimbursement for a number of services reimbursed by medicare. although this modification to medicare's reimbursement rates did not affect the amount paid by medicare for reimbursement of the fees associated with the cardionet system, it resulted in the reduction of reimbursement rates for event services by 3% to 8%, depending on the type of service, and holter services by 8% as compared to the corresponding rates in effect in 2006. based on current proposed medicare rates for 2008 through 2010, we expect that reimbursement for event and holter services will continue to decline at an annual rate similar to 2007. in addition, we cannot predict whether future modifications to medicare's reimbursement policies could reduce or eliminate the amounts we receive from medicare for the solutions we provide. in addition, medicare's reimbursement rates can affect the rate that commercial payors are willing to pay for our products and services. consequently, any future elimination, limitation or reduction in the reimbursement rates provided by medicare for our arrhythmia monitoring solutions could result in a reduction in the rates we receive from commercial payors.reimbursement for the cardionet system by medicare and other commercial payors is complicated by the lack of a specific current procedural terminology, or cpt, code, which may result in lower prescription rates or varying reimbursement rates. when we bill medicare and certain other commercial payors for the service we provide in connection with the cardionet system, we submit the bill using the nonspecific billing, or cpt, code "93799." unlike dedicated cpt codes approved by the american medical association, or ama, and cms, claims using non-specific codes may require semi-automated or manual processing, as well as additional review by payors. the claims processing requirements associated with a nonspecific code can make our services less attractive to physicians because added time and effort is often required in order to receive payment for their services. furthermore, the medicare reimbursement rate for non-specific codes is determined by local medicare carriers. as a result, the reimbursement rates relating to our cardionet system are subject to change without notice. a request to the ama for a specific cpt code that describes our cardionet system has been made. the request was discussed and voted upon by the cpt editorial panel at its public october 2007 meeting. the results of the vote are confidential. we have been informally advised that the cpt editorial panel voted in favor of the request. however, the results of the vote are subject to change until such results are published in the fall of 2008. if the request is officially approved by the ama cpt editorial panel, the specific cpt code would be published in the fall of 2008 and would be available for use in 2009. however, we cannot guarantee that we will receive a specific cpt code for the cardionet system in that timeframe, or ever. moreover, if we do receive a cpt code, the reimbursement rate associated with that code, which would be subject to change on an annual basis through a public notice and comment process, may be lower than our current reimbursement rates.a reduction in sales of our services or a loss of one or more of our key commercial payors would adversely affect our business and operating results. a small number of commercial payors represent a significant percentage of our revenues. in the year ended december31, 2007, our top 10 commercial payors by revenues accounted for approximately 29.9% of our total revenues. our agreements with these commercial payors typically allow either party to the contract to terminate the contract by providing between 60 and 120days prior written notice to the other party at any time following the end of the initial term of the contract. our commercial payors may elect to terminate or not to renew their contracts with us for any reason and, in some instances can unilaterally change the reimbursement rates they pay. in the event any of our key commercial payors terminate their agreements with us, elect not to renew their agreements with us or elect not to enter into new agreements with us upon expiration of their agreements with us on terms as favorable as our current agreements, our business, operating results and prospects would be adversely affected.consolidation of commercial payors could result in payors eliminating coverage of our cardionet system or reduced reimbursement rates for our cardionet system. the commercial payor industry is undergoing significant consolidation. when payors combine their operations, the combined company may elect to reimburse our cardionet system at the lowest rate paid by any of the participants in the consolidation. if one of the payors participating in the consolidation does not reimburse for the cardionet system at all, the combined company may elect not to reimburse for the cardionet system. our reimbursement rates tend to be lower for larger payors. as a result, as payors consolidate, our average reimbursement rate may decline.our acquisition of pdsheart, as well as any other companies or technologies we may acquire in the future, could prove difficult to integrate and may disrupt our business and harm our operating results and prospects. our acquisition of pdsheart involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not take advantage of the cross-selling opportunities brought about by the acquisition. in addition, our acquisition of pdsheart, as well as acquisitions in which we may engage in the future, involve risks associated with our assumption of the liabilities of an acquired company, which may be liabilities that we were or are unaware of at the time of the acquisition, potential write-offs of acquired assets and potential loss of the acquired company's key employees or customers. we may encounter difficulties in successfully integrating our operations, technologies, services and personnel with that of the acquired company, and our financial and management resources may be diverted from our existing operations. for example, following our acquisition of pdsheart we have offices in pennsylvania, california, florida, georgia and minnesota. our offices in multiple states creates a strain on our ability to effectively manage our operations and key personnel. if we elect to consolidate our facilities we may lose key personnel unwilling to relocate to the consolidated facility, may have difficulty hiring appropriate personnel at the consolidated facility and may have difficulty providing continuity of service through the consolidation. physician and patient satisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or device could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation. additionally, potential disputes with the seller of an acquired business or its employees, suppliers or customers and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the pdsheart acquisition or any other acquisition we may pursue or to profitably deploy acquired assets. if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions, our business may be disrupted and our operating results and prospects may be harmed.if we are unable to manage our expected growth, our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected. our business plans call for rapid expansion of our sales and marketing operations and growth of our research and development, product development and administrative operations. we had a sales force of 27 account executives at december31, 2006 and 76 account executives at december31, 2007. we intend to expand our sales force to 89 individuals by december31, 2008. we expect this expansion will place a significant strain on our management and operational and financial resources. our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our anticipated growth. to manage our growth we will be required to improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls and expand, train and manage our growing employee base. if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, revenue growth may not be realized or may not be sustainable, may not result in improved operating results or earnings, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. our business is dependent upon having sufficient monitors and sensors. if we do not have enough monitors or sensors or experience delays in manufacturing, we may be unable to fill prescriptions in a timely manner, physicians may elect not to prescribe the cardionet system, and our revenues and growth prospects could be harmed. when a physician prescribes the cardionet system to a patient, our customer service department begins the patient hook-up process, which includes procuring a monitor and sensors from our distribution department and sending them to the patient. while our goal is to provide each patient with a monitor and sensors in a timely manner, we have experienced and may in the future experience delays due to the availability of monitors, primarily when converting to a new generation of monitor or, more recently, in connection with the increase in prescriptions following our acquisition of pdsheart. we may also experience shortages of monitors or sensors due to manufacturing difficulties. multiple suppliers provide the components used in the cardionet system, but our facilities in san diego, california are registered and approved by the united states food and drug administration, or fda, as the ultimate manufacturer of the cardionet system. our manufacturing operations could be disrupted by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster, a work stoppage or other labor-related disruption, failure in supply or other logistical channels, electrical outages or other reasons. if there was a disruption to our facilities in san diego, we would be unable to manufacture the cardionet system until we have restored and re-qualified our manufacturing capability or developed alternative manufacturing facilities. our success in obtaining future prescriptions from physicians is dependent upon our ability to promptly deliver monitors and sensors to our patients, and a failure in this regard would have an adverse effect on our revenues and growth prospects.interruptions or delays in telecommunications systems or in the data services provided to us by qualcomm or the loss of our wireless or data services could impair the delivery of our cardionet system services. the success of the cardionet system is dependent upon our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage data and to maintain and upgrade our data processing and communication capabilities. the monitors we use in connection with the cardionet system rely on a third party wireless carrier to transmit data over its data network during times that the monitor is removed from its base. all data sent by our monitors via this wireless data network or via landline is routed directly to qualcomm data centers and subsequently routed to our monitoring center. we are dependent upon these third parties to provide data transmission and data hosting services to us. we do not have an agreement directly with this third party wireless carrier. although we do have an agreement with qualcomm that has an initial termination date in september 2010, qualcomm may terminate its agreement with us if certain conditions occur, including if qualcomm's agreement with the third party wireless carrier terminates or in the event we fail to maintain an agreed-upon number of active cardiac monitoring devices on the qualcomm network. we have no control over the status of the agreement between qualcomm and the wireless carrier. if we fail to maintain our relationships with qualcomm or if we lose wireless carrier services, we would be forced to seek alternative providers of data transmission and data hosting services, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. as we expand our commercial activities, an increased burden will be placed upon our data processing systems and the equipment upon which they rely. interruptions of our data networks or the data networks of qualcomm for any extended length of time, loss of stored data or other computer problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. frequent or persistent interruptions in our arrhythmia monitoring services could cause permanent harm to our reputation and could cause current or potential users of the cardionet system or prescribing physicians to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors. such interruptions could result in liability, claims and litigation against us for damages or injuries resulting from the disruption in service. our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, break-ins, sabotage, and acts of vandalism. despite any precautions that we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in these services. we do not carry business interruption insurance to protect against losses that may result from interruptions in service as a result of system failures. moreover, the communications and information technology industries are subject to rapid and significant changes, and our ability to operate and compete is dependent in significant part on our ability to update and enhance the communication technologies used in our systems and services.the market for arrhythmia monitoring solutions is highly competitive. if our competitors are able to develop or market monitoring solutions that are more effective, or gain greater acceptance in the marketplace, than any solutions we develop, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated. the market for arrhythmia monitoring solutions is evolving rapidly and becoming increasingly competitive. our industry is highly fragmented and characterized by a small number of large providers and a large number of smaller regional service providers. these third parties compete with us in marketing to payors and prescribing physicians, recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, acquiring technology and developing solutions complementary to our programs. in addition, as companies with substantially greater resources than ours enter our market, we will face increased competition. if our competitors are better able to develop and patent arrhythmia monitoring solutions than us, or develop more effective and/or less expensive arrhythmia monitoring solutions that render our solutions obsolete or non-competitive or deploy larger or more effective marketing and sales resources than ours, our business will be harmed and our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.if we need to raise additional funding in the future, we may be unable to raise such capital when needed, or at all, and the terms of such capital may be adverse to our stockholders. we believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future. however, our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: the costs associated with manufacturing and building our inventory of our next generation c3 monitor; the costs of hiring additional personnel and investing in infrastructure; the reimbursement rates associated with our products and services; actions taken by the fda, cms and other regulatory authorities affecting the cardionet system and competitive products; our ability to secure contracts with additional commercial payors providing for the reimbursement of our services; the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments; the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights or defending against claims of infringement by others; and the costs of investing in additional lines of business outside of arrhythmia monitoring solutions. if we need to, or choose to, raise additional capital in the future, such capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result. if we raise additional funds by incurring additional debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.our manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. if we or our suppliers fail to achieve or maintain regulatory approval of these manufacturing facilities, our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed. we currently manufacture the monitors and sensors for the cardionet system in san diego, california. monitors used in the provision of services by pdsheart are purchased from several third parties. in order to maintain compliance with fda and other regulatory requirements, our manufacturing facilities must be periodically re-evaluated and qualified under a quality system to ensure they meet production and quality standards. suppliers of components of and products used to manufacture the cardionet system and the manufacturers of the monitors used in the provision of services by pdsheart must also comply with fda and foreign regulatory requirements, which often require significant resources and subject us and our suppliers to potential regulatory inspections and stoppages. we or our suppliers may not satisfy these requirements. if we or our suppliers do not maintain regulatory approval for our manufacturing operations, our business would be harmed.our dependence on a limited number of suppliers may prevent us from delivering our devices on a timely basis. we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers of components for the cardionet system. if these suppliers became unable to provide components in the volumes needed or at an acceptable price, we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements from alternative sources of supply. qualifying suppliers is a lengthy process. delays or interruptions in the supply of our requirements could limit or stop our ability to provide sufficient quantities of devices on a timely basis, meet demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.we could be subject to medical liability or product liability claims which may not be covered by insurance and which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. the design, manufacture and marketing of services of the types we provide entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. any such claims against us may require us to incur significant defense costs, irrespective of whether such claims have merit. in addition, we provide information to health care providers and payors upon which determinations affecting medical care are made, and claims may be made against us resulting from adverse medical consequences to patients resulting from the information we provide. in addition, we may become subject to liability in the event that the monitors and sensors we use fail to correctly record or transfer patient information or if we provide incorrect information to patients or health care providers using our services. we have also agreed to indemnify qualcomm for any claims resulting from the provision of our services. if we incur one or more significant claims against us, if we are required to indemnify qualcomm as a result of the provision of our services, or if we are required to undertake remedial actions in response to any such claims, such claims or actions would adversely affect our business and results of operations. our liability insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. in addition, our current insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, the coverages may not be adequate to protect us against any future claims. if we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect against any claims against us, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. if we do not obtain and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property, the value of our technology and devices may be adversely affected. our business and competitive positions are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology. to protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, employment, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements and protective contractual provisions with other third parties. we attempt to protect our intellectual property position by filing trademark applications and u.s., foreign and international patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. as of december31, 2007, we had 14 issued u.s. patents, seven foreign patents and 42 pending u.s., foreign and international patent applications relating to various aspects of the cardionet system. as of december31, 2007, we also had 11 trademark registrations and one pending trademark application in the united states for a variety of word marks and slogans. we do not believe that any single patent, trademark or other intellectual property right of ours, or combination of our intellectual property rights, is likely to prevent others from competing with us using a similar business model. there are many issued patents and patent applications held by others in our industry and the electronics field. our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially similar or superior to our technologies, or design around our patents or other intellectual property to avoid infringement. in addition, we may not apply for a patent relating to products or processes that are patentable, we may fail to receive any patent for which we apply or have applied, and any patent owned by us or issued to us could be circumvented, challenged, invalidated, or held to be unenforceable, or rights granted thereunder may not adequately protect our technology or provide a competitive advantage to us. for example, with respect to one of our u.s. patents, we have a corresponding foreign patent, the claims of which were amended substantially more so than in the united states, to overcome art that was of record in the u.s. patent. if a third-party challenges the validity of any patents or proprietary rights of ours, we may become involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation that would be costly and time-consuming. although third parties may infringe our patents and other intellectual property rights, we may not be aware of any such infringement, or we may be aware of potential infringement but elect not to seek to prevent such infringement or pursue any claim of infringement, and the third party may continue its potentially infringing activities. we believe that lifewatchcorp. may be infringing our intellectual property rights and have filed a lawsuit against lifewatch, as is discussed in greater detail in "legal proceedings." any decision whether or not to take further action in response to the activities of lifewatch or any other potential infringement of our patent or other intellectual property rights may be based on any one or more of a variety of factors, such as the potential costs and benefits of taking such action, and business and legal issues and circumstances. litigation of claims of infringement of a patent or other intellectual property rights may be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of key company personnel, and may not be successful or result in any significant recovery of compensation for any infringement or enjoining of any infringing activity. litigation or licensing discussions may also involve or lead to counterclaims or proceedings that could be brought by a potential infringer to challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property. to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we generally require our e</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS An investment in the shares of Common Stock offered hereby is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information in this Prospectus, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in the shares of Common Stock offered hereby. Development Stage Company; History of Operating Losses; and Negative Cash Flow. Sylvan and MCI organized Caliber in November 1996. To date, Caliber has been engaged principally in development activities. The Company generated minimal revenues during 1997 and, therefore, has incurred operating losses and negative cash flow since inception. As of December 31, 1997, Caliber had accumulated losses of approximately $15.2 million, and the Company expects to continue to incur significant losses for at least the next two years. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability or generate positive cash flow. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."Significant Cash Requirements. The Company's continued development, construction, expansion and operation of its learning network will require substantial capital. The Company's ability to fund its planned expenditures and operations depends upon its ability to obtain sufficient equity and debt financing. The Company's initial capitalization consisted of $13.0 million in equity from Sylvan, MCI and the other initial stockholders. MCI agreed to provide $20.0 million, as needed, in lease financing or lease guarantees for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and Sylvan agreed to guarantee up to $3.0 million of the Company's debt or to provide up to a $3.0 million line of credit, at an interest rate of 1% above the NationsBank prime rate. As of December 31, 1997, $4.0 million of MCI's Lease and Guarantee Commitment had been used and all of the Sylvan Loan had been drawn. During 1997, the Company received $2.6 million in partial payment of the Sylvan Subscription. The Company expects to receive approximately $57.9 million in net proceeds from this offering and approximately $5.4 million from Sylvan's payment of the balance due on the Sylvan Subscription. Of these amounts, $3.3 million will be used to repay the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the Sylvan Loan, $2.9 million to repay deferred management fees to Sylvan and $1.2 million to pay accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. This will leave Caliber with approximately $55.9 million of net proceeds from this offering and payment of the balance of the Sylvan Subscription, $16.0 million of unused lease commitments from MCI, $3.0 million of available borrowings under the Sylvan Loan and $3.9 million of existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 1997. There can be no assurance that these cash resources following this offering will be sufficient to fund the Company's expected negative cash flow and its capital expenditures. The Company, therefore, may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financing necessary to satisfy its cash requirements or to implement its growth strategy successfully, in which event the Company will be forced to curtail its planned business expansion and may be unable to fund its ongoing operations. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."Technology and Technology Implementation Risks. The successful operation of the Caliber network requires the development of sophisticated software and the integration of a number of diverse communications technologies. To date, Caliber has only tested the software and the network under simulated operating conditions and operated the network under actual operating conditions on a limited basis. The ability of the network to function as intended at multiple sites simultaneously cannot be confirmed until a significant volume of actual programs are regularly delivered over the Caliber network. Technical difficulties may prevent or delay the Company's offering of educational programs, which is likely to have a material adverse effect on market acceptance of the network for distance learning. See "Business--Caliber Technology."Risk of Non-Acceptance of Caliber Learning Concept. Use of the Caliber Campuses will require a significant change in the way universities, corporations and working adults experience graduate level learning and professional training. Prominent universities may be unwilling to accept the Caliber network as an appropriate way to provide quality education, and faculty members may be unwilling to use the Caliber network 7 to teach. Corporations and students may not accept the Caliber network as an alternative to traditional classroom instruction. If the Caliber network fails to gain this acceptance, it is unlikely that Caliber will ever become a viable business. See "Business--The Caliber Network."Rapid Expansion of Operations. The Company plans to expand its business rapidly. The Company currently has 34 Caliber Campuses open and expects to have 41 Caliber Campuses open in 40 markets by September 1998. There can be no assurance that all 41 Caliber Campuses will be opened on schedule. The Company's ability to manage its rapid expansion effectively will require it to develop effective operating, financial and accounting systems and to add and retain qualified personnel at each Caliber Campus and at the corporate level. Failure to develop financial controls and accounting and reporting systems or add and retain personnel that adequately support the Company's growth will materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business--Employees" and "Management."Reliance on Sylvan Management and Systems. Currently, the Company relies extensively on Sylvan's resources, systems and personnel for management, administrative, legal, accounting and financial functions. The Company also uses office space leased by Sylvan. Sylvan has agreed to provide payroll, legal, accounting and other services and lease space only through 1999 for a fee of $2.0 million in each of 1998 and 1999 and is not obligated to continue to do so thereafter. During the next two years, the Company will be required to develop its own systems to replace those currently provided by Sylvan and to add and integrate a substantial number of new managerial, finance, accounting and support personnel. Failure to develop these systems or add and retain personnel to manage the Company's business effectively would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and growth. See "Business-- Employees," "Management" and "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions-- Sylvan Management Agreement."Dependence on Skilled Personnel. The ability to provide distance learning services as contemplated by the Company will require the services of skilled technicians and educational facilitators. In addition, the Company will need additional marketing and sales personnel to support planned growth. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in adding or retaining the necessary personnel. Failure to do so is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and growth. See "Business--Marketing and Sales" and--"Employees."Dependence on Strategic Partners. The Company's success will depend upon establishing and maintaining strategic alliances with prominent universities and corporations to provide high quality educational and training programs. However, to date, only Johns Hopkins, Wharton, Compaq, Macmillan and MCI Systemhouse have agreed to provide programs through the Caliber network, with Johns Hopkins and Wharton each agreeing to deliver only a single program. Many of these contracts are terminable if Caliber fails to achieve stated performance objectives contained in these contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining and expanding these existing relationships or that it will be able to establish and maintain new strategic relationships with other prominent universities or corporations. If the initial programs are unsuccessful, if these universities and corporations do not expand their offerings through the Caliber network or if Caliber is unable to enter into other strategic relationships, it is unlikely that Caliber will become a viable business. See "Business--Strategy."Untested Business Plan. The Company made numerous assumptions in developing its business plan, such as the number of students expected to enroll in a given program, the prices the Company will be able to charge for programs, the rate at which additional programs will be added to the Caliber network and the cost of operating Caliber Campuses. The assumptions underlying Caliber's business plan may prove to be too optimistic, and the Company may encounter delays in achieving the objectives in its business plan. This is likely to result in lower than planned revenues, higher than expected expenses and sustained unprofitability. The Company can give no assurance that it will be able to adjust its operations and business plan. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 8Significant Regulation. Many of the states in which Caliber intends to operate Caliber Campuses require that any entity providing educational programs obtain a license to operate. Since Caliber's distance learning concept is novel and state authorities may not have substantial experience with arrangements of this type, the Company cannot predict with certainty whether states will grant the licenses necessary to offer educational programs at all Caliber Campuses. Certain states accept accreditation as evidence of meeting minimum state standards for a license, and other states apply separate standards. Accreditation organizations may require prior approval and periodic monitoring of distance learning programs. Caliber expects that each university offering courses through the Caliber network will be required to obtain the necessary license, possibly one for each program offered, in each state where a Caliber Campus is located. If the Company or the universities are unable to obtain the necessary licenses or accreditations or if the licenses or accreditations are delayed or revoked, Caliber's business and growth may be materially adversely affected.Congress is expected to consider reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended ("HEA"), in 1998. Treatment of distance learning is expected to be a major topic in the reauthorization process. There can be no assurance that the HEA will not be amended to impose stricter or additional requirements which would affect the Company. In addition, state and federal regulation of distance learning programs, as well as private accreditation of such programs, are undergoing significant review by the U.S. Department of Education, state regulators and accreditation organizations. Caliber cannot predict the scope or the outcome of this review, but additional regulation of distance learning may result from this review. This additional regulation may adversely affect the way Caliber intends to deliver educational content over its network. See "Business--Government Regulation."Rapid Technological Change. The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and the Company's future success will depend on its ability to implement technological advances. Caliber anticipates that if interactive distance learning becomes accepted as an effective means of providing educational and training programs, the industry will evolve rapidly. To remain competitive, Caliber must be able to respond quickly to evolving industry trends, technological advances and changes in client needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in adapting to these trends, advances or changes. In addition, technologies developed by competitors may significantly reduce demand for the Company's services or render the Company's services obsolete. See "Business--Caliber Technology."Competition. Competition among providers of lifelong learning and professional training is intense. Management believes that its principal potential competitors will be prominent universities located in the markets served by Caliber Campuses. In each of Caliber's markets, there are also other two-year and four-year colleges which have their own continuing education and graduate level programs. Each of these competitors offers live classroom instruction and has an established reputation in the educational field and, therefore, may enjoy a competitive advantage. In addition, two-year and four- year higher education institutions, particularly public institutions, are offering distance education courses, and several distance education initiatives are currently underway among public higher education institutions. Other competitors include for-profit educational organizations, such as the Apollo Group's University of Phoenix, Strayer University and DeVry's Keller School of Management, that provide lifelong learning programs targeted to working adults and feature live classroom instruction. Caliber may also compete with distance learning companies that offer self-paced correspondence courses, videos, audiocassettes and other distance learning products. More recent distance learning products include CD-rom and Internet-based instruction. If the Caliber distance learning concept proves successful, Caliber expects competitors to enter the market. For example, businesses that have facilities in multiple markets that could be linked by satellite, such as major hotel and movie theater chains, could decide to establish networks of distance learning facilities to compete with Caliber. Westcott Communications, Inc., which has established a one-way satellite-based network currently used by a number of larger corporations to distribute their training programs, could decide to make its network interactive. The Company also competes against a significant number of third party training companies that provide various training programs to corporations. In addition, corporations may continue to use internal resources to satisfy their training needs. See "Business--Competition." 9Limited Protection of Proprietary Expertise and Methodologies. The Company's success will be highly dependent upon its specialized and proprietary expertise, methodologies and software. The Company must rely on a combination of trade secret laws, employee nondisclosure policies and third-party confidentiality agreements. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such rights or that third parties will not independently develop functionally equivalent or superior methodologies or software. There also can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company relative to the Company's methodologies, which could result in costly litigation or the need to establish license arrangements. The Company intends to seek a patent on certain design features of its network. However, there can be no assurance this patent will be granted or, if granted, that it will cover all the proprietary features of the network. See "Business--Proprietary Rights."Dependence on Management. The Company is highly dependent on the members of its senior management, particularly Messrs. Nguyen, Frier, Dobkin, Polivka, Locher and Peterson, the loss of any of whose services may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of critical development, marketing and other business objectives. If the Company's business expands, attracting and retaining additional qualified management personnel will be critical to the Company's success. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to expand its business. The Company does not have employment contracts with senior management. The Company is in the process of obtaining a $3 million "key man" insurance policy on Mr. Nguyen's life. See "Management."Control by Existing Stockholders. Upon completion of this offering, MCI, Sylvan, Mr. Hoehn-Saric and Mr. Becker will beneficially own 1,242,513, 1,227,393, 1,718,351 and 1,718,351 shares of Common Stock, respectively, and Sylvan will own 5,167,328 shares of 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, which is convertible at any time after the second anniversary of this offering into an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, MCI, Sylvan and Messrs. Hoehn-Saric and Becker together will control approximately 49.1% of the Common Stock (or 66.7% if Sylvan were to convert all of its shares of 6% Non-Voting Preferred Stock to Common Stock and MCI were to exercise the MCI warrant). This is likely to be sufficient to enable them to effectively control the outcome of any matter submitted to the stockholders, assuming they choose to vote their shares together. See "Principal and Selling Stockholders" and "Description of Capital Stock."Substantial Proceeds of Offering Payable to Sylvan and MCI. Of the net proceeds of this offering, the Company will use $3.3 million to pay accrued interest and principal on the Sylvan Loan, $1.2 million to pay MCI accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and $2.9 million to pay accrued management fees due to Sylvan. As a result, a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering will not be available to the Company to fund its operations and planned growth. See "Use of Proceeds."Potential Conflicts of Interest. Conflicts of interest may arise between the Company, Sylvan and MCI in a number of areas relating to their ongoing or future relationships. There are no non-competition agreements between Caliber and either Sylvan or MCI. Sylvan currently provides substantial management and administrative services to Caliber but is not obligated to continue to do so after 1999. MCI has agreed to provide $20.0 million of lease financing to Caliber, as needed, and provides various ongoing telecommunications services to Caliber. Caliber may enter into additional material transactions and agreements with Sylvan and MCI in the future. MCI, Sylvan and Sterling Caliber have the right to require that their shares of Caliber Common Stock be registered for sale under the Securities Act at various times over the next four years and may decide to sell their shares in the public market at any time. Directors of the Company who are also directors or employees of Sylvan or MCI may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting the Company, such as financing, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities. There can be no assurance that these or any other conflicts of interest will be resolved in favor of the Company. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."Shares Eligible for Future Sale. Upon completion of this offering, the Company will have outstanding 12,018,642 shares of Common Stock, plus 1,162,895 shares issuable upon exercise of currently outstanding options, 1,193,573 shares issuable upon exercise of the MCI Warrant and 5,167,328 shares issuable upon 10 conversion by Sylvan of the 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock. The 5,700,000 shares offered hereby will be freely transferable unless acquired by affiliates of the Company. All of the remaining outstanding shares, upon expiration of the Underwriters' lock-up described below, will be saleable under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, unless then held by affiliates of the Company. The 1,162,895 shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options and the 985,133 shares reserved for future grants under the Company's 1998 Plan will be registered under the Securities Act upon completion of this offering. Those shares will be freely transferable upon issuance unless held by affiliates of the Company. The Company has granted MCI, Sylvan and Sterling Caliber, who hold an aggregate of 7,100,181 shares of Common Stock (assuming exercise of the MCI Warrant) shares of Common Stock and 5,167,328 shares of 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, the right to have their shares of Common Stock registered under the Securities Act on one or more occasions over the next four years. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale."Sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock following this offering, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the Common Stock and could impair the Company's ability to raise capital through an offering of its equity securities. All of the Company's officers and employees who own Common Stock, or hold options to purchase 7,500 shares or more, have agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any of their shares for a period of two years after the date of this Prospectus without the prior written consent of both BT Alex. Brown Incorporated and the Company. Sylvan, MCI and Sterling Caliber, who will hold in the aggregate 7,100,181 shares of Common Stock and 5,167,328 shares of 6% Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock upon completion of this offering, have agreed not to sell or dispose of any of their shares for a period of one year after the date of this Prospectus without the prior written consent of BT Alex. Brown Incorporated. See "Underwriting."No Prior Market for Common Stock; Possible Volatility of Stock Price. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock, and there can be no assurance that an active public market for the Common Stock will develop or be sustained after the offering. The initial public offering price was determined by negotiations among the Company and the Representatives of the Underwriters and may not be indicative of market prices of the Common Stock after this offering. See "Underwriting." The market price of the Common Stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in Caliber's quarterly operating results and other events or factors, such as Caliber's announcement of new strategic alliances with prominent universities or corporations, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and announcements by other companies in the lifelong learning industry. Moreover, the stock market and the market prices of the shares of many emerging growth companies in recent years have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific company. Broad stock market fluctuations, as well as economic conditions generally, may adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. There can be no assurance that the market price of the Common Stock will not decline below the initial public offering price.Certain Anti-takeover Provisions. Certain provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Charter") and Maryland law may have the effect of discouraging a change of control of the Company or deterring tender offers for the Common Stock. The Charter grants to the Board of Directors authority to issue shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which the holders of some of the shares of Common Stock might receive a premium over the then-prevailing market price of the Common Stock. The Charter also divides the Board of Directors into three classes of Directors who will serve for staggered terms, which may have the effect of inhibiting or delaying a change of control of the Company. A Director may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. See "Description of Capital Stock--Anti- takeover Provisions of Charter and By-Laws."The Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL") prohibits certain business combinations between a Maryland corporation and any person who owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's capital stock (an "Interested Stockholder") or an affiliate thereof for a period of five years after the most recent date on which the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder and imposes additional requirements on the approval and terms of the transaction. The MGCL also provides that shares acquired by a stockholder which 11</td>

Prospective investors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as other information included in this Prospectus, before making an investment decision concerning the Common Stock This Prospectus contains certain "forward-looking statements" which represent the Company's expectations or beliefs, including, but not limited to, statements concerning industry performance and the Company's operations, performance, financial condition, prospects, growth and strategies. For this purpose, any statements contained in this Prospectus except for historical information may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "could," "estimate," or "continue" or the negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond the Company's control, and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors, including those described below in this "Risk Factors" section and elsewhere in this Prospectus. LIMITED HISTORY OF OPERATIONS LIMITS PRIOR PERFORMANCE AS AN INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCEThe Company commenced operations in August 1995 and began originating loans in October 1995. Although the Company has been profitable for each fiscal period presented herein and has experienced substantial growth in mortgage loan originations and total revenues, there can be no assurance that the Company will be profitable in the future or that these rates of growth will be sustainable or indicative of future results. Any decline in future profitability or growth rates may adversely affect the market for the Company's Common Stock which could result in volatility or a decline in its market priceSince it commenced operations in August 1995, the Company's growth in originating loans has been significant. In light of this growth, the historical financial performance of the Company may be of limited relevance in predicting future performance. Since the Company historically has sold substantially all loans originated on a whole loan basis, it has not tracked the performance of its loans in the secondary market and thus is unable to determine the history of loan losses associated with such loans. If a material portion of such loans result in loan losses to the holders thereof, the market for and pricing of the Company's loans could be adversely affected, which could materially lower revenues for a subject reporting period. NO ASSURANCE OF PLANNED GROWTH; INABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO GROW COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTSThe Company's total revenues and net income have grown significantly since inception, primarily due to increased mortgage loan origination and sales activities. The Company intends to continue to pursue a growth strategy for the foreseeable future. Since the Company expects recent higher levels of mortgage broker compensation, which reduce the cash gain on sale of mortgage loans, to continue for the three months ending March 31, 1998 and possibly thereafter, the Company believes that its future operating results will depend largely upon its ability to expand its mortgage origination and sales activities, and, in particular, increased penetration in existing markets. While the Company plans to continue its growth of loan originations through the expansion of its Wholesale Division and Retail Division, these plans require additional personnel and assets. To date, the Company has had a relative lack of experience in retail originations, having only originated $14.5 million through its Retail Division from the inception of the division in March 1996 through December 31, 1997. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully expand and operate such divisions and programs profitably. It also is expected that such expansion plans will result in a substantial increase in operating expenses in the short-run. Furthermore, since management expects that there will be a time lag between the expenditure of such monies and the receipt of any revenues from such expansion efforts, the Company's results of operations may be adversely affected in the short- run. There can be no assurance that the Company will anticipate and respond effectively to all of the changing demands that its expanding operations will have on the Company's management, information and operating systems, and the failure to adapt its systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully achieve its planned expansion or, if achieved, that the expansion will result in profitable operations. 8 RISK OF VARIATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTSSeveral factors affecting the Company's business can cause significant variations in its quarterly results of operations. In particular, variations in the volume of the Company's loan originations, the differences between the Company's costs of funds and the average interest rates of originated loans, the inability of the Company to complete significant loan sales transactions in a particular quarter, and problems generally affecting the mortgage loan industry can result in significant increases or decreases in the Company's revenues from quarter to quarter. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Quarterly Data." A delay in closing a particular loan sale transaction during a particular quarter would postpone recognition of cash gain on sale of loans. In addition, delays in closing a particular loan sale transaction would also increase the Company's exposure to interest rate fluctuations by lengthening the period during which its variable rate borrowings under its warehouse facilities are outstanding. If the Company were unable to sell a sufficient number of its loans at a premium in a particular reporting period, the Company's revenues for such period would decline, resulting in lower net income and possibly a net loss for such period, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." DISCONTINUANCE OF EXCLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH DLJ COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTSThe Company commenced operations in August 1995 and prior to this Offering, has benefitted from its relationship with DLJ, which owned approximately 44% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock as of December 31, 1997. Since commencement of operations, DLJ has provided the Company with a $50.0 million warehouse line of credit to fund loan production (the "DLJ Facility"), which has been the only financing facility the Company has used to date. The interest rate under the DLJ Facility was equal to the federal funds rate plus 100 basis points, subject to increase based on the length of time loans are held by the Company. The Company is substantially dependent upon its access to warehouse lines of credit and other lending facilities in order to fund loan originationsIn October 1997, the Company and DLJ agreed to amend the terms of the DLJ Facility (the "Amended DLJ Facility") to increase the amount of the DLJ Facility to $150.0 million and modified the term of the DLJ Facility to two years after the closing of this Offering. The interest rate of the DLJ Facility will remain effective until the closing of this Offering; thereafter, borrowings under the Amended DLJ Facility during the first 12 months will bear interest at the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points and thereafter the rate will be the federal funds rate plus 100 basis points. See "Business-- Financing and Sale of Loans." It is expected that the Amended DLJ Facility will not be extended beyond the modified term. The Company is seeking to obtain additional and alternative sources of financing on favorable terms to decrease its reliance on DLJ. While the Company is currently negotiating with other lenders to obtain additional warehouse lines of credit, the Company currently has no financing commitment for such lines of credit. Any failure by DLJ to continue to provide financing under the Amended DLJ Facility or the Company's failure to obtain adequate funding under any additional or alternative facilities, on favorable terms or otherwise, could cause the Company to curtail loan origination activities, which would result in a decline in revenues, the effect of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operationsIn addition, under the Company's master loan purchase agreement and commitment letter thereto with DLJ (the "Master Loan Purchase Agreement"), since the Company commenced business, DLJ has purchased substantially all of the Company's loan production through whole loan sales. For a more detailed discussion of the terms of the Master Loan Purchase Agreement, see "Arrangements with DLJ and the Recapitalization." Gain on sales of loans represents the primary source of the Company's revenues and net income. The Company relies almost entirely on proceeds from loan sales to generate cash for repayment of borrowings under the Company's warehouse facilities. There can be no assurance that DLJ will continue to purchase loans originated by the Company or will be willing to purchase such loans on terms under which it had historically purchased the Company's loans. Following the completion of this Offering, the Company intends to sell loan production to DLJ and other institutional purchasers in the secondary market. While the Company has historically assisted DLJ in identifying purchasers of those loans purchased by DLJ 9 under the Master Loan Purchase Agreement (see "Business--Financing and Sale of Loans--Loan Sales"), there can be no assurance that the Company would be successful in identifying other institutional purchasers or in negotiating favorable terms for such loan sales. The failure by the Company to timely sell its loans would expose the Company to interest rate fluctuations and greater risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, fraud losses and special hazard losses. The failure of the Company to negotiate favorable terms for its loan sales would adversely affect the Company's revenues. SUBSTANTIAL DEPENDENCE ON WHOLESALE BROKERSThe Company depends largely on independent mortgage brokers, financial institutions and mortgage bankers for its originations of mortgage loans. Substantially all of the independent mortgage brokers with whom the Company does business deal with multiple loan originators for each prospective borrower. Non-conforming originators, including the Company, compete for business based upon pricing, service, loan fees and costs and other factors. The Company's competitors also seek to establish relationships with such independent mortgage brokers, financial institutions and mortgage bankers, none of whom is contractually obligated to continue to do business with the Company. In addition, the Company expects the volume of wholesale loans that it originates to increase which will depend in large part on maintaining and expanding its relationships with its independent mortgage brokers. The Company's future results may become increasingly exposed to fluctuations in the volume and cost of its wholesale loans resulting from competition from other originators and purchasers of such loans, market conditions and other factors. SUBSTANTIAL RISKS RELATED TO LENDING TO LOWER CREDIT GRADE BORROWERSThe Company is a lender in the non-conforming mortgage banking industry, which means that the Company focuses its marketing efforts on borrowers who may be unable to obtain mortgage financing from conventional mortgage sources. Specifically, the Company makes "sub-prime" loans to persons with a Company risk classification of "B," "C+," "C" or "C-." Approximately 3.9% of the total principal amount of loans originated by the Company during each of the six months ended December 31, 1997 and the year ended June 30, 1997 were to borrowers with a Company risk classification of "C-," which includes borrowers with numerous derogatory credit items up to and including a bankruptcy in the most recent 12 month period. In addition, for the six months ended December 31, 1997 and the year ended June 30, 1997, approximately 50.9% and 48.8%, respectively, of the Company's total loan originations were made under its "Stated Income Documentation" program pursuant to which the Company does not require any income documentation. As a result, the Company does not independently verify in writing the accuracy of the stated income of such borrowers on their mortgage loan applications which may subject the Company to a greater risk of borrower misrepresentations. Also, an undeterminable percentage of the Company's loans are made based on exceptions to the Company's underwriting guidelines; any exception may cause a borrower to be placed in a more favorable borrower risk classification and thereby be provided loan terms which such borrower may not have qualified for absent such exception. Loans made to such non-conforming borrowers generally entail a higher risk of delinquency and higher losses than loans made to borrowers who utilize conventional mortgage sources. Delinquencies, foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Further, any material decline in real estate values increase the loan-to-value ratios of loans previously made by the Company, thereby weakening collateral coverage and increasing the possibility of a loss in the event of a borrower default. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses after the loans are sold could adversely affect the pricing of the Company's future loan sales and the ability of the Company to sell its loans in the future. In the past, certain of these factors have caused revenues and net income of many participants in the non-conforming mortgage industry, including the Company, to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. See "Business--Underwriting." SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ORIGINATE, SELL OR FINANCE MORTGAGE LOANSAs an originator of non-conforming mortgage loans, the Company faces intense competition, primarily from mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, credit unions, thrift institutions and finance companies. Many of these entities are substantially larger and have more capital and other resources than the Company. With respect to other mortgage banking and specialty finance companies, there are many larger companies that focus on the same types of non-conforming mortgage loans with which the Company directly competes for product. From time to time, one or more of these companies may be dominant in the origination and sale of non-conforming mortgage loans. 10 Competition can take many forms, including convenience in obtaining a loan, customer service, marketing distribution channels and loan pricing. If the Company is unable to remain competitive in these areas, the volume of the Company's loan originations may be materially adversely affected as borrowers seek out other lenders for their financing needs. Lower originations may have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to negotiate and obtain sufficient financing under warehouse lines of credit upon acceptable terms. Furthermore, the current level of gains realized by the Company and its competitors on the sale of the type of loans they originate and purchase is attracting and may continue to attract additional competitors into this market with the possible effect of lowering gains that may be realized on the Company's loan sales. Establishing a broker-sourced loan business typically requires a substantially smaller commitment of capital and personnel resources than a direct-sourced loan business. This relatively low barrier to entry permits new competitors to enter the broker-sourced loan market quickly, particularly existing direct- sourced lenders which can draw upon existing branch networks and personnel in seeking to sell products through independent brokers. Competition may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates and general economic conditions. During periods of rising rates, competitors which have locked in low borrowing costs may have a competitive advantage. See "Business--Competition."Increased competition could have the possible effects of (i) lowering gains that may be realized on the Company's loan sales, (ii) reducing the volume of the Company's loan originations and loan sales, (iii) increasing the demand for the Company's experienced personnel and the potential that such personnel will be recruited by the Company's competitors and (iv) lowering the industry standard for non-conforming underwriting guidelines (i.e., providing for higher loan-to-value ratios) as competitors attempt to increase or maintain market share in the face of increased competition. In the past, certain of these factors have caused revenues and net income of many participants in the non-conforming mortgage industry, including the Company, to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. See "--Risk of Variations in Quarterly Operating Results."There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the markets it serves. Inability to compete successfully would have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. RISK OF COMPETITION IN NEW MARKETS As the Company expands into new geographic markets, it may face competition from lenders with established positions in these locations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully compete with such established lenders, the effect of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. RISK OF COMPETITION FROM GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIESIn the future, the Company may also face competition from, among others, government-sponsored entities which may enter the non-conforming mortgage market. Existing or new loan purchase programs may be expanded by the Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA"), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC"), or the Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA") to include non-conforming mortgages, particularly those in the "A-" category, which constitute a significant portion of the Company's loan production. For example, the FHLMC has announced that it is entering the non- conforming market in 1998. Entries of such government-sponsored entities into the non-conforming market may have an adverse effect on loan yields on mortgage loans originated by the Company and reduce or eliminate premiums on loan sales. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT COMPANY OPERATIONSThe Company's business may be adversely affected by periods of economic slowdown or recession which may be accompanied by decreased demand for consumer credit and declining real estate values. Any material decline in real estate values reduces the ability of borrowers to use home equity to support borrowings and increases the loan-to-value ratios of loans previously made by the Company, thereby weakening collateral coverage and increasing the possibility of a loss in the event of default. To the extent that the loan-to- value ratios of prospective borrowers' home equity collateral do not meet the Company's underwriting criteria, the volume of loans originated by the Company 11 could decline. Further, delinquencies, foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of the Company's focus on borrowers who are unable or unwilling to obtain mortgage financing from conventional mortgage sources, whether for reasons of credit impairment, income qualification or credit history or a desire to receive funding on an expedited basis, the actual rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on such loans could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those currently experienced in the mortgage lending industry in general. Any sustained period of such increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect the pricing of the Company's loan sales whether through whole loan sales or future securitizations. A decline in loan origination volumes could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations and financial condition. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT NET INCOME AND PROFITABILITYProfitability may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates which affect the Company's ability to earn a spread between interest received on its loans held for sale and rates paid on warehouse lines. The Company's profitability may be adversely affected during any period of unexpected or rapid change in interest rates due to the fact that the Company does not currently hedge its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale. A substantial and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect the Company's ability to originate loans. Also, a significant decline in interest rates could increase the level of loan prepayments and require the Company to write down the value of the interest-only and residual certificates retained in any future securitizations, thereby adversely impacting earningsAdjustable-rate mortgage loans originated by the Company amounted to $48.9 million, $110.9 million and $96.9 million in principal amount during the six months ended December 31, 1997 and the years ended June 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Substantially all such adjustable-rate mortgage loans included a "teaser" rate, i.e., an initial interest rate significantly below the fully indexed interest rate at origination. Although these loans are underwritten at 1.0% above the initial or start rate at origination, borrowers may encounter financial difficulties as a result of increases in the interest rate over the life of the loan, which may adversely impact the performance of the Company's loans in the secondary market. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses after the loans are sold could adversely affect the pricing of the Company's future loan sales and the ability of the Company to sell its loans in the future. ELIMINATION OF LENDER PAYMENTS TO BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLawsuits have been filed against several mortgage lenders, not including the Company, alleging that such lenders have made certain payments to independent mortgage brokers in violation of the Federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, as amended ("RESPA"). These lawsuits have generally been filed on behalf of a purported nationwide class of borrowers alleging that payments made by a lender to a broker in addition to payments made by the borrower to a broker are prohibited by RESPA and are therefore illegal. If these cases are resolved against the lenders, it may cause an industry-wide change in the way independent mortgage brokers are compensated. The Company's broker compensation programs permit such payments. The Company makes such payments in the ordinary course of business. Due to competitive conditions, these payments have increased in recent periods, which adversely affected the Company's cash gain on sale of mortgage loans for the six months ended December 31, 1997. Management expects this increased level of payments to continue for the three months ending March 31, 1998 and possibly thereafter. Although the Company believes that its broker compensation programs comply with all applicable laws and are consistent with long-standing industry practice and regulatory interpretations, in the future new regulatory interpretations or judicial decisions may require the Company to change its broker compensation practices. Such a change may have a material adverse effect on the Company and the entire mortgage lending industry. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECT OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN LOAN SALESLoan sales are made to DLJ on a non-recourse basis pursuant to the Master Loan Purchase Agreement containing customary representations and warranties by the Company regarding the underwriting criteria and the origination process. The Company is required to provide similar representations and warranties to those 12 institutional purchasers to whom DLJ sells the subject loans. The Company, therefore, may be required to repurchase or substitute loans in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty to DLJ or the institutional purchaser, any misrepresentation during the mortgage loan origination process or, in some cases, upon any fraud or first payment default on such mortgage loans. In an environment of rapid whole loan sales, the Company may not have substitute loans which are not previously committed for sale readily available in which case the Company would be required to effect a repurchase. During the year ended June 30, 1997, the Company repurchased $178,000 of loans; no loans were repurchased during the six months ended December 31, 1997 and the year ended June 30, 1996. There can be no assurance that such repurchase levels will not substantially increase in future periods. Any claims asserted against the Company in the future by its loan purchasers may result in liabilities or legal expenses that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any material repurchase or substitution of loans may have an adverse effect on the market for and pricing of the Company's loans. DEPENDENCE ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF KEY PERSONNELThe Company's growth and development to date have been largely dependent upon the services of Evan R. Buckley, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and Kelly W. Monahan, the Company's President and Chief Financial Officer. The loss of Messrs. Buckley's or Monahan's services for any reason could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company does not maintain key person life insurance on the lives of any of its employees. In addition, the Company's future success will require it to recruit additional key personnel, including additional sales and marketing personnel. The Company believes that its future success also substantially depends on its ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees, who are in great demand. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in doing so. SUBSTANTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURE SECURITIZATIONSThe Company may in the future sell loans through securitizations which involve substantial risks, including the following: INABILITY TO SECURITIZE MORTGAGE LOANS. The Company anticipates that it may in the future acquire and accumulate mortgage loans until a sufficient quantity has been acquired for securitization. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in securitizing mortgage loans. During the accumulation period, the Company will be subject to risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, fraud losses and special hazard losses. In the event of any default under mortgage loans held by the Company, the Company will bear the risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the mortgage collateral and the principal amount of the mortgage loan. Also during the accumulation period, the costs of financing the mortgage loans through warehouse lines of credit or reverse repurchase agreements could exceed the interest income on the mortgage loans. It may not be possible or economical for the Company to complete the securitization of all mortgage loans that it acquires, in which case the Company will continue to hold the mortgage loans and bear the risks of borrower defaults and special hazard lossesPOTENTIAL RECOURSE AGAINST COMPANY IN SECURITIZATIONS. To the extent that the Company engages in securitizations, the Company intends to transfer loans originated by the Company to a trust in exchange for cash, "interest-only" and residual certificates issued by the trust. The trustee will have recourse to the Company with respect to the breach of standard representations or warranties made by the Company at the time such loans are transferred, the effect of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial conditionVALUE OF INTEREST-ONLY, PRINCIPAL-ONLY, RESIDUAL INTEREST AND SUBORDINATED SECURITIES SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION. To the extent that the Company engages in securitizations, the Company's assets will likely include "interest-only," "principal-only," residual interest and subordinated securities, which will be valued by the Company in accordance with SFAS No. 125, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities." The Company will record its retained interest in securitizations (including 13 "interest-only," "principal-only" and subordinated securities) as investments classified as trading securities. Realization of these "interest-only," "principal-only," residual interest and subordinated securities in cash is subject to the timing and ultimate realization of cash flows associated therewith, which is in turn effected by the prepayment and loss characteristics of the underlying loans. The Company will estimate future cash flows from these "interest-only," "principal-only," residual interest and subordinated securities and will value such securities with assumptions that it believes to be consistent with those that would be utilized by an unaffiliated third-party purchaser. If actual experience differs from the assumptions used in the determination of the asset value, future cash flows and earnings could be negatively impacted, and the Company could be required to reduce the value of its "interest-only," "principal-only," residual interest and subordinated securities in accordance with SFAS 125. The value of such securities can fluctuate widely and may be extremely sensitive to changes in discount rates, projected mortgage loan prepayments and loss assumptionsRISKS REGARDING HEDGING. In the future the Company may hedge its variable- rate mortgage loans and any interest-only and residual certificates retained in connection with any future securitizations with hedging transactions which may include forward sales of mortgage loans or mortgage-backed securities, interest rate caps and floors and buying and selling of futures and options on futures. Hedging techniques involving the use of derivative financial investments are highly complex and may prove volatile. The financial futures contracts and options thereon in which the Company may invest are subject to periodic margin calls that would result in additional costs to the Company. If a hedging instrument utilized by the Company were found to be legally unenforceable, the Company's portfolio of loans held for sale would be exposed to interest rate fluctuations which could materially and adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations. Additionally, hedging strategies have significant transaction costs. The nature and quantity of hedging transactions will be determined by the Company's management based on various factors, including market conditions and the expected volume of mortgage loan originations and purchases. No assurance can be given that such hedging transactions will offset the risks of changes in interest rates, and it is possible that there will be periods during which the Company could incur losses after accounting for its hedging activities. COMPANY PERFORMANCE MAY BE AFFECTED BY CONTRACTED SUB-SERVICINGWhile the Company currently sells substantially all of the mortgage loans it originates servicing released, it is required to service the loans from the date of funding through the date of sale. Since the Company conducts whole loan sales monthly, the Company currently does not have a substantial servicing portfolio. Nonetheless, the Company currently contracts for the sub- servicing of all mortgage loans it originates through the date of sale and is subject to risks associated with inadequate or untimely services. To the extent that the Company decides to retain servicing rights in the future or conduct securitizations, it currently intends to contract for the sub- servicing of such mortgage loans, which would expose it to more substantial risks ass</td>

You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In such event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. References to "strategic partners" or "strategic relationships" are not intended to necessarily imply any equity ownership in us by such entities. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY THE TECHNOLOGY USED IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS RAPIDLY CHANGING AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ADAPT OUR EXISTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO NEW PROCESSES, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN CUSTOMERS The semiconductor industry has been characterized by an increasingly rapid rate of development of new technologies and manufacturing processes. Our future success depends on our ability to develop new technologies, to adapt our existing intellectual property to satisfy the requirements of new processes and to introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner. As new technologies or manufacturing processes are announced, customers may defer licensing our intellectual property until those new technologies become available or our intellectual property have been adopted for that manufacturing process. If our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed, we may be unable to attract or retain customersOur ability to develop technical innovations involves several risks, including: - our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changes in the requirements of semiconductor companies; - the emergence of new semiconductor manufacturing processes and our ability to enter into strategic relationships with third-party semiconductor foundries to develop and test technologies for these new processes and provide customer referrals; - the significant research and development investment that we may be required to make before market acceptance, if any, of a particular technology; - the possibility that the industry may not accept a new technology after we have invested a significant amount of resources to develop it; and - new technologies introduced by our competitorsIf we are unable to adequately address these risks, our intellectual property will become obsolete and we will be unable to sell our products. Research and development requires a significant expense and resource commitment. Since we have a limited operating history and have only generated limited profits, we are unable to predict our future resources. As a result, we may not have the financial and other resources necessary to develop the technologies demanded in the future. In addition, since new technologies are being rapidly introduced, the industry may not accept the enhancements or new generations of the products that we develop and these new products may not generate revenues in excess of the costs of development. OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AND ANY FAILURE TO MEET FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR ANY FISCAL QUARTER MAY DISAPPOINT SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS AND COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINEOur quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Because our expenses are largely independent of our revenues in any particular period, we are unable to accurately forecast our operating results. As a result, if our revenues are 6 10 below expectations in any quarter, our inability to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for the revenue shortfall may magnify the negative effect of the revenue shortfallFactors that could cause our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter include: - large orders unevenly spaced over time; - establishment or loss of strategic relationships with third-party semiconductor foundries; - timing of new technologies and technology enhancements by us and our competitors; - shifts in demand for products that incorporate our intellectual property; - the impact of competition on license revenues or royalty rates; - the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry; and - changes in development schedules, research and development expenditure levels and product support by us and semiconductor companiesAs a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on these comparisons as indications of future performance. These factors may cause our operating results to be below market analysts' expectations in some future quarters, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS AND DEVELOP NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD-PARTY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURERS, OR FOUNDRIES, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO VERIFY OUR TECHNOLOGIES ON THEIR PROCESSES AND LICENSE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO THEIR CUSTOMERSOur ability to verify our technologies for new manufacturing processes depends on entering into development agreements with third-party foundries to provide us with access to these processes. In addition, we rely on third-party foundries to manufacture our silicon test chips and to provide referrals to their customer base. We currently have agreements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, and Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, or Chartered. If we are unable to maintain our existing relationships with these foundries or enter into new agreements with other foundries, we will be unable to verify our technologies for their manufacturing processes. We would then be unable to license our intellectual property to fabless semiconductor companies that use these foundries to manufacture their silicon chips, which is a significant source of our revenues. IF SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES DO NOT ADOPT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS DOES NOT CONTINUE TO INCREASE, OUR REVENUES WILL DECLINEOur continued success depends on the adoption and continued use of our intellectual property by semiconductor companies and an increasing demand for products requiring complex semiconductors and embedded memories, such as cellular and digital phones, pagers, digital cameras, DVD players, switches and modems. The markets for third-party semiconductor intellectual property and embedded memories have only recently begun to emerge. Our ability to achieve sustained revenue growth and profitability in the future will depend on the continued development of these markets and, to a large extent, on the demand for complex semiconductors. However, the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has fluctuated between significant economic downturns characterized by diminished demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity, as well as periods of increased demand and production capacity constraints. These types of fluctuations in the semiconductor industry may cause us to experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the recent emergence of the third-party semiconductor intellectual property and embedded memory markets, these markets may not continue to develop or grow at a rate sufficient to support our business. A downturn or slower than expected growth in the semiconductor 7 11 industry, a reduced number of design starts, tightening of customers' operating budgets or continued consolidation among our customers may seriously harm our revenues and profitability. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES TO LICENSE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMEDWe face numerous challenges in entering into license agreements with semiconductor companies on terms beneficial to our business, including: - the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with a potential licensee; - competition with the internal design teams of semiconductor companies; and - the need to persuade semiconductor companies to rely on us for critical technologyThese factors may make it difficult for us to maintain our current relationships or establish new relationships with additional licensees. If we are unable to maintain and establish these relationships, we will be unable to generate license fees and our revenues will decrease. We do not obligate any of our licensees to license new or future generations of our intellectual property. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTUREWe have incurred significant losses in the past. At March 31, 2000, our accumulated deficit was $13.7 million. Because we have experienced a history of losses, we cannot predict whether we will be profitable in the future. Further, you should not rely on the historical growth of our revenues as any indication of our future operating results or prospects. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING OUR ROYALTY-BASED REVENUES, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY MAY NOT BE AS LARGE AS WE ANTICIPATEWe have historically generated revenues almost entirely from license fees. In addition, we have agreements with certain third-party semiconductor foundries to pay us royalties on their sales of silicon chips they manufacture for our fabless customers. Beginning with our Custom-Touch STAR megabit and CAM technologies that are currently in development, in addition to collecting royalties from third-party semiconductor foundries, we intend to increase our royalty base by collecting royalties directly from our integrated device manufacturer and fabless customers. We have not yet obtained agreements with any integrated device manufacturer or fabless customers that include these royalty payments and may be unable to do so. Even if we are successful obtaining these agreements, they may not have the anticipated benefits. Through March 31, 2000, we have received approximately $9,000 of royalty revenues. The amount of royalties we receive in the future may not be significant. In addition, many factors beyond our control, such as fluctuating sales volumes of products that incorporate our intellectual property, commercial acceptance of these products, accuracy of revenue reports and difficulties in the royalty collection process, limit our ability to forecast our royalty revenues. WE RELY ON A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUESWe have been dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our annual revenues in each fiscal year, although the customers comprising this group have changed from time to time. In fiscal 1998, MMC Networks, National Semiconductor, PMC-Sierra, Silicon Dynamics and TeraLogic each generated more than 10% of our revenues for a total of 62% of our revenues. In fiscal 1999, ATI Technologies, MMC Networks, National Semiconductor and Toshiba each generated between 10% and 18% of our revenues for a total of 56% of our revenues. In the first half of fiscal 2000, IBM generated 10% of our revenues. We expect a small number of companies in the aggregate to represent between 20% to 40% of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The license agreements we enter into with our customers do not obligate them to license future generations of our intellectual property and, as a result, we cannot predict the length of our relationship with any significant customer. As a result of this customer concentration, we could experience a dramatic reduction in our revenues if we lose one or more 8 12 of our major customers and are unable to replace them. There are a relatively limited number of fabless semiconductor companies and integrated device manufacturers to which we can license our intellectual property. As a result of this limited universe of potential customers, our future sales depend on these manufacturers continuing to rely on third-party semiconductor intellectual property and adopting our intellectual property for future product generations. THE MARKET FOR EMBEDDED MEMORY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY LOSE MARKET SHARE TO LARGER COMPETITORS WITH GREATER RESOURCES AND TO COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP THEIR OWN MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES USING INTERNAL DESIGN TEAMSWe face competition from both existing suppliers of embedded memories such as Artisan Components and Avant!, as well as new suppliers that may enter the market. We also compete with the internal design teams of large, integrated device manufacturers. Many of these internal design teams have substantial programming and design resources and are part of larger organizations with substantial financial and marketing resources. These internal teams may develop technologies that compete directly with our technologies or may actively seek to license their own technologies to third partiesWe believe that our principal competitive advantages are the depth of our engineering expertise, our ability to offer manufacturing-tested products, the customizability of our products, the breadth of our product offering and our ability to offer memories for prevailing design technologies. However, many of our existing competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and larger customer bases, as well as greater financial and marketing resources, than we do. This may allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. It may also allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their products. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL WHO ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSWe believe that one of our significant competitive advantages is the size and quality of our engineering team. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain engineers and other highly skilled personnel and senior managers. In addition, part of our strategy also involves expanding our domestic sales force and hiring sales representatives in Europe. If we are unable to increase our sales force with qualified employees, we will be unable to expand our business. Our employees are "at will" and may leave our employment at any time. Hiring qualified technical, sales and management personnel is difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals and the intense competition in our industry for these types of employees. We have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel and believe that our employees are recruited aggressively by our competitors and start-up companies. Under certain circumstances, start-up companies can offer more attractive stock option packages than we offer. As a result, we may experience significant employee turnover. Failure to attract and retain personnel, particularly sales and technical personnel, would make it difficult for us to develop and market our technologiesIn addition, our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key personnel, including Adam A. Kablanian, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Alexander Shubat, our Vice President of Engineering and Chief Technical Officer. We do not have formal employment agreements with Mr. Kablanian or Mr. Shubat and do not maintain "key man" life insurance policies on their lives. If Mr. Kablanian or Mr. Shubat were to leave or become unable to perform services for our company, our business would be severely harmed. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DELIVER OUR CUSTOMIZED MEMORY PRODUCTS IN THE TIME-FRAME DEMANDED BY OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND FUTURE SALESA significant portion of our contracts require us to provide customized products within a set delivery timetable. We have experienced delays in the progress of certain projects in the past, and we may experience such delays in the future. Any failure to meet significant customer milestones could damage our reputation in our industry and harm our ability to attract new customers. 9 13 IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMEDOur future success depends on our ability to successfully manage our growth. Our ability to manage our business successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process. Our customers rely heavily on our technological expertise in designing and testing our products. Relationships with new customers may require significant engineering resources. As a result, any increase in the demand for our products will increase the strain on our personnel, particularly our engineersFrom January 1999 to June 2000, we grew from 38 to 126 full-time employees. This growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, significant strain on our managerial and financial resources as well as our limited financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. Although some new controls, systems and procedures have been implemented, our future growth, if any, will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational, financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis, together with maintaining effective cost controls. Since our growth has occurred over such a limited time period, we do not have sufficient experience managing the current size of our business to be able to fully assess our ability to continue to manage its growth in the future. Our inability to manage any future growth effectively would be harmful to our revenues and profitability. ANY ACQUISITIONS WE MAKE COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS AND HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITIONWe may attempt to acquire businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. To date, we have acquired a portion of the assets owned by Mentor Graphics for total consideration of 150,000 shares of Series C preferred stock. We currently have no commitments or agreements for any material acquisition and no material acquisition is currently being pursued. Although we have not experienced significant operational difficulties with our acquisition of assets from Mentor Graphics, we believe that future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. Since we will not be able to accurately predict these difficulties and expenditures, it is possible that these costs may outweigh the value we realize from a future acquisition. Future acquisitions could result in issuances of equity securities that would reduce our stockholders' ownership interest, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to goodwill or other intangible assets and the incurrence of large, immediate write-offs. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ADEQUATELY, WE WILL HAVE LESS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY TO LICENSE, WHICH WILL REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITSOur patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property are critical to our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, mask work and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. At July 27, 2000 we had four U.S. patents issued, eight pending U.S. patent applications and one draft application. In addition, we had two pending U.S. trademark applications. We cannot be sure that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will issue patents or trademark registrations for any of our pending applications. Further, any patents or trademark rights that we hold or may hold in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property as well as the laws of the United StatesWe use licensing agreements and employee and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information and to obtain ownership of technology prepared on a work-for-hire basis. Even though we have taken all customary industry precautions, we cannot be sure that we have taken adequate steps to protect our intellectual property rights and deter misappropriation of these rights or that we will be able to detect unauthorized uses and take immediate or effective steps to enforce our rights. Since we also rely on unpatented trade secrets to protect some of our proprietary technology, we cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire the same or substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology or disclose that technology. We also cannot be sure that we can ultimately protect our rights to 10 14 our unpatented proprietary technology. In addition, third parties might obtain patent rights to such unpatented trade secrets, which they could use to assert infringement claims against us. THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE ARE INFRINGING OR ASSISTING OTHERS TO INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION OR LICENSING EXPENSES OR BE PREVENTED FROM LICENSING OUR TECHNOLOGYWhile we do not believe that any of our technology infringes the valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology. As a result, third parties may claim we or our customers are infringing their intellectual property rights. Our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers for infringement actions related to our technologyAny litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved makes any outcome uncertain. If we do not prevail in any infringement action, we may be required to pay significant damages and may be prevented from developing some of our technology or from licensing some of our intellectual property for certain manufacturing processes unless we enter into a royalty or license agreement. In addition, if challenging a claim is not feasible, we might be required to enter into royalty or license agreements in order to settle a claim and continue to license or develop our intellectual property. These royalty or license agreements may result in significant expenditures. In addition, we may not be able to obtain such agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all, and thus, may be prevented from licensing or developing our technology. PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO LICENSE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYSales to customers located outside the United States accounted for 48% of our revenues in fiscal 1998, 44% of our revenues in fiscal 1999 and 54% of our revenues in the six months ended March 31, 2000. We anticipate that sales to customers located outside the United States will increase and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods. In addition, most of our customers that do not own their own fabrication plants rely on third-party foundries that may be outside of the United States. Accordingly, our operations and revenues are subject to a number of risks associated with foreign commerce, including the following: - managing foreign distributors; - staffing and managing foreign branch offices; - political and economic instability; - foreign currency exchange fluctuations; - changes in tax laws and tariffs; - timing and availability of export licenses; - inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; and - obtaining governmental approvals for certain technologiesIf these risks actually materialize, our sales to international customers, as well as those domestic customers that use foreign fabrication plants, may decrease. 11 15 CHANGES TO ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND RULES COULD EITHER DELAY OUR RECOGNITION OF REVENUES OR REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES THAT WE MAY RECOGNIZE AT A SPECIFIC TIME, AND THUS DEFER OR REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY. THESE EFFECTS ON OUR REPORTED RESULTS COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO BE LOWER THAN IT OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE BEENWe adopted the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition," and SOP 98-4, "Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition," as of October 1, 1998. In December 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 98-9, "Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions." SOP 98-9 amends SOP 98-4 to extend the deferral of the application of certain passages of SOP 97-2 with respect to the fair value of elements in multiple-element arrangements. We implemented these provisions as of October 1, 1999. Although the adoption of SOP 97-2, SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9 has not had, and we do not expect these adoptions to have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has not issued full implementation guidelines for SOP 97-2, SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" which summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. Additional accounting guidance or pronouncements in the future could affect the timing of our revenue recognition in the future. RISKS RELATED TO THE OFFERING OUR PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS HAVE SIGNIFICANT VOTING POWER AND MAY TAKE ACTIONS THAT MAY NOT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR OTHER STOCKHOLDERSAfter this offering, our officers, directors and principal stockholders will together control approximately 60.0% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, will be able to control our management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders. OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS WILL CONTAIN, AND DELAWARE LAW CONTAINS, PROVISIONS THAT COULD DISCOURAGE A TAKEOVER AND MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCKOur restated Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws will contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover. These provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or a change in our management. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Some of these provisions which will be contained in our restated Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws: - divide our board of directors into three classes with each class subject to election every three years; - authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval, commonly referred to as "blank check" preferred stock, with rights senior to those of common stock; - prohibit stockholder action by written consent; and - establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meetingSee "Description of Capital Stock" for a more detailed description of these provisions. 12 16 A SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, in the public market following this offering, the market price of our common stock could fall. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Upon the closing of this offering and our simultaneous private placement of 403,226 shares to Crosslink Capital, Inc., or its affiliates, we will have outstanding 18,837,627 shares of common stock, based upon shares outstanding on March 31, 2000, as adjusted for the 1-for-2 reverse stock split, and assuming no exercise of outstanding options after March 31, 2000. Of these shares, the 3,750,000 shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable. Of the remaining shares of common stock outstanding immediately after this offering, approximately 13,500,000 shares will be available for sale in the public market 180 days after the date of this prospectus when the lock-up agreements between the underwriters and the stockholders expire. However, some of those sales will be subject to the volume and other restrictions imposed by Rule 144 under the federal securities laws on our affiliates. On occasion, underwriters have removed lock-up restrictions early and it is possible that Lehman Brothers Inc. may remove some or all of these restrictions earlier than 180 days after the closing of this offeringThe remaining outstanding shares will become tradable upon expiration of various holding periods under Rule 144 (subject in some cases to the volume restrictions of that rule) or earlier and without restrictions if they are registered under the federal securities laws. After this offering, the holders of an aggregate of 11,917,000 shares of our common stock as well as the purchasers in the simultaneous private placement will have certain registration rights, including the right to include their shares in public offerings we undertake in the future. In addition, of these holders, the holders of 4,899,682 shares of common stock as well as the purchasers in the simultaneous private placement will have the right to require us to register the sale of their shares. See "Description of Capital Stock -- Registration Rights." WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE WHEN NEEDED WHICH COULD PREVENT US FROM GROWINGWe believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the simultaneous private placement, together with cash generated by our operations, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next 18 months. Aside from this offering, our primary sources of capital are our cash reserves and cash generated by operations. If our operations do not generate sufficient capital or if we have unexpected expenditures, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing or other arrangements. We cannot be certain that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business. In addition, additional equity financing may dilute our stockholders' interest, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on debt. If adequate funds are not available, we may need to curtail our operations significantly. OUR COMMON STOCK HAS NOT BEEN PUBLICLY TRADED, AND WE EXPECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLYOur common stock has not been publicly traded, and an active trading market may not develop or be sustained after this offering. We and the representatives of the underwriters have determined the initial public offering price. The price at which our common stock will trade after this offering is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors, in addition to our financial performance, such as: - industry announcements of technological innovations; - competitive trends, including timely adoption and market acceptance of, competing standards; - introduction of new technologies by us or our competitors; 13</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to buy our common stock. You should also consider the other information in this prospectus. In addition, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing BioMarin because we are also subject to additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows, could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. Risks Related To The Company If we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than anticipated, we may be unable to continue our operationsWe are in an early stage of development and have operated at a net loss since we were formed. Since we began operations in March 1997, we have been engaged primarily in research and development. We have no sales revenues from any of our drug products. As of March 31, 1999, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $19.7 million. We expect to continue to operate at a net loss at least through the calendar year 2000. Our future profitability depends on our receiving regulatory approval of our drug candidates and our ability to successfully manufacture and market any approved drugs, either by ourselves or jointly with others. The extent of our future losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, then we may be unable to continue our operationsBecause of the relative small size and scale of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Glyko, Inc., profits from products and services offered by it are expected to be insufficient to offset the expenses associated with our pharmaceutical business. As a result, we expect that operating losses will continue and increase for the foreseeable futureWe expect that our net loss and the size of our capital investments will increase significantly in the second quarter of 1999 in comparison to the first quarter of 1999 If we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations we will be unable to complete our product development programsIn the future, we may need to raise substantial additional capital to fund operations. We cannot be certain that any financing will be available when needed. If we fail to raise additional financing as we need it, we will have to delay or terminate our product development programs We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of capital for our operations for the foreseeable future. Activities which will require additional expenditures include: . research and development programs . preclinical studies and clinical trials . regulatory processes . establishment of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities and . expansion of sales and marketing activitiesThe amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, including: . The progress, timing and scope of our research and development programs . The progress, timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials . The time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 7 . The time and cost necessary to build our manufacturing facilities and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for those facilities . The time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments . Any changes made or new developments in our existing collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships . Any new collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish Moreover, our fixed expenses such as rent, license payments and other contractual commitments are substantial and will increase in the future. These fixed expenses will increase because we may enter into: . additional leases for new facilities and capital equipment . additional licenses and collaborative agreements . additional contracts for consulting, maintenance and administrative services . additional expenses associated with being a public companyWe believe that the net proceeds of this offering, together with our available cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment securities and investment income, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next 12 months. This estimate is based on assumptions which may prove to be wrong. As a result, we may need additional financing prior to that timeIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval to commercially manufacture or sell any of our future drug products, or if approval is delayed, we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of our products. We must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictionsWe must obtain regulatory approval before marketing or selling our future drug products. In the United States, we must obtain FDA approval for each drug that we intend to commercialize. The FDA approval process is typically lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain. Products distributed abroad are also subject to foreign government regulation. None of our drug products has received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed and sold. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval we will be unable to market and sell our future drug products. We have several drug products in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. BM101, our first drug product, is not expected to be commercially available until at least 2000. Our other drug product will not be commercially available for at least several more years. Because of the risks and uncertainties in biopharmaceutical development, our drug candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval. If regulatory approval is delayed our management's credibility, the value of our company and our operating results may be adversely affected. To obtain regulatory approval to market our products, preclinical studies and costly and lengthy clinical trials may be required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertainAs part of the FDA approval process, we must conduct, at our own expense, preclinical studies on animals and clinical trials on humans on each drug candidate. We expect the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that the FDA will require will vary depending on the drug product, the disease or condition the drug is being developed to address and regulations applicable to the particular drug. We may need to perform multiple preclinical studies using various doses and formulations before we can begin clinical trials, which could result in delays in our ability to market any of our drug productsFurthermore, even if we obtain favorable results in preclinical studies on animals, the results in humans may be different After we have conducted preclinical studies in animals we must demonstrate that our drug products are safe and effective for use on the target human patients in order to receive regulatory approval for 8 commercial sale. Adverse or inconclusive clinical results would stop us from filing for regulatory approval of our products. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials include: . Slow patient enrollment . Longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy . Lack of sufficient supplies of the drug candidate . Adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients . Lack of effectiveness of the drug candidate being tested Typically, if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time which ranges from six months to three years. In addition, clinical trials on humans are typically conducted in three phases. The FDA generally requires two pivotal clinical trials that demonstrate substantial evidence of safety and efficacy and appropriate dosing in a broad patient population at multiple sites to support an application for regulatory approval. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, a single trial may be sufficient to prove safety and efficacy under the FDA's Modernization Act of 1997. Our strategy to conduct only one clinical trial on a small number of patients for products developed to treat genetic disorders may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approvalWe believe that our enzyme drug products will be regulated by the FDA as biologics rather than drugs because they are manufactured by biological processes. Our strategy for the development of therapeutics for genetic disorders is to conduct only one clinical trial on a small number of patients, which would then be the basis for our submission of a biologics license application to the FDA. For example, at the end of October 1998, we completed a six-month evaluation of ten patients on our first drug candidate BM101. Because 12-month data will be available, the FDA has requested that we evaluate data for these patients for the 12-month period rather than the six-month period which formed the basis of our initial evaluation. In addition the FDA has also requested that we evaluate this data using other criteria that may demonstrate that the surrogate endpoints are a predictor of clinical benefit. We are currently performing this evaluation. We cannot assure you that this evaluation will support our findings with regard to the primary endpoints in the clinical trial. If this analysis does not support our findings with regard to the primary endpoints, or if the surrogate endpoints do not predict a clinical benefit, it could delay the filing of the biologics license application and could jeopardize FDA approval of BM101. The FDA may request additional trials to be conducted. If we have to conduct further clinical trials, whether for BM101 or other products we develop in the future, it would significantly increase our expenses and delay marketing of our product. Also, the results of initial smaller clinical trials could differ from the results obtained from subsequent more extensive long-term trials. A significant difference in the results of multiple clinical trials could cause the FDA to require still more clinical trials which would significantly delay the approval process. The fast track designation for BM101 may not actually lead to a faster review processAlthough BM101 has obtained a fast track designation, we cannot guarantee a faster review process or faster approval compared to the normal FDA procedures If BM101 is approved, we will be required to conduct a study after we obtain approval of BM101 to demonstrate that the primary endpoints used in our single study are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefits to the patients. If this post-approval study fails to verify the clinical benefit of BM101 or demonstrates that BM101 is not safe or effective, our FDA approval can be withdrawn on an expedited basis. Furthermore, if adverse effects are identified after marketing, FDA approval may be rapidly revoked and we could not market the drug. We will not be able to sell our products if we fail to comply with manufacturing regulationsBefore we can begin commercially manufacturing our products we must obtain regulatory approval of our manufacturing facility and process. In addition, manufacture of our drug products must comply 9 with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations, commonly known as cGMP. The cGMP regulations govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Our manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the FDA, the State of California and foreign regulatory authorities, before and after product approval. Because we are currently in the process of developing the manufacturing site and process for commercial manufacture of BM101, our facility has not yet been inspected by any governmental entity. We cannot guarantee that BioMarin, or any potential third- party manufacturer of our drug products, will be able to comply with cGMP regulations. Material changes to the manufacturing processes after approvals have been granted are also subject to review and approval by the FDA or other regulatory agenciesWe currently have a contract with Harbor-UCLA Research and Education Institute to manufacture BM101 in limited quantities for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials. In order to produce initial commercial requirements for BM101 in our facility we will have to prove that the product manufactured at our facility is comparable to the clinical trial product produced in the Harbor- UCLA facility. This will require laboratory testing and may require clinical trials. We must pass FDA and state inspections and manufacture three process qualification batches to final specifications under cGMP controls before the BM101 BLA can be approved. We cannot assure you that we will pass the inspections in a timely manner, if at allIf we fail to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our products, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions and our revenues may be reduced As part of our business strategy, we intend to develop drugs that may be eligible for FDA orphan drug designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of less than 200,000. The company that obtains the first FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the stated condition for a period of seven years. However, different drugs can be approved for the same conditionBecause the extent and scope of patent protection for our drug candidates is limited, orphan drug designation is particularly important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. We plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the orphan drug designation to maintain a competitive position. If we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for any one of our drug products, our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same conditionWe received orphan drug designation from the FDA for BM101 in September 1997 In February 1999, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for BM102 Even if we obtain orphan drug designation, we cannot guarantee that we will be the first to obtain marketing approval for any orphan indication or that exclusivity would effectively protect the product from competition. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the development or FDA review time of a drug so designated nor give the drug any advantage in the FDA review or approval processBecause the target patient populations for our products are small we must achieve significant market share and obtain high per patient prices for our products to achieve profitability Our initial drug candidates target disorders with small patient populations. As a result, our prices must be high enough to recover our development costs and achieve profitability. For example, two of our initial drug products in genetic disorders, BM101 and BM102, target patients with MPS-I and MPS-VI, respectively. We estimate that there are approximately 3,400 patients with MPS- I and 1,100 patients with MPS-VI in the developed world. We believe that we will need to market worldwide to achieve significant market share. In addition, we are developing other drug candidates to treat conditions, such as other genetic diseases and serious burns, with small patient populations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain sufficient market share for our drug products at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts. 10 If we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our drug products by third-party payors there would be no commercially viable markets for our productsThe course of treatment for patients with MPS-I using BM101 is expected to be expensive. We expect patients to need treatment throughout their lifetimes. We expect that families of patients will not be capable of paying for this treatment themselves. There will be no commercially viable market for BM101 without reimbursement from third-party payorsThird-party payors, such as government or private health care insurers, carefully review and increasingly challenge the price charged for drugs Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third-party payor, the insurance plan and other factors. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. We cannot be certain that third-party payors will pay for the costs of our drugs and the courses of treatment. Even if we are able to obtain reimbursement from third-party payors, we cannot be certain that reimbursement rates will be enough to allow us to profit from sales of our drugsWe currently have no expertise obtaining reimbursement. We expect to rely on the expertise of our partner Genzyme to obtain reimbursement for BM101. We cannot predict what the reimbursement rates will be. In addition, we will need to develop our own reimbursement expertise for future drug candidates unless we enter into collaborations with other companies with the necessary expertiseWe expect that in the future reimbursement will be increasingly restricted both in the United States and internationally. The escalating cost of health care has led to increased pressure on the health care industry to reduce costs Governmental and private third-party payors have proposed health care reforms and cost reductions. A number of federal and state proposals to control the cost of health care, including the cost of drug treatments have been made in the United States. In some foreign markets, the government controls the pricing which would affect the profitability of drugs. Current government regulations and possible future legislation regarding health care may affect our future revenues from sales of our drugs and may adversely affect our business and prospectsIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology we may not be able to compete as effectively Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our technology. Meaningful patent protection may not be available for some of the enzymes we are developing, including BM101 and BM102. If we must spend significant time and money protecting our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing, for excessively large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business and prospects may be harmedThe patent positions of biotechnology companies are extremely complex and uncertain. The scope and extent of patent protection for some of our products are particularly uncertain because key information on some of the enzymes we are developing has existed in the public domain for many years. Other parties have published the structure of the enzymes, the methods for purifying or producing the enzymes or the methods of treatment. The composition and genetic sequences of animal and/or human versions of many of our enzymes, including those for BM101 and BM102, have been published and are in the public domainThe composition and genetic sequences of other MPS enzymes which we intend to develop as products have also been published. Publication of this information may prevent us from obtaining composition of matter patents, which are generally believed to offer the strongest patent protection. For enzymes with no prospect of composition of matter patents, we will depend on orphan drug status. 11 In addition, our owned and licensed patents and patent applications do not ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of other reasons: . We do not know whether our patent applications will result in actual patents. For example, we may not have developed a method for treating a disease before others developed similar methods. . Competitors may interfere with our patent process in a variety of ways. Competitors may claim that they invented the claimed invention prior to us. Competitors may also claim that we are infringing on their patents and therefore cannot practice our technology as claimed under our patent. Competitors may also contest our patents by showing the patent examiner that the invention was not original, novel or was obvious. As a Company, we have no meaningful experience with competitors interfering with our patents or patent applications. . Even if we receive a patent, it may not provide much practical protection. If we receive a patent with a narrow scope, then it will be easier for competitors to design products that do not infringe on our patent. . Enforcing patents is expensive and may absorb significant time by our management. In litigation, a competitor could claim that our issued patents are not valid for a number of reasons. If the court agrees, we would lose that patentIn addition, competitors also seek patent protection for their technology There are many patents in our field of technology, and we cannot guarantee that we do not infringe on those patents or that we will not infringe on patents granted in the future. If a patent holder believes our product infringes on their patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology. If someone else claims we infringe on their technology, we would face a number of issues, including: . Defending a lawsuit takes significant time and can be very expensive. . If the court decides that our product infringes on the competitor's patent, we may have to pay substantial damages for past infringement. . The court may prohibit us from selling or licensing the product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us. The patent holder is not required to grant us a license. If a license is available, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to our patents. . Redesigning our product so it does not infringe may not be possible and could require substantial funds and timeIt is also unclear whether our trade secrets will provide useful protection While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know- howWe may also support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations or by universities. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to acquire any exclusive rights to technology or products derived from these collaborations. If we do not obtain required licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in product development while we attempt to design around other patents or even be prohibited from developing, manufacturing or selling products requiring these licenses. There is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties. 12 If our joint venture with Genzyme were terminated, we could be barred from commercializing BM101 or our ability to commercialize BM101 would be delayedWe are relying on Genzyme to apply the expertise it has developed through the launch and sale of Ceredase(R) and Cerezyme(R) enzymes for Gaucher disease, a rare genetic disorder, to the marketing of our initial drug product, BM101 Because it is our initial product, our operations are substantially dependent upon the development of BM101. We have no experience selling, marketing or obtaining reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. In addition, without Genzyme we would be required to pursue foreign regulatory approvals. We have no experience in seeking foreign regulatory approvalsWe cannot guarantee that Genzyme will devote the resources necessary to successfully market BM101. In addition, either party may terminate the joint venture for specified reasons, including if the other party is in material breach of the agreement or has experienced a change of control or has declared bankruptcy and also is in breach of the agreement. Either party may also terminate the agreement upon one year prior written notice for any reason after the earlier of December 31, 2000 or after the joint venture has received the FDA's approval of the biologics license application for BM101. Furthermore, we may terminate the joint venture if Genzyme fails to fulfill its contractual obligation to pay us $12.1 in cash upon the approval of the biologics license application for BM101Upon termination of the joint venture one party must buy out the other party's interest in the joint venture. The party who buys out the other will then also obtain, exclusively, all rights to BM101 and any related intellectual property and regulatory approvals. For a more detailed analysis of the economics of this buy out obligation see "Business--Corporate Collaborations--Joint Venture with Genzyme Corporation." If the joint venture is terminated by Genzyme for a breach on our part, Genzyme would be granted, exclusively, all of the rights to BM101 and any related intellectual property and regulatory approvals and would be obligated to buy out our interest in the joint venture. We would then effectively be unable to develop and commercialize BM101. If we terminated the joint venture for a breach by Genzyme, we would be obligated to buy out Genzyme's interest in the joint venture and, we would then be granted all of these rights to BM101 exclusively. While we could then continue to develop BM101, that development would be slowed because we would have to divert substantial capital to buy out Genzyme's interest in the joint venture and would then have to search for a new partner to commercialize the product and to obtain foreign regulatory approvals or to develop these capabilities ourselvesIf the joint venture is terminated by us without cause, Genzyme would have the option, exercisable for one year, to immediately buy out our interest in the joint venture and obtain all rights to BM101 exclusively. If the agreement is terminated by Genzyme without cause, we would have the option, exercisable for one year, to immediately buy out Genzyme's interest in the joint venture and obtain these exclusive rights. In event of termination of the buy out option without exercise by the non-terminating party as described above, all right and title to BM101 is to be sold to the highest bidder, with the proceeds to be split equally between Genzyme and usIf the joint venture is terminated by us because Genzyme fails to make the $12.1 million payment to us upon FDA approval of the biologics license application for BM101, we would be obligated to buy Genzyme's interest in the joint venture and would obtain all rights to BM101 exclusively. If the joint venture is terminated by either party because the other declared bankruptcy and is also in breach of the agreement, the terminating party would be obligated to buy out the other and would obtain all rights to BM101 exclusively. If the joint venture is terminated by a party because the other party experienced a change of control, the terminating party shall notify the other party, the offeree, of its intent to buy out the offeree's interest in the joint venture for a stated amount set by the terminating party at its discretion. The offeree must then either accept this offer or agree to buy the terminating party's interest in the joint venture on those same terms. The party who buys out the other would then have exclusive rights to BM101. 13 We cannot assure you that if the joint venture were terminated and if we were obligated, or given the option, to buy out Genzyme's interest in the joint venture, and gain exclusive rights to BM101, that we will have sufficient funds to do so or that we will be able to obtain the financing to do so. If we fail to buy out Genzyme's interest we may be held in breach of the agreement and may lose any claim to the rights to BM101 and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals. We would then effectively be prohibited from developing and commercializing the productTermination of the joint venture where we retain the rights to BM101 could cause us significant delays in product launch in the United States, difficulties in obtaining third-party reimbursement and delays or failure to obtain foreign regulatory approval, any of which could hurt our business and results of operations. Since Genzyme funds 50% of the joint venture's operating expenses, the termination of the joint venture would double our financial burden and reduce the funds available to us for other product programsIf we are unable to manufacture our drug products in sufficient quantities and at acceptable cost, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenues We have no experience manufacturing drug products in volumes that will be necessary to support commercial sales. Our unproven manufacturing process may not meet initial expectations as to schedule, reproducibility, yields, purity, costs, quality, and other measurements of performance. Improvements in manufacturing processes typically are very difficult to achieve and are often very expensive. We cannot know with any certainty how long it might take to make improvements if it became necessary to do so. If we contract for manufacturing services with an unproven process, our contractor is subject to the same uncertainties, high standards and regulatory controlsIf we are unable to establish and maintain commercial scale manufacturing within our planned time and cost parameters, sales of our products and our financial performance will be adversely affected We may encounter problems with any of the following if we attempt to increase the scale or size of manufacturing: . Design, construction and qualification of manufacturing facilities that meet regulatory requirements . Production yields . Purity . Quality control and assurance . Shortages of qualified personnel . Compliance with FDA regulations We are developing a total of 31,000 square feet of space at two facilities, one in Novato and one in Torrance, for the manufacture of BM101. The construction and qualification of these facilities may take longer than planned and the actual construction costs of these facilities may be higher than those which we have budgeted. We expect that the manufacturing process of all of our new products, including BM102, will also require lengthy development time before we can begin manufacturing them in commercial quantity. Even if we can establish this capacity, we cannot be certain that manufacturing costs will be commercially reasonable, especially if reimbursement is substantially lower than expected. 14 In order to achieve our product cost targets we must develop efficient manufacturing processes either by . improving the colonies of cells which have a common genetic make-up, or cell lines, . improving the processes licensed from others, or . developing a recombinant cell line and production processesA recombinant cell line is a cell line with foreign DNA inserted which is used to produce a protein that it would not have otherwise produced and related purification. The development of a stable, high production cell line for any given enzyme is risky, expensive and unpredictable and may not yield adequate results. In addition, the development of protein purification processes is difficult and may not produce the high purity required with acceptable yield and costs. If we are not able to develop efficient manufacturing processes, the investment in manufacturing capacity sufficient to satisfy market demand will be much greater and will place heavy financial demands upon us. If we do not achieve our manufacturing cost targets, we will have lower margins and reduced profitability in commercial production and greater losses in manufacturing start-up phasesIf we are unable to increase our marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, our ability to generate revenues will be diminished If we cannot increase our marketing capabilities either by developing our sales and marketing organization or by entering into agreements with others, w</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. these risks include, but are not limited to, those described below, each of which may be relevant to an investment decision. you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including our financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. the realization of any of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our reputation, business, including our financial condition, results of operations and growth, which we refer to collectively in this section as our business, and ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. in that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. risks related to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our current and future product candidatesdrug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes, and results from earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. failure or delay can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. these setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the required safety profile or meet the efficacy endpoints despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. notwithstanding any potential promising results in earlier testing, we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. we have completed phase 2 studies of sb204 and initiated our phase 3 trials in the first quarter of 2016. we are also currently conducting phase 2 trials of sb206 and sb208. we may experience delays in completing and initiating these ongoing and planned trials and we cannot be certain that the trials or any other future clinical trials for our product candidates will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. clinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delays or failures related to: the fda disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials; reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or cros, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different cros and trial sites; obtaining institutional review board, or irb, approval at each site; the safety profiles of our product candidates; recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial; having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up; clinical sites deviating from trial protocol; addressing patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial; adding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or 11 manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials. we could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the irbs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the data safety monitoring board, or dsmb, for such trial or by the fda or other regulatory authorities. such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the fda or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse events, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. if we experience delays in the completion, or termination, of any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed or not realized at all. any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. in addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. in addition, we are conducting preclinical studies for sb414. we plan to commence toxicology studies in 2016 in support of an ind submission, and we expect to initiate clinical development in the second half of 2017. our preclinical studies may not prove successful in demonstrating proof-of concept, or may show adverse toxicological findings, and even if successful may not necessarily predict that subsequent clinical trials will show the requisite safety and efficacy of our product candidates.we have never conducted a phase 3 clinical trial before, and may be unable to successfully do so for any of our product candidates. the conduct of a phase 3 clinical trial is a complex process that differs from clinical trials conducted in earlier phases. while some of our employees have conducted phase 3 clinical trials in the past while employed at different companies, we, as a company, have not conducted a phase 3 clinical trial before, and as a result, may require more time and incur greater costs than we anticipated. we commenced two identically designed phase 3 pivotal clinical trials of our lead product candidate, sb204, for the treatment of acne vulgaris in the first quarter of 2016. failure to complete, or delays experienced in, our clinical trials, or failure to commence any planned clinical trials would prevent us from, or delay us in, obtaining regulatory approval of and commercializing our product candidates.if we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. the timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends on, among other things, our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. we may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. the enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including: the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol; the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trials primary endpoints; the proximity of patients to trial sites; the design of the trial; our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience; 12 clinicians and patients perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating; our ability to obtain patient consents; and the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion. in addition, our clinical trials will compete for the recruitment of patients with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs, which would adversely impact our statement of operations and cash flows, or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates and hurt our competitive position.we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we intend to focus on developing product candidates for specific indications that we identify as most likely to succeed, in terms of their potential both to gain regulatory approval and to achieve commercialization. as a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or in other indications with greater commercial potential. our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to the product candidate.our product candidates may pose safety issues, cause adverse events or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any. we, any partner with whom we may collaborate in the future or the fda may suspend, delay, require modifications to or terminate our clinical trials at any time, for various reasons, including the discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or other safety issues experienced by trial participants. in addition, adverse events caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of adverse events or unexpected characteristics. to date, patients treated with our product candidates have experienced drug-related cutaneous tolerability observations, including dryness, scaling, burning, erythema, itching, pain or irritation, and adverse events, including irritation and contact dermatitis. if safety issues or unacceptable adverse events arise in the development of our product candidates, we, the fda, the irbs at the institutions in which our trials are conducted, or the dsmb could suspend or 13 terminate our clinical trials or the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease clinical trials or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. treatment-related adverse events could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. in addition, these adverse events may not be appropriately recognized or managed by the treating medical staff. any of the foregoing events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and may result in the loss of significant revenues to us, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and business.the regulatory approval processes of the fda are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed. the time required to obtain approval by the fda is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. in addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidates clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. we have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. neither we nor any future collaborator is permitted to market any of our product candidates in the united states until we receive regulatory approval of an nda from the fda. prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the united states or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the fda, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities. the fda may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program. the fda can delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidates or require us to conduct additional preclinical or clinical testing or abandon a program for many reasons, including: the fdas disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials; negative or ambiguous results from our clinical trials or results that may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the fda for approval; serious and unexpected drug-related adverse events experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates; our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indication; the fdas disagreement with the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; our inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh any safety or other perceived risks; the fdas requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials; the fdas disagreement regarding the formulation, labeling or the specifications of our product candidates; 14 the fdas agencys failure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; or the potential for approval policies or regulations of the fda to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval. of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the fda approval process and become commercialized. the lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of outcomes from future clinical trials may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates. even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of an nda or foreign marketing application for our product candidates, the fda may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials, including phase 4 clinical trials, or the implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or rems, which may be required to ensure safe use of the drug after approval. the fda also may approve a product candidate for a more limited indication or patient population than we originally requested, and the fda may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of a product candidate. any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of that product candidate.regulatory approval of our product candidates by foreign regulatory authorities may be delayed or denied. we may be subject to pricing controls imposed by foreign governments and regulatory authorities. we may seek regulatory approval of our product candidates from foreign regulatory authorities in the future. such regulatory authorities may impose additional regulations and guidelines that differ in form and substance from those imposed by their counterparts in the united states and with which we are more familiar. accordingly, the regulatory approval of our product candidates in those foreign jurisdictions could be delayed, limited or denied altogether. this could limit the scope of or prevent the commercialization of our products in the future and adversely affect our financial performance. further, in some countries, the pricing of pharmaceutical prescriptions is subject to governmental control. in these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. in addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after coverage and reimbursement have been obtained. reference pricing used by various countries and parallel distribution or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced countries can further reduce prices. to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies, which is time-consuming and costly. if coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates are unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed. even if our current product candidates or any future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption and use necessary for commercial success. the commercial success of any of our current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of the resulting product by physicians and patients for approved indications. our product candidates may not be commercially successful. the degree and rate of physician and patient adoption of our current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including: the clinical indications for which the product is approved and patient demand for approved products that treat those indications; the effectiveness of our product as compared to other available therapies; the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from managed care plans and other healthcare payors for any of our product candidates that may be approved; the cost of treatment with our product candidates in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for the product, if approved, on the part of patients; acceptance by physicians, major operators of clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment; physician and patient willingness to adopt a new therapy over other available therapies to treat approved indications; overcoming any biases physicians or patients may have toward particular therapies for the treatment of approved indications; patient satisfaction with the results and administration of our product candidates and overall treatment experience; the willingness of patients to pay for certain of our product candidates relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times; the revenue and profitability that our product candidates may offer a physician as compared to alternative therapies; the prevalence and severity of adverse events; limitations or warnings contained in the fda-approved labeling for our product candidates; any fda requirement to undertake a rems; the effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts; adverse publicity about our product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products; and potential product liability claims. if any of our current or future product candidates are approved for use but fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption necessary for commercial success, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.even if we make a submission under a special protocol assessment, or spa, from the fda, there is no guarantee that we will obtain agreement from the fda on the spa. even if we do obtain the fdas agreement, an spa would not guarantee approval of any of our product candidates or any other particular outcome from regulatory review. we currently do not have an spa in place with respect to any of our product candidates. we have previously made such a submission for an spa to the fda in connection with the design of our phase 3 16 clinical trials for sb204. we received feedback from the fda on our phase 3 trial design that we believed was sufficient to move forward on the phase 3 development program without further pursuing an spa. we recognize that the feedback obtained in connection with the spa discussions does not constitute a formal spa or a binding declaration from the fda that it agrees with the phase 3 clinical trials design, clinical endpoints or statistical analysis plan. we may, in the future, decide to make a submission for an spa for any of our current or future product candidates. the fdas spa process is designed to facilitate the fdas review and approval of drugs by allowing the fda to evaluate the proposed design and size of clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug products efficacy. upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the fda will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsors questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request. the fda ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to the effectiveness of the indication studied. all agreements and disagreements between the fda and the sponsor regarding an spa must be clearly documented in an spa letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the fda. even if the fda agrees to the spa, an spa agreement does not guarantee approval of a product candidate. even if the fda agrees to the design, execution, and analysis proposed in protocols reviewed under the spa process, the fda may revoke or alter its agreement in certain circumstances. in particular, an spa agreement is not binding on the fda if public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the spa agreement, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, the sponsor company fails to comply with the agreed upon trial protocols, or the relevant data, assumptions or information provided by the sponsor in a request for the spa change or are found to be false or omit relevant facts. in addition, even after an spa agreement is finalized, the spa agreement may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the fda review division, except under the circumstances described above, if the fda and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. the fda retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the spa agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the spa agreement. moreover, if the fda revokes or alters its agreement under the spa, or interprets the data collected from the clinical trial differently than we do, the fda may not deem the data sufficient to support an application for regulatory approval.our product candidates may cause side effects which could delay or prevent their commercialization. if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or other companies developing other nitric oxide-based therapies, including know bio, llc, which has the right to develop our current nitric oxide-based technology in non-dermatological indications, later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product; we may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients; additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof; regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a black box warning or a contraindication; we may be required to implement a rems or create a medication guide outlining the risks of such adverse events for distribution to patients; 17 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; the product may become less competitive; and our reputation may suffer. we expect to educate and train medical personnel so they know how to use our product candidates to understand their potential side effect profiles. inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of our product candidates could result in patient injury.if we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates or any future product candidate that receives regulatory approval, we may not be successful in commercializing those product candidates, if approved. we do not currently have a sales, marketing or distribution infrastructure in place. to achieve commercial success for any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales, marketing and distribution framework. in the future, we expect to build a focused sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to market any of our product candidates in the united states. there are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. for example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay market uptake. if the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. this may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include: our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel; the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products; the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization. if we are unable to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, this could, in turn, decrease our revenue and our profitability. in addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. we may not have adequate control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. if we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates. additionally, we are currently evaluating strategic partnerships to commercialize our dermatology products in select international markets. we may not be sufficiently familiar or have the requisite resources to penetrate international markets where some of our competitors have already achieved broad recognition and have established commercialization strategies in place. moreover, we may not succeed in targeting healthcare providers, including physicians, outside the dermatology prescribing base, who may not be familiar with our product candidates. our product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration. the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on developing proprietary therapeutics. numerous companies are engaged in the development, patenting, manufacturing and marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that we are developing. we face competition from a number of sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities, sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, research and development capabilities, clinical trial expertise, intellectual property portfolios, experience in obtaining patents and regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than we do. some of the companies that offer competing products also have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer relationships with our target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. in addition, certain of our product candidates, if approved, may compete with other dermatological products, including over-the-counter treatments, for a share of some patients discretionary budgets and for physicians attention within their clinical practices. many pharmaceutical companies currently offer products, and continue to develop additional alternative product candidates and technologies, for indications similar to those targeted by our product candidates, including galderma s.a., allergan, inc. and valeant pharmaceuticals international, inc. the markets for dermatological therapies are competitive and are characterized by significant technological development and new product introduction. we anticipate that, if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will face significant competition from other approved therapies. if approved, our product candidates may also compete with unregulated, unapproved and off-label treatments. to compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the relative cost, safety and efficacy of our approved products, if any, provide an attractive alternative to existing and other new therapies. such competition could lead to reduced market share for our product candidates and contribute to downward pressure on the pricing of our product candidates. due to less stringent regulatory requirements in certain foreign countries,</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS We have incurred operating losses, and we may not be profitable in the future We have incurred net losses in each quarter since inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As of March 31, 1999, we had an accumulated deficit of $33.4 million. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand our product development, sales and marketing and client service groups. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be profitable in any future period. See "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock priceOur license revenues have fluctuated substantially from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Many of the factors causing the fluctuations are listed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-- Quarterly Results of Operations." In addition, the fiscal or quarterly budget cycles of our users can cause our revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and applicable accounting policies may cause us to report new license agreements as deferred revenue until implementation begins. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful, and you should not rely on such comparisons to predict our future performance. We will continue to base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends. To the extent these expenses are not followed by increased revenues, our operating results will suffer. Fluctuations in our operating results, particularly compared to the expectations of market analysts or investors, could cause severe volatility in the price of our common stock. Our quarterly operating results depend on a small number of large ordersWe derive a significant portion of our product license revenue in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders. Our operating results for a particular fiscal quarter could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to complete one or more substantial license sales or implementations planned for that quarter. During the last nine quarters, four or fewer customers accounted for more than half of that quarter's total revenues. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Factors outside our control may cause the timing of our license revenues to vary from quarter-to-quarter, possibly adversely affecting our operating resultsUnder applicable accounting rules, we may experience further variability in our license revenues from quarter to quarter due to factors outside our control, including . variability in the mix of new and existing customers . whether we are providing implementation services . whether implementation is delayed or takes longer than expectedWhere we are implementing the software, we will account for the agreement as an item of deferred revenue and will recognize the revenue over the period of implementation. Most of our new customers begin implementation within 30 to 60 days of signing a license agreement. Once commenced, implementation of our products typically ranges from 60 to 90 days. We can't, however, guarantee that customers will begin implementation or that we will always be able to implement our software within those time periods. Thus, all of our deferred license revenue may not be recognized within the originally expected time period. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 5 Seasonality may adversely affect our quarterly operating resultsWe expect to experience seasonality in our license revenue. To date, we believe that seasonality has been masked by other factors, such as large orders and the timing of personnel changes in our sales staff. Our customers' purchase decisions are often affected by fiscal budgetary factors and by efforts of our direct sales force to meet or exceed sales quotas. As a result, we expect new business in the last quarter of a year to be greater than new business in the first quarter of the following year. One effect of our revenue recognition policy, however, is that revenue recognized in a quarter will typically not reflect all of the new license agreements signed and shipped in that quarter. Because revenue recognized in a given quarter may be primarily associated with new business in prior quarters, revenue in the first quarter may be higher than revenue recognized in the previous fourth quarter. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The limited sales history of our products makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospectsWe released our first SolutionSeries product in April 1995. As of March 31, 1999, approximately 40 companies licensed our SolutionSeries products. Accordingly, the basis upon which you can evaluate our prospects in general, and market acceptance of our products in particular, is limited. The market for problem-resolution software will have to grow significantly, and we will have to achieve broad market acceptance of our products, for our business to succeedMoreover, we released our Web-based products, SolutionPublisher and SolutionExplorer, in August 1996 and November 1997, respectively. The limited sales history of our Web-based products further limits your ability to evaluate our business and prospects. Additionally, part of our strategy is to extend our solutions to other functional areas where knowledge captured by our products may be useful, such as product development, sales and marketing and field service. Whether there will be significant demand for our products in these areas is untested and uncertain. We rely on sales of only one product familyProduct-license revenues and related services from our SolutionSeries products accounted for substantially all of our total revenues during fiscal 1998, and we expect revenues from our SolutionSeries products to continue to account for substantially all of our future revenues. As a result, factors adversely affecting the demand for our SolutionSeries products, such as competition, pricing or technological change, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our future financial performance will substantially depend on our ability to sell current versions of the SolutionSeries products and our ability to develop and sell enhanced versions of SolutionSeries products. Our future success depends in part on broad market acceptance of the Web as a delivery vehicle for problem resolutionPart of our strategy is to continue to increase our focus on developing and marketing Web-based products. Our Web-based products, SolutionExplorer and SolutionPublisher, accounted for approximately 33% of our software license revenue in 1998 and 51% in the first quarter of 1999. Broad market acceptance of the Web as a delivery vehicle for problem solutions to an enterprise's customers, resellers, channel partners and field representatives through Web self-service is critical to the success of our business. Thus, our future success substantially depends on continued growth in the use of the Internet and the continued development of the Internet as a viable commercial 6 communication medium. We cannot be certain that commercial Internet usage will continue to grow as it has in the past. If use of the Internet as a commercial communication medium does not continue to grow or evolves in a way that we cannot address, our business, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. Factors outside our control may make our products less usefulThe effectiveness of our SolutionSeries products depends in part on widespread adoption and use of our software by customer-support personnel in the extended enterprise and the quality of the solutions they generate. The problem-resolution database is developed by customer-support personnel that create solutions in the workflow and, sometimes, by importing a user's legacy solutions. If customer-support personnel do not adopt and use our products, necessary solutions will not be added to the database, and the database will be inadequate. Some of our users have found that customer- support personnel productivity initially drops while customer-support personnel become accustomed to using our software. If an enterprise deploying our software has not adequately planned for and communicated its expectations regarding that initial productivity decline, customer-support personnel may resist adoption of our software. In addition, if less-than-adequate solutions are created and left uncorrected by a user's quality-assurance processes or if the legacy solutions are inadequate, the database will similarly be inadequate, and the value of our SolutionSeries products to our users will be impaired. Thus, successful deployment and broad acceptance of our SolutionSeries products will depend in part on whether our users effectively roll-out and use our software products and the quality of the users' existing database of solutions, each of which are outside our control. See "Business--Products." The high level of competition in our market may result in pricing pressures, reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve market acceptanceThe market for our products is new and rapidly evolving, and is expected to become increasingly competitive as current competitors expand their product offerings and new companies enter the market. We face competition in the problem-resolution software market primarily from: . other problem-resolution software vendors . e-commerce customer-management software vendors . our potential users' internal information technology departments, which may choose to rely upon their own proprietary problem-resolution systems or develop new proprietary systemsAs the market for problem-resolution software matures, it is possible that new and larger companies will enter the market, existing competitors will form alliances or current and potential competitors could acquire, be acquired by or establish cooperative relationships with third parties. The resulting organizations could have greater technical, marketing and other resources and improve their products to address the needs of our existing and potential users, thereby increasing their market share. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance. See "Business--Competition." The loss of access to, or a problem with, Versant's database could adversely affect our businessWe incorporate into our products a database licensed from Versant. We are currently working to integrate our products with other databases; however we do not believe that the integrations will be completed for at least six months. Because our products currently rely on Versant's database, we depend on Versant's ability to support the database in a timely and effective manner. Until we finish integration of our products with other databases, losing access to Versant's database would have a material adverse effect on our ability to license our product to new users. See "Business--Products." 7 Failure to sufficiently expand our sales and marketing infrastructure would adversely affect our salesTo date, we have licensed our products primarily through our direct sales force. Our vice president of sales began working for us in January 1999, and we recently hired a vice president of marketing. Our future revenue growth will depend in large part on our ability to recruit, train and manage additional sales and marketing personnel and to expand our indirect distribution channels. We have experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified sales and marketing personnel and in establishing third-party relationships. We may not be able to successfully expand our direct sales force or other distribution channels and any such expansion may not result in increased revenues. Our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected if we fail to expand our sales and marketing resources. See "Business--Sales and Marketing." Our failure to retain skilled technical personnel in a tight labor market may adversely affect our product development, sales and customer satisfactionQualified technical personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry. The demand for qualified technical personnel is particularly acute in the Pacific Northwest, due to the large number of software companies and the low unemployment in the region. Our success depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical employees, particularly software architects and engineers. Our failure to attract and retain the highly-trained technical personnel that are integral to our direct sales, product-development and customer-support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Failure to properly integrate our management team would adversely affect our businessIn the last year we added three new members to our senior management team, none of whom worked together prior to joining Primus. Our success depends on the performance of our senior management and their ability to work together. Failure to properly integrate them would harm our business. Much of our success also depends on Michael A. Brochu, our president and chief executive officer. The loss of Mr. Brochu's services would harm our business. See "Management." Our inability to expand sufficiently our implementation and consulting capabilities would limit our ability to growIf sales of new licenses increased rapidly or if we were to sign a license agreement for a particularly large or complex implementation, our client services personnel may be unable to meet the demand for implementation services. In that case, if we were unable to retain or hire highly trained consulting personnel or establish relationships with third-party systems- integrators and consultants to implement our products, we would be unable to meet customer demands for implementation and educational services related to our products. A failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. See "Business--Strategy." Our international operations are subject to additional risksRevenues from customers outside the United States represented approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 1998, or 17% of our total 1998 revenues. A key component to our business strategy is to 8 expand our sales and support operations internationally. Our international operations will continue to be subject to a number of risks. These risks include: . costs of customizing products for foreign countries . laws and business practices favoring local competition . compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations . longer sales cycles . greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection . import and export restrictions and tariffs . difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations . political and economic instabilityOur international operations also face foreign-currency-related risks. To date, substantially all of our revenues have been denominated in U.S. dollars, but we believe that in the future, an increasing portion of our revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, which was introduced in January 1999. The Euro is an untested currency and may be subject to economic risks that are not currently contemplated. Fluctuations in the value of the Euro or other foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial conditionWe currently customize our products for the Japanese market. In the future, we may develop additional localized versions of our products. Localization of our products could create additional costs and cause delays in new product introductions. Our failure to adapt to technology trends and evolving industry standards would hinder our competitivenessOur market is susceptible to rapid changes due to technology innovation, evolving industry standards, and frequent new service and product introductions. New services and products based on new technologies or new industry standards expose us to risks of technical or product obsolescence. We will need to use leading technologies effectively, continue to develop our technical expertise and enhance our existing products on a timely basis to compete successfully in this industry. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in using new technologies effectively, developing new products or enhancing existing products on a timely basis or that any new technologies or enhancements used by us or offered to our customers will achieve market acceptance. Our inability to continue integration of our products with other third-party software could adversely affect market acceptance of our productsOur ability to compete successfully also depends on the continued compatibility and interoperability of our products with products and systems sold by various third parties, specifically including customer-relationship- management software sold by Clarify, ONYX Software, Remedy, Siebel Systems and Vantive. Currently, these vendors have open applications program interfaces, which facilitate our ability to integrate with their systems. If any one of them should close their programs' interface or if they should acquire one of our competitors, our ability to provide a close integration of our products could become more difficult and could delay or prevent our products' integration with future systems. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequateOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, 9 confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in license agreements with consultants, vendors and customers. We have not signed such agreements in every case. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Other parties may breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts we have entered into. We may not become aware of, or have adequate remedies in the event of, such breachWe pursue the registration of some of our trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain other countries, but we have not secured registration of all our marks. A significant portion of our marks include the word "Primus." Other companies use "Primus" in their marks alone or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all third-party uses of the word "Primus." We license certain trademark rights to third parties. Such licensees may not abide by compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights and may take actions that would adversely affect our trademarks. Other companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property or proprietary rightsIf any of our products violate third party proprietary rights, we may be required to reengineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, and such efforts may not be successful. We do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties. Product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies. In addition, other companies have filed trademark applications for marks similar to the names of our products. Although we believe that our products do not infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties, third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future. The defense of any such claims would require us to incur substantial costs and would divert management's attention and resources to defend against any claims relating to proprietary rights, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations. Parties making such claims could secure a judgment awarding them substantial damages, as well as injunctive or equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to sell our services. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Control by insider shareholders of a large percentage of our voting stock may permit them to influence Primus in a way that adversely affects our stock priceFollowing the closing of this offering, our officers, directors and affiliated entities together will beneficially own approximately 32% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (30% if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). As a result, these shareholders will be able to influence all matters requiring shareholder approval and, thereby, our management and affairs. Some matters that typically require shareholder approval include: . election of directors . certain amendments to our articles of incorporation . merger or consolidation . sale of all or substantially all our assetsThis concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would result in a change of control, which in turn could reduce the market price of our common stock. See "Principal and Selling Shareholders." 10 Management has broad discretion in using the net proceeds from this offering We have not identified specific uses for the net proceeds from this offering, and we will have broad discretion in how we use them. See "Use of Proceeds." Our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Washington law contain provisions that could discourage a takeoverCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and our bylaws and Washington law could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of Primus, which could reduce the market price of our stock. See "Description of Capital Stock." Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock priceAfter this offering, we will have outstanding 13,501,796 shares of common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market following this offering could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. All the shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable. The remaining shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be available for sale in the public market as follows: <TABLE> <CAPTION> Number of Date of Availability for Sale Shares ----------------------------- --------- <S> <C> Upon effectiveness of this offering......................... 224,829 90 days after effectiveness of this offering................ 18,150 181 days after the date of this prospectus.................. 8,863,297 At various times thereafter upon the expiration of one-year holding periods............................................. 245,520 --------- Total.......................................................... 9,351,796 ========= </TABLE>See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale" and "Underwriting." Year 2000 remediation may involve significant time and expense and may reduce our future sales Many currently installed computer systems are not capable of distinguishing 21st century dates from 20th century dates or have been programmed with default dates ending in "99," the common two-digit reference for 1999. As a result, as we transition from the 20th century to the 21st century, computer systems and software used by many companies and organizations in a wide variety of industries, including technology, transportation, utilities, finance and telecommunications, will produce erroneous results or fail unless they have been modified or upgraded to process date information correctly. Although we believe the current versions of our software products are Year 2000 compliant, we may face claims based on Year 2000 issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system. We may also experience reduced sales of our products as potential customers reduce their budgets or delay new purchases for customer-support software due to increased expenditures on their own Year 2000 compliance efforts. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Year 2000 Compliance." Changes in accounting standards could affect the calculation of our future operating resultsIn October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued its Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition," and later amended its position by its Statement of 11 Position 98-4. We adopted Statement of Position 97-2 effective January 1, 1998. Based on our interpretation of the AICPA's position, we believe our current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with Statement of Position 97-2 and Statement of Position 98-4. The AICPA has also issued Statement of Position 98-9, which is effective for transactions we enter into beginning January 1, 2000. However, full implementation guidelines for these standards have not yet been issued. Once available, such implementation guidelines could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, the accounting standard setters, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, are reviewing the accounting standards related to stock-based compensation. Any changes to this standard or any other accounting standards could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statementsThis prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. the trading price and value of our ordinary shares could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. this prospectus also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this prospectus. risks related to us and our industryif we are unable to maintain existing, and establish new, arrangements with our travel suppliers, our business may be adversely affected. our business is dependent on our ability to maintain our relationships and arrangements with existing suppliers, such as airlines which supply air tickets to us directly, amadeus (our gds service provider) and indian railways, as well as our ability to establish and maintain relationships with new travel suppliers, including hotels, bus operators and car hire companies. a substantial portion of our revenue less service cost is derived from fees and commissions negotiated with travel suppliers for bookings made through our websites or via our other distribution channels. adverse changes in existing arrangements, including an inability by any travel supplier to fulfill their payment obligation to us in a timely manner, increasing industry consolidation or our inability to enter into new arrangements with these parties on favorable terms, if at all, could reduce the amount, quality, pricing and breadth of the travel services and products that we are able to offer, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. no assurance can be given that our agreements or arrangements with our travel suppliers or gds service provider will continue or that our travel suppliers or gds service provider will not reduce or eliminate fees or commissions or attempt to charge us for content, terminate our contracts and seek to recover signing bonuses or default on or dispute their payment obligations towards us, any of which could reduce our revenue and net revenue margins or may require us to initiate legal or arbitral proceedings to enforce their contractual payment obligations, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.we do not have formal agreements with many of our travel suppliers. we rely on various travel suppliers to facilitate the sale of our travel services. we do not have formal agreements with many of our travel suppliers, including low-cost airlines and many hotels whose booking systems or central reservations systems are relied upon by us for bookings and confirmation as well as certain payment gateway arrangements, and there can be no assurance that these third parties will not terminate these arrangements with us at short notice or without notice. further, where we have entered into formal agreements, many of these agreements are short-term contracts, providing our counterparties with a right to terminate at short notice or without notice. many of our airline suppliers with whom we have contracts are able to either terminate or alter the terms of their contracts with us at will or by providing a few days notice. for example, our agreement with indian railways catering and tourism corporation limited, or irctc, which allows us to transact with indian railways passenger reservation system through the internet can be terminated by irctc without prior notice and at its sole discretion. termination of any of the abovementioned agreements and/or arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.we have sustained operating losses in the past and may experience operating losses in the future. we sustained operating losses in all our fiscal years. we cannot assure you that we can attain profitability or avoid operating losses in the future. we expect that our operating expenses will increase and the degree of increase in these expenses will be largely based on anticipated organizational growth and revenue trends. as a result, any decrease or delay in generating additional sales volumes and revenue could result in substantial operating losses. we rely on third-party systems and service providers, and any disruption or adverse change in their businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business. we currently rely on certain third-party computer systems, service providers and software companies, including the gds used by full service airlines, and electronic central reservation systems used by low-cost airlines, certain hotels which are directly-connected to us, indian railways and bus operators. in particular, we rely on third parties to: assist in conducting searches for airfares and process air ticket bookings; process hotel reservations; process credit card payments; provide computer infrastructure critical to our business;and provide customer relationship management, or crm, software services. any interruption or deterioration in performance of these third-party systems and services could have a material adverse effect on our business. further, the information provided to us by certain of these third-party systems, such as the central reservations systems of certain of our hotel suppliers, may not always be accurate due to either technical glitches or human error, and we may incur monetary and/or reputational loss as a result. our success is also dependent on our ability to maintain our relationships with these third-party systems and service providers, including our technology partners. in the event our arrangements with any of these third parties are impaired or terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, which could result in significant additional costs or disruptions to our business.we outsource a significant portion of our call center services and if our outsourcing service providers fail to meet our requirements or face operational or system disruptions, our business may be adversely affected. we outsource our call center service for sales for all international flights and most of our domestic indian hotel reservations and packages. we also outsource our call center service for post-sales customer service support for all flights (domestic and international), domestic indian hotel reservations and packages, and rail and bus ticketing, as well as back office fulfillment and ticketing services, to various third parties in india. if our outsourcing service providers experience difficulty meeting our requirements for quality and customer service standards, our reputation could suffer and our business and prospects could be adversely affected. our operations and business could also be materially and adversely affected if our outsourcing service providers face any operational or system interruptions. further, many of our contracts with outsourcing service providers are short-term or have short notice periods. for example, our agreement with intelenet global services, which provides call center services for our indian domestic air ticketing and international air ticketing business, as well as post-sales customer service support for air tickets, is for a renewable term of three years but may be terminated by either party on two months notice. in the event one or more of our contracts with our outsourcing service providers is terminated on short notice, we may be unable to find alternative outsourcing service providers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. further, the quality of the service provided by a new or replacement outsourcing service providers may not meet our requirements, including during the transition and training phase. hence, termination of any of our contracts with our outsourcing service providers could cause a decline in the quality of our services and disrupt and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.we rely on information technology to operate our business and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business. we depend on the use of sophisticated information technology and systems, which we have customized in-house, for search and reservation for flights and hotels, as well as payments, refunds, customer relationship management, communications and administration. as our operations grow in both size and scope, we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer our customers enhanced services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure in a cost- 11 effective manner. our future success also depends on our ability to upgrade our services and infrastructure ahead of rapidly evolving consumer demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of our service in response to competitive offerings. we may not be able to maintain or replace our existing systems or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors, in a cost-effective manner or at all. we may also be unable to devote adequate financial resources to develop or acquire new technologies and systems in the future. we may not be able to use new technologies effectively, or we may fail to adapt our websites, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure to consumer requirements or emerging industry standards. if we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced solutions, our customers may forego the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations. we currently license from third-parties some of the technologies incorporated into our websites. as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies, we may be required to license additional technology. we cannot be sure that such technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.the travel industry for india and india-related travel is intensely competitive, and we may not be able to effectively compete in the future. the indian travel market is intensely competitive. factors affecting our competitive success include, among other things, price, availability and breadth of choice of travel services and products, brand recognition, customer service, fees charged to travelers, ease of use, accessibility and reliability. we currently compete with both established and emerging providers of travel services and products, including other online travel agencies, such as cleartrip.com, expedia.co.in, travelocity.co.in and yatra.com, as well as traditional travel agencies, tour operators, travel suppliers and operators of travel industry reservation databases. certain of our competitors have also launched websites in other countries to better cater to indian and other customers located in those areas. for example, cleartrip.com recently launched website operations in the united arab emirates. large, established internet search engines have also recently launched applications offering travel itineraries in destinations around the world, and meta-search companies who can aggregate travel search results also compete against us for customers. some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than us and certain of our competitors have a longer history of established businesses and reputations in the indian travel market (particularly in the hotels and packages business) as compared with us. further, we may also face increased competition from new entrants in our industry. we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete against existing or new competitors in our existing lines of business as well as new lines of business into which we may venture. if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. some travel suppliers are seeking to decrease their reliance on distribution intermediaries such as us by promoting direct distribution channels. many airlines, hotels, car rental companies and tour operators have call centers and have established their own travel distribution websites. from time to time, travel suppliers offer advantages, such as bonus loyalty awards and lower transaction fees or discounted prices, when their services and products are purchased from supplier-related channels. we also compete with competitors who may offer less content, functionality and marketing reach but at a relatively lower cost to suppliers. if our access to supplier-provided content or features were to be diminished either relative to our competitors or in absolute terms or if we are unable to compete effectively with travel supplier-related channels, our business could be materially and adversely affected.some of our airline suppliers (including our gds service provider) may reduce or eliminate the commission and other fees they pay to us for the sale of air tickets, and this could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in our air ticketing business, we generate revenue through commissions and incentive payments from airline suppliers, service fees charged to our customers and fees from our gds service provider. our airline suppliers may reduce or eliminate the commissions and incentive payments they pay to us. to the extent any of our airline 12 suppliers reduce or eliminate the commissions or incentive payments they pay to us, our revenue may be reduced unless we are able to adequately mitigate such reduction by increasing the service fee we charge to our customers in a sustainable manner. however, any increase in service fees may also result in a loss of potential customers. further, our arrangement with the airlines that supply air tickets to us may limit the amount of service fee that we are able to charge our customers. our business would also be negatively impacted if competition or regulation in the indian travel industry causes us to have to reduce or eliminate our service fees.we rely on the value of our brand, and any failure to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we believe continued investment in our brand, makemytrip, is critical to retain and expand our business. we believe that our brand is well respected and recognized in the indian travel market, particularly in the air ticketing segment. however, we are relatively new in the hotels and packages segment, and may not enjoy the same brand recognition in this business. we have invested in developing and promoting our brand since our inception and expect to continue to spend on maintaining our brands value to enable us to compete against increased spending by our competitors, as well as against emerging competitors, including search engines and meta-search engines, and to allow us to expand into new geographies and products where our brand is not well known. our marketing costs may also increase as a result of inflation in media pricing (including search engine keywords). there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brand. even if we are successful in our branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective. if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brand and generate demand in a cost-effective manner, it would negatively impact our ability to compete in the travel industry and would have a material adverse effect on our business. see also we cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others, including current or potential competitors.we may not be successful in implementing our growth strategies. our growth strategy involves expanding our hotels and packages business, travel agents network and our service offerings. further, one of our strategies is to enhance our service platforms by investing in technology, and expanding into new geographic markets. our success in implementing our growth strategies are affected by: our ability to increase the number of suppliers, especially our hotel suppliers, that are directly-connected to us, which is dependent on the willingness of such suppliers to invest in new technology; our ability to continue to expand our distribution channels, and market and cross-sell our travel services and products to facilitate the expansion of our business; our ability to build or acquire the required technology; the general condition of the global economy (particularly in india and markets with close proximity to india) and continued growth in demand for travel services, particularly online; our ability to compete effectively with existing and new entrants to the indian travel industry, including both online travel companies as well as traditional travel agents and tour providers; the growth of the internet as a medium for commerce in india;and changes in our regulatory environment. many of these factors are beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will succeed in implementing our strategy. separately, our growth strategy also involves expanding into new geographic markets which will involve additional risks. see our international operations, some of which are new to us, involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our international operations.we may not be successful in pursuing strategic partnerships and acquisitions, and future partnerships and acquisitions may not bring us anticipated benefits. part of our growth strategy is the pursuit of strategic partnerships and acquisitions. there can be no assurance that we will succeed in implementing this strategy as it is subject to many factors which are beyond our control, including our ability to identify, attract and successfully execute suitable acquisition opportunities and partnerships. 13 this strategy may also subject us to uncertainties and risks, including acquisition and financing costs, potential ongoing and unforeseen or hidden liabilities, diversion of management resources and cost of integrating acquired businesses. we could face difficulties integrating the technology of acquired businesses with our existing technology, and employees of the acquired business into various departments and ranks in our company, and it could take substantial time and effort to integrate the business processes being used in the acquired businesses with our existing business processes. moreover, there is no assurance that such partnerships or acquisitions will achieve our intended objectives or enhance our revenue. in march 2010, we acquired certain assets of travis internet private limited, an online bus ticketing company, including the website www.ticketvala.com, which gives us the ability to provide our bus suppliers with access to a real time bus reservations technology platform. we intend to leverage this platform to enable more bus operators to be directly-connected to our booking system with such technology, but there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully leverage this new platform to further expand our bus offering.our arrangements with some of our suppliers may subject us to additional monetary risks. we generally do not assume inventory risk in our air ticketing business as we typically act as an agent. however, on a few occasions, we pre-purchase air ticket inventory in order to enjoy special negotiated rates and we assume inventory risk on such tickets. if we are unable to sell these tickets as anticipated either at all, or at expected rates, our revenue and business may be adversely affected. we also generally do not guarantee a minimum number of room reservations to our hotel suppliers. however, in a few instances, particularly when we anticipate high volumes of room reservations, we may enter into arrangements with one or more of our hotel suppliers where we guarantee a minimum number of room reservations through us at an agreed rate, in order to obtain favorable terms or discounts. we may use this guaranteed model increasingly for future transactions with hotels as our business expands. although we have generally been able to obtain extensions from our hotel suppliers where we have been unable to sell our minimum guaranteed number of rooms, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain similar extensions in the future. such guarantees may result in losses to us if we are unable to fulfill our commitment to the hotels or if we are unable to obtain similar extensions.certain of our businesses or services have only recently been introduced and, as a result, it may be difficult to evaluate their performance and prospects. some of the services and products offered by us were introduced very recently. for example, we started our bus ticketing business in may 2008 and our rail ticketing business in june 2009. as a result, these businesses have a limited operating history and it may be difficult to evaluate their performance and prospects.our international operations, some of which are new to us, involve additional risks. we have been operating in the united states since 2000, servicing mainly the air ticketing needs of non-resident indians in the united states traveling inbound to india. we also launched our website in the united arab emirates in december 2009 and launched our website in canada in july 2010, following, among other things, the registration of our websites domain names (www.makemytrip.ae and www.makemytrip.ca) with the relevant registry as well as the procurement of additional servers to handle the increased traffic from these international websites. our website in canada is currently owned by a company which we have registered in canada. we intend to transfer legal ownership of this company to us in august 2010. we need to continue to tailor our services and business model to the unique circumstances of such markets to succeed, including building new supplier relationships and customer preferences. we also intend to expand our business in other markets, particularly those with a significant non-resident indian population as well as those with proximity to india or favored by indian travelers. adapting our practices and models effectively to the supplier and customer preferences of new markets could be difficult and costly and could divert management and personnel resources. we could also face additional regulatory requirements in our new markets which could be onerous. we cannot assure you that we will be able to efficiently or effectively manage the growth of our operations in these new markets. in addition, we are subject to additional risks in our new international operations that may not exist in our indian operations, including: differences and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and exposure to local economic conditions; 14 differences in consumer preferences in such markets; increased risk to and limits on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights; competition from providers of travel services in such foreign countries; restrictions on the repatriation of earnings from such foreign countries, including withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions;and currency exchange rate fluctuations. if we are not able to effectively mitigate or eliminate these risks, our results of operations could be adversely affected.our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine logic. we utilize internet search engines such as googletm and yahoo!tm india, including through the purchase of travel-related keywords, to drive traffic to our websites. these search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a users search, such that the purchased or optimal placement of links to our websites may be negatively affected. in addition, a significant amount of our business is directed to our websites through pay-per-click and display advertising campaigns on the internet and search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can rapidly change, both technically and competitively. if major search engines such as googletm or yahoo!tm india, which we utilize for a significant amount of our search engine traffic, change the logic used on their websites for search results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking, paid or unpaid, of our websites or those of our third-party distribution partners, we may experience a decline in traffic on our websites and our business may be adversely affected.system interruption in our information systems and infrastructure may harm our business. we rely significantly on computer systems to facilitate and process transactions. we may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling bookings or providing services to our customers. any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, or deterioration in their performance, could impair our ability to process transactions and decrease the quality of our service to our customers. if we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures, our reputation and brand could be harmed. while we have backup systems and contingency plans for critical aspects of our operations or business processes, certain other non-critical systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient. fires, floods, power outages, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of god, computer viruses, sabotage, break-ins and electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage, impact or interrupt our computer or communications systems, business processes or infrastructure at any time. although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets, any of these events could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to our customers and/or suppliers for a significant period of time. we do not carry business interruption insurance for such eventualities. remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs. moreover, the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain.we are exposed to risks associated with online security and credit card fraud. the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential in maintaining customer and supplier confidence in us. security breaches, whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet-based systems, could significantly harm our business. we currently require customers to guarantee their transactions with their credit cards online. we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential customer information, including credit card numbers, over the internet. however, advances in technology or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect customer and transaction data. we incur substantial expense to protect against and remedy security breaches and their consequences. however, our security measures may not prevent 15 security breaches and we may be unsuccessful in or incur additional costs by implementing our remediation plan to address these potential exposures. we also have agreements with banks and certain companies that process customer credit card transactions for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers. the online payment gateway for certain of our sales made through our mobile platform or through international credit cards is not secured by verified by visa or mastersecure, and we may be liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites. we may also be subject to other payment disputes with our customers for such sales. if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards, our revenue from such sales would be susceptible to demands from the relevant banks and credit card processing companies, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance. our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the indian as well as worldwide travel industry, including changes in supply and pricing. events specific to the travel industry that could negatively affect our business include continued fare increases, travel-related strikes or labor unrest, fuel price volatility and bankruptcies or liquidations of our suppliers. additionally, our business is sensitive to safety concerns, and thus our business has in the past declined and may in the future decline after incidents of actual or threatened terrorism, during periods of political instability or conflict or during other periods in which travelers become concerned about safety issues, including as a result of natural disasters such as tsunamis or earthquakes or when travel might involve health-related risks, such as the influenza, h1n1 virus, avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or other epidemics or pandemics. such concerns are outside our control and could result in a significant decrease in demand for our travel services. any such decrease in demand, depending on its scope and duration, together with any other issues affecting travel safety, could significantly and adversely affect our business and financial performance over the short and long term. the occurrence of such events could result in disruptions to our customers travel plans and we may incur additional costs and constrained liquidity if we provide relief to affected customers by not charging cancellation fees or by refunding the cost of airline tickets, hotel reservations and other travel services and products. if there is a prolonged substantial decrease in travel volumes, particularly air travel and hotel stays, for these or any other reasons, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by global economic conditions. consumer purchases of discretionary items generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. as a substantial portion of travel expenditure, for both business and leisure, is discretionary, the travel industry tends to experience weak or reduced demand during economic downturns. unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could result in fewer reservations made through our websites and/or lower our net revenue margins, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in the second half of calendar year 2008 and the first half of calendar year 2009, there was a rapid deterioration of global economic conditions, including economic conditions in india, which impacted our business. the current economic environment continues to be uncertain. the weakness and uncertainty in the economy has negatively impacted both corporate and consumer spending patterns and demand for travel services in general. as an intermediary in the travel industry, a significant portion of our revenue is affected by fares and tariffs charged by our suppliers as well as volumes of sales made by us. during periods of poor economic conditions, airlines and hotels tend to reduce rates or offer discounted sales to stimulate demand, thereby reducing our commission-based income. a slowdown in economic conditions may also result in a decrease in transaction volumes and adversely affect our revenue. it is difficult to predict the effects of the uncertainty in global economic conditions. if economic conditions worsen globally or in india, our growth</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in the common stock. although the risks described below are all of the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business and the common stock. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. the trading price could decline due to any of these risks and, therefore, you may lose all or part of your investment. risk factors relating to the common stock and the offering we have a single shareholder who can substantially influence the outcome of all matters voted upon by our shareholders and prevent actions which a shareholder may otherwise view favorably. at september 30, 2003, the apollo funds owned approximately 87.4% of our outstanding common stock, and will own approximately 57.7% of our outstanding common stock immediately after giving effect to the transaction (approximately 55.0% if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full). as a result, apollo can and will be able to substantially influence all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as acquisitions, the ability to block an unsolicited tender offer and any other matter requiring a supermajority vote of shareholders, and will continue to be able to do so immediately after this offering. this concentration of ownership could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our company or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination which you, as a shareholder, may otherwise view favorably.our ability to issue blank check preferred stock and florida law may prevent a change in control of our company that you as a shareholder may consider favorable. provisions of our articles of incorporation and florida law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable. these provisions include: authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares in order to thwart a takeover attempt; elimination of the voting rights of shareholders with respect to shares that are acquired without prior board approval that would otherwise entitle such shareholder to exercise certain amounts of voting power in the election of directors; and prohibition on business combinations with interested stockholders unless particular conditions are met. as a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.the price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause investors to incur trading losses and fail to realize upon their investments. prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest will lead to the development of an active and liquid trading market in our common stock. the initial public offering price for the shares was determined by negotiations between us and the representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of the market price of the common stock that will prevail in the trading market. the market price of the common stock may decline below the initial public offering price. some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them. if a suit were to be filed against us, regardless of the outcome, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources. this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. future sales of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing shareholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after this offering or the perception that such sales may occur. these sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell additional equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate. there will be approximately 18,012,311 shares of common stock outstanding immediately after this offering, including after giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into shares of our common stock. in addition, there will be 291,186 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of all outstanding warrants, all of which are currently exercisable. all of the shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended, except for shares purchased by our affiliates as defined in rule 144 under the securities act. upon completion of this offering 11,012,311 shares of common stock will be either restricted securities or affiliate securities as defined in rule144. subject to the one year lock-up agreement with the underwriters, these restricted securities may be sold in the future without registration under the securities act to the extent permitted under rule 144 under the securities act. approximately 10,684,448 outstanding shares of these restricted or affiliate securities will be eligible for sale under rule 144 subject to applicable holding period, volume limitations, manner of sale and notice requirements set forth in applicable sec rules and 327,863 shares of the restricted securities will be saleable without regard to these restrictions under rule 144(k). in addition, shareholders holding approximately 10,941,296 outstanding shares of these restricted securities will have registration rights which could allow those holders to sell their shares freely through a registration statement filed under the securities act. moreover, credit suisse first boston llc and bear, stearns & co. inc. may, in their sole discretion and at any time without notice, release these shareholders from the one year lock-up restriction on the sale of their shares. in addition, after this offering, we will have 2,813,955 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our stock option and restricted stock plans, of which options to purchase 103,955 shares were outstanding as of september30, 2003. we intend to file a form s-8 registration statement after this offering to register all of the shares of common stock issuable under our stock option and restricted stock plans.we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock. we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. in addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indenture for the new notes and the new credit facility, will restrict our ability to pay dividends. accordingly, if you purchase shares in this offering, the price of our common stock must appreciate in order to realize a gain on your investment. this may not occur.you will suffer an immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the common stock you purchase. some prior investors have paid substantially less per share than the price in this offering. the initial offering price is expected to be substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of the outstanding common stock immediately after this offering. accordingly, based on the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, purchasers of common stock in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $24.91 per share in net tangible book value of the common stock. in addition, as of september 30, 2003, there were options outstanding to purchase 103,955 shares of common stock, each at an exercise price of $23.53 per share, and warrants to purchase 291,186 shares of common stock, each at an exercise price of $2.94 per share. if all of these options and warrants were exercised on the date of the closing of this offering, investors purchasing shares in this offering would suffer total dilution of $24.56 per share. the figures set forth above include the dilutive effect from the conversion of our preferred stock into 7,654,235 shares of common stock which results in an effective price of $11.63 per share of common stock, which accounts for 42.49% of the per share dilution experienced by purchasers of common stock in this offering (41.58% if all outstanding options and warrants were exercised on the date of closing). we may be limited in our ability to offset future income with our current net operating loss. we have a net operating loss for federal income tax purposes. if we undergo a change of control as described in section 382 of the internal revenue code, our ability to use those net operating losses to offset future income will be limited. this will have the effect of reducing our after tax cashflow. for a more detailed discussion of our potential net operating loss limitation, see united states federal income tax considerations. risks related to our businessour business is subject to general economic and other factors that are largely out of our control and could affect our operations and profitability. our business is dependent on various economic factors over which we have no control, such as the availability of qualified drivers, changes in fuel and insurance prices, including changes in fuel taxes, excess capacity in the trucking industry, changes in license and regulation fees, toll increases, interest rate fluctuations and downturns in customers business cycles and shipping requirements. as a result, we may experience periods of overcapacity, declining prices and lower profit margins in the future. our revenues and operating income could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of increased transportation costs. we have a large number of customers in the chemical processing and consumer goods industries. if these customers experience fluctuations in their business activity due to an economic downturn, work stoppages or other factors over which we have no control, the volume of freight transported by us on behalf of those customers may decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected.loss of affiliates and owner-operators could affect our operations and profitability. we rely on participants in our affiliate program and independent owner-operators. a reduction in the number of affiliates or owner-operators, whether due to capital requirements related to the expense of obtaining, operating and maintaining equipment or for other reasons, could have a negative effect on our operations and profitability. contracts with affiliates typically are for a term ranging from one to five years, and contracts with owner-operators may be terminated by either party on short notice. although affiliates and owner-operators are responsible for paying for their own equipment, fuel and other operating costs, significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek a higher percentage of our revenue if we are unable to increase our rates commensurately. in addition, a continued decline in the rates we pay to our affiliates and owner-operators could adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing affiliates and owner-operators and attract new affiliates, owner-operators and company drivers.increasing trucking regulations may increase costs. as a motor carrier, we are subject to regulation by the u.s. department of transportation and by various state agencies. these regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, financial reporting and certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. there are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours-of-service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size. in addition, our tank wash facilities are subject to strict local, state and federal environmental regulations. interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the department of transportation. to a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to safety and hazardous material transportation regulations that mirror federal regulations. such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are 11 also subject to federal and state regulations. department of transportation regulations mandate drug testing of drivers. to date, the department of transportations national commercial drivers license and alcohol and drug testing requirements have not adversely affected the availability of qualified drivers to us. from time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels. we cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.increased unionization could increase our operating costs or constrain operating flexibility. although only approximately 9% of our total workforce, and only 4% of our driver workforce, including owner operators and employees of affiliates, are currently subject to collective bargaining agreements, unions such as the international brotherhood of teamsters have traditionally been active in the u.s. trucking industry. if our unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, our non-union workforce has been subject to union organization efforts from time to time, and we could be subject to future unionization efforts as our operations expand. increased activity by the teamsters or other unions could increase the possibility for unionization. increased unionization of our workforce could result in higher compensation and working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.operations involving hazardous materials could create environmental liabilities. our activities are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulation by u.s. federal, state, local and canadian governmental authorities. our operations involve the handling, transportation, storage and disposal of bulk liquid chemicals, many of which are classified as hazardous materials, hazardous substances or hazardous waste. our tank wash and terminal operations engage in the storage or discharge of wastewater and storm-water that may have contained hazardous substances, and from time to time, we store diesel fuel and other petroleum products at these terminals. environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable requirements. however, there can be no assurance that material violations of such laws or regulations will not be identified or occur in the future, or that such laws and regulations will not change in a manner that could impose material costs on us. as a handler of hazardous substances, we are potentially subject to strict, joint and several liability for investigating and rectifying the consequences of spills and other environmental releases of these substances either under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980, as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 (cercla) or comparable state laws. from time to time, we have incurred remedial costs and regulatory penalties with respect to chemical or wastewater spills and releases at our facilities, and, notwithstanding the existence of our environmental management program, we cannot assure you that such obligations will not be incurred in the future, or that such liabilities will not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or our business reputation. as a result of environmental studies conducted at our facilities in conjunction with our environmental management program, we have identified environmental contamination at certain sites that will require remediation. we are currently investigating and remediating five properties where we are the only performing party under federal and state superfund programs. each of these five remediation projects relates to operations conducted by clc prior to our acquisition of and merger with clc in 1998. we have also been named as a potentially responsible party, or have otherwise been alleged to have responsibility, under cercla or similar state laws for cleaning up off-site locations where our waste, or material transported by us, has allegedly been disposed. we are currently investigating, remediating, or are subject to potential financial obligations at approximately 37 such waste disposal sites where we are one of several performing parties. we have incurred in 12 the past and expect to continue to incur material expenses for the foreseeable future on environmental matters. as of september 30, 2003, we had reserves in the amount of $30.5 million accrued for our environmental liabilities, including remediation costs. our actual environmental expenditures may exceed our expectations or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.we are self-insured and have exposure to certain claims and the costs of our insurance may not be adequately passed on to our customers. the primary risks associated with our business are bodily injury and property damage, workers compensation claims and cargo loss and damage. we currently maintain liability insurance against (1) bodily injury and property damage and (2) workers compensation claims. this insurance includes deductibles of $5.0million per incident for auto liability and a $1.0 million deductible for workers compensation. as such, we are subject to liability as a self-insurer to the extent of these deductibles under the applicable policy. we are also self-insured for damage to the equipment that we own and lease and for cargo losses, and such self-insurance is not subject to any maximum limitation. we also provide insurance coverage to our affiliates for (a) auto and general liability coverage, subject to a deductible limit for such affiliates of $10,000 or $15,000 per incident and (b)cargo loss and damage, subject to a deductible limit for such affiliates of $5,000 or $7,500 per incident. we are subject to changing conditions and pricing in the insurance marketplace and we cannot assure you that the cost or availability of various types of insurance may not change dramatically in the future. to the extent these costs can not be passed on to our customers in increased freight rates, increases in insurance costs could reduce our future profitability.the issuance of preferred stock in the company could adversely affect the market value of our common stock and diminish the voting power of the owners of our common stock. we do not currently intend to issue preferred stock. however, our amended and restated articles of incorporation and by-laws will permit the issuance of preferred stock which, due to their preferential treatment with respect to dividends and voting rights, could lead to a decrease in the price of our common stock and would, in certain situations, diminish the voting power of the holders of our common stock.the loss of one or more significant customers may adversely affect our business. we are dependent upon a limited number of large customers. our top ten customers accounted for approximately 30.8% of our total revenues during 2002. in particular, our largest customer, the dow chemical company, accounted for 12.6% of our total revenues during 2002. the loss of the dow chemical company or one or more of our other major customers, or a material reduction in services performed for such customers, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.our business may be harmed by terrorist attacks, future war or anti-terrorism measures. in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and are implementing various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. such measures may have costs associated with them which a motor carrier is forced to bear. in addition, war or risk of war may also have an adverse effect on the economy. a decline in economic activity could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital. in addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverages currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or such coverages could be unavailable in the future.loss of qualified personnel could limit our growth and negatively affect operations. there is substantial competition for qualified personnel, including drivers, in the trucking industry. furthermore, certain geographic areas have a greater shortage of qualified drivers than other areas. we operate in 13 many of these geographic areas where there is a shortage of drivers. difficulty in attracting qualified personnel, particularly qualified drivers, could require us to limit our growth and could have a negative impact on our operations. in addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain qualified personnel in the future.we depend on members of our senior management. we believe that our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to operate profitably depends in large part on the continued employment of our senior management team led by thomas l. finkbiner. if mr. finkbiner or the other members of senior management become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business or financial results could be adversely affected. although we have entered into employment agreements with certain members of our senior management team, each of these agreements has a two-year initial term, subject to automatic one-year extensions unless prior notice is given by either party. the initial term of some of these agreements has expired, and such agreements are now subject to the one-year extension provision. we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew or extend these employment agreements.our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities. we are highly leveraged. as of september 30, 2003, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the transaction, our consolidated indebtedness would have been $272.8 million, consisting principally of obligations under the unsecured new notes and the secured new credit facility. in addition to the amount then outstanding, we could have borrowed an additional $63.8 million under the new credit facility (net of outstanding letters of credit). following the transaction, we will continue to have the ability to incur new debt, subject to limitations in the new credit facility and the indenture governing the new notes. our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including the following: our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms; we will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness, including indebtedness that we may incur in the future; payments on our indebtedness will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for our operations and future business opportunities; a substantial decrease in our net operating cash flows could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and force us to modify our operations; we may be more highly leveraged than our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; our debt level may make us more vulnerable than our competitors to a downturn in our business or the economy generally; our debt level reduces our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions; and some of our debt has a variable rate of interest, which increases our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations.</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS Before you invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the various risks, including those described below, together with all of the other information included in this prospectus. Risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could cause our sales revenues to decreaseOur sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we were to lose one or more of these customers, or if one or more of these customers were to delay or reduce purchases of our products, our sales revenues may decrease. For the six months ended June 30, 1999, approximately 81% of our revenues were generated by five of our customers, and revenues derived from sales to Talent Trade Asia, TriGem and Silicon Application Corporation accounted for 42%, 20% and 10%, respectively, of our product sales. For the year ended December 31, 1998, approximately 60% of our revenues were generated by five of our customers, and revenues derived from sales to Silicon Application Corporation, BTC, Askey Computer and Zoltrix accounted for 15%, 13%, 12% and 12%, respectively, of our product sales. These customers may in the future decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns, because: . we do not have any long-term purchase arrangements or contracts with these or any of our other customers, . our product sales to date have been made primarily on a purchase order basis, which permit our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice and without penalty, and . many of our customers also have pre-existing relationships with current or potential competitors which may affect our customers' purchasing decisionsWe expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next 12 to 18 months and that a significant portion of our sales will continue to be made on the basis of purchase orders. We have significant sales and operations concentrated in Asia. Continued political and economic instability in Asia and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase market demand for our productsOur sales to customers located in Asia accounted for 74%, 77% and 76% of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively, and 77% and 99% of total revenues in the six months ended June 30, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The predominance of our sales are in Asia, mostly in Taiwan and China, because our customers are primarily motherboard or modem manufacturers that are located there. In many cases, our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers specify that our products be included on the modem boards or motherboards, the main printed circuit board containing the central processing unit of a computer system, that they purchase from board manufacturers, and we sell our products directly to the board manufacturers for resale to our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers. Industry statistics indicate that approximately two thirds of modems manufactured in Asia are sold back to original equipment manufacturers located in the United States. Due to the industry-wide concentration of modem manufacturers in Asia, we believe 7 that a high percentage of our future sales will continue to be concentrated with Asian customers. As a result, our future operating results could be uniquely affected by a variety of factors outside of our control, including: . political and economic instability, such as the recent political instability in Indonesia and the economic turmoil in Japan, . changes in tariffs, quotas, import restrictions and other trade barriers which may make our products more expensive compared to our competitors, . delays in collecting accounts receivable, which we have experienced from time to time, and . fluctuations in the value of Asian currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which may make it more costly for us to do business in Asia which may in turn make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our revenuesTo successfully expand our sales in Asia and internationally, we must strengthen foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international distributors and resellers. This will require significant management attention and financial resources. To the extent that we are unable to effect these additions in a timely manner, we may not be able to maintain or increase market demand for our products in Asia and internationally, and our operating results could be hurt. The recent earthquake in Taiwan and subsequent aftershocks may cause our revenues or profitability to decreaseBecause our products are sold to motherboard or modem manufacturer customers in Taiwan, the recent earthquake in Taiwan may result in less demand for our products and may cause our revenues to decrease. Our customers who are outside of Taiwan may also be dependent on other components manufactured in Taiwan. The recent earthquake may disrupt the operations of our customers' other suppliers who are located in Taiwan, and may result in a decrease in demand of our products. We are also dependent on our suppliers who manufacture product components in Taiwan. The recent earthquake may disrupt the operations of these suppliers. If they are not able to adequately supply us, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products. We do not currently believe that the effect of this earthquake on our business will be material. However, due to the nature of this disaster and the fact that its full impact on our business has not been fully evaluated, our sales to customers in Asia may be affected in the next few quarters. Continuing decreases in the average selling prices of our products could result in decreased revenuesProduct sales in the connectivity industry have been characterized by continuing erosion of average selling prices. Price erosion experienced by any company can cause revenues and gross margins to decline. The average selling price of our products has decreased by approximately 40% from October 1995 to June 30, 1999. We expect this trend to continueIn addition, we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards in the soft modem industry is likely to further erode average selling prices, particularly for analog modems. Adoption of industry standards is driven by the market requirement to have interoperable modems. End users need this interoperability to ensure modems from different manufacturers communicate with each other without problems. Historically, users have deferred purchasing modems until these industry standards are adopted. However, once these standards are accepted, it lowers the barriers to entry and price erosion has resulted. Decreasing average selling prices in our products could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units that we sell increases. Therefore, we must continue to develop and introduce next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins. Our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margin to decline. Our gross margins may vary based on the mix of sales of our products and services, and these variations may hurt our net incomeWe derive a significant portion of our sales from our software-based connectivity products. We expect margins on newly introduced products generally to be higher than our existing products. However, due in part to 8 the competitive pricing pressures that affect our products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs, we expect margins from both existing and future products to decrease over time. In addition, licensing revenues from our products historically have provided higher margins than of our product sales. Changes in the mix of products sold and the percentage of our sales in any quarter attributable to products as compared to licensing revenues will cause our quarterly results to vary and could result in a decrease in net income. Our revenues may fluctuate each quarter due to both domestic and international seasonal trendsWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in sales of our connectivity products. These seasonal trends materially affect our quarter-to-quarter operating results. Our revenues are higher during the back- to-school and holiday seasons which fall in the third and fourth calendar quarters. Revenue in our third and fourth quarters are typically higher relative to other quarters because many purchasers of PCs make purchase decisions based on their calendar year-end budgeting requirements. As a result, we generally expect revenue levels for the first quarter to be less than those for the preceding quarterWe are currently expanding our sales in international markets, particularly in Asia, Europe and South America. We expect our third quarter to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity and spending activity generally associated with that time of year, particularly in Europe. To the extent that our revenues in Asia, Europe or other parts of the world increase in future periods, we expect our period-to-period revenues to reflect seasonal buying patterns in these markets. Any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in customers cancelling purchases of our productsSales cycles for our products with major customers are lengthy, often lasting six months or longer. In addition, it can take an additional six months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products. Sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons: . our original equipment manufacturer customers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products, over which we have no control, before placing a purchase order, . the commercial integration of our products by an original equipment manufacturer is typically limited during the initial release to evaluate product performance, and . the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayedA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders. The lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases. If customer cancellations or product changes were to occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses. We expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future and these increased expenses may diminish our ability to remain profitableAlthough we have been profitable in recent years, we may not remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially over at least the next three years as we: . further develop and introduce new applications and functionality for our host signal processing technology, . explore emerging product opportunities in digital technologies and wireless and cable communications, . expand our distribution channels, both domestically and in our international markets, and . pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions. 9 In order to maintain profitability we will be required to increase our revenues to meet these additional expenses. Any failure to significantly increase our revenues as we implement our product, service, distribution and strategic relationship strategies would result in a decrease in our overall revenuesTo date, we have principally relied upon our distributor sales organization for product sales to smaller accounts. Our direct sales efforts have focused principally on board manufacturers and smaller PC original equipment manufacturers. To increase penetration of our target customer base, including large, tier-one original equipment manufacturers, we must significantly increase the size of our direct sales force and organize and deploy sales teams targeted at specific domestic tier-one original equipment manufacturer accounts. If we are unable to expand our sales to additional original equipment manufacturers, our revenues may not meet analysts' expectations which could cause our stock price to drop. We must accurately forecast our customer demand for our modem products. If there is an unexpected fluctuation in demand for our products, we may incur excessive operating costs or lose product revenuesWe must forecast and place purchase orders for specialized semiconductor chips, the application specific integrated circuit, coder/decoder and discrete access array, or data access arrangement, components of our modem products, several months before we receive purchase orders from our own customers. This forecasting and order lead time requirement limits our ability to react to unexpected fluctuations in demand for our products. These fluctuations can be unexpected and may cause us to have excess inventory, or a shortage, of a particular product. In the event that our forecasts are inaccurate, we may need to write down excess inventory. For example, we were required to write down inventory in the second quarter of 1996 in connection with a product transition within our 14.4 Kbps product family. Similarly, if we fail to purchase sufficient supplies on a timely basis, we may incur additional rush charges or we may lose product revenues if we are not able to meet a purchase order. These failures could also adversely affect our customer relations. Significant write- downs of excess inventory or declines in inventory value in the future could cause our net income and gross margin to decrease. We rely heavily on our intellectual property rights which offer only limited protection against potential infringers. Unauthorized use of our technology may result in development of products that compete with our products which could cause our market share and our revenues to be reducedOur success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. These means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate. We hold a total of 32 patents, a number of which cover technology that is considered essential for International Telecommunications Union standard communications solutions, and also have 26 additional patent applications pending or filed. These patents may never be issued. These patents, both issued and pending, may not provide sufficiently broad protection against third party infringement lawsuits or they may not prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Other than the Motorola and ESS lawsuits described elsewhere in this prospectus, to date, no material lawsuits relating to intellectual property have been filed against usDespite precautions that we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may provide our licensees with access to our proprietary information underlying our licensed applications. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology. Finally, policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and some foreign laws, including those of various countries in Asia, do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as United States laws. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resourcesWe have received, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. These claims could affect our relationships with existing customers and may prevent potential future customers from purchasing our products or licensing our 10 technology. Because we depend upon a limited number of products, any claims of this kind, whether they are with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In the event that we do not prevail in litigation, we could be prevented from selling our products or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms which may not be acceptable to us. We could also be prevented from selling our products or be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Should we cross license our intellectual property in order to obtain licenses, we may no longer be able to offer a unique productNew patent applications may be currently pending or filed in the future by third parties covering technology that we use currently or may use in the future. Pending U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents are issued, and thus it is impossible to ascertain all possible patent infringement claims against us. We believe that several of our competitors, including Motorola, Lucent and ESS Technology, may have a strategy of protecting their market share by filing intellectual property claims against their competitors and may assert claims against us in the future. The legal and other expenses and diversion of resources associated with any such litigation could result in a decrease in our revenuesIn addition, some of our customer agreements include an indemnity clause that obligates us to defend and pay all damages and costs finally awarded by a court should third parties assert patent and/or copyright claims against our customers. As a result, we may be held responsible for infringement claims asserted against our customers. If our financial reserves for potential future license fees are less than any actual fees that we are required to pay, our net income would be reducedWe have established and recorded on a monthly basis a financial per-unit reserve for payment of future license fees based upon our estimate as to the likely amount of the licensing fees that we may be required to pay in the event that licenses are obtained. We believe that it is typical for participants in the modem industry to obtain licenses in exchange for grants of cross licenses rather than for payment of fees and we have based our estimates on our understanding of the license fee practices of other segments of our industry. Our reserves may not be adequate because of factors outside of our control and because these license fee practices in the modern industry may not be applicable to our experience. Competition in the connectivity market is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for, or the prices of, our products may be reducedThe connectivity device market is intensely competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors. Our current competitors include 3Com, Conexant, ESS Technology, Lucent Technologies and Motorola. Motorola introduced soft modems in the third quarter of 1998 and Conexant introduced soft modems in the fourth quarter of 1998. We expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors enhance their product offerings, new suppliers enter the connectivity device market, new communication technologies are introduced and additional networks are deployedWe may in the future also face competition from other suppliers of products based on host signal processing technology or on new or emerging communication technologies, which may render our existing or future products obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. We believe that these competitors may include Alcatel, Analog Devices, Aware, Broadcom, Com21, Efficient Networks, Orckit, Terayon Communications and Texas InstrumentsWe believe that the principal competitive factors required by users and customers in the connectivity product market include compatibility with industry standards, price, functionality, ease of use and customer service and support. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. 11 We recently hired a new President and Chief Operating Officer. If he is not successful in carrying out his duties, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability or increase our revenueIn August 1999, we hired William F. Roach as our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Roach must be successfully integrated into our organizational structure. If for any reason Mr. Roach does not successfully carry out his duties or lead our organization in an effective manner, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability or increase our revenue. In order for us to maintain our profitability and continue to introduce and develop new products for emerging markets, we must attract and retain our executive officers and qualified technical, sales, support and other administrative personnelOur past performance has been and our future performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive officers and certain key engineering, sales, marketing, financial, technical and customer support personnel. If we lost the services of one or more of our executives or key employees, a replacement could be difficult to recruit and we may not be able to grow our businessWe maintain "key person" life insurance policies on Peter Chen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, William Wen-Liang Hsu, our Vice President, Engineering, and Han Yeh, our Vice President, Technology, in the face amount of $1 million for each individual. However, these insurance policies may not adequately compensate for the loss of services of any of these individualsWe intend to hire a significant number of additional engineering, sales, support, marketing and finance personnel in the future. Competition for personnel, especially engineers and marketing and sales personnel in Silicon Valley, is intense. We are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education, backgrounds and industry experience. As of June 30, 1999, we employed a total of 58 people in our engineering department, over half of whom have advanced degrees. In the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified engineering personnel, especially developers, on a timely basis. If we are not able to hire at the levels that we plan, our ability to continue to develop products and technologies responsive to our markets will be impaired. We have experienced significant growth in our business in recent periods and failure to manage our growth could strain our management, financial and administrative resourcesOur ability to successfully sell our products and implement our business plan in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective management planning process. Future expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on our management by significantly increasing the scope of their responsibilities and resources by increasing the number of people using them. We have increased, and plan to continue to increase, the scope of our operations at a rapid rate. Our headcount has grown and will continue to grow substantially. At December 31, 1998, we had a total of 95 employees and at June 30, 1999, we had a total of 125 employees. In addition, we expect to continue to hire a significant number of new employees. To effectively manage our growth, we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls, integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. We rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test our products. If these companies do not meet their commitments to us, our ability to sell products to our customers would be impairedWe do not have our own manufacturing, assembling or testing operations. Instead, we rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test the semiconductor chips which are integral components of our products. Most of these companies are located outside of the United States. There are many risks associated with our relationships with these independent companies, including reduced control over: . delivery schedules, . quality assurance, 12 . manufacturing costs, . capacity during periods of excess demand, and . availability of access to process technologiesIn addition, the location of these independent parties outside of the United States creates additional risks resulting from the foreign regulatory, political and economic environments in which each of these companies exists. While to date we have not experienced any material problems, failures or delays by our manufacturers to provide the semiconductor chips that we require for our products, or any material change in the financial arrangements we have with these companies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer product requirementsWe design, market and sell application specific integrated circuits and outsource the manufacturing and assembly of the integrated circuits to a third party fabrication. The majority of our products and related components are manufactured by five principal companies: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, ST Microelectronics, Kawasaki/LSI, Silicon Labs and Delta Integration. We expect to continue to rely upon these third parties for these services. Currently, the data access arrangement chips used in our soft modem products are provided by a sole source, Silicon Labs, on a purchase order basis, and we have only a limited guaranteed supply arrangement under a contract with our supplier. We are currently in the process of qualifying a second source for our data access arrangement chips. Although we believe that we would be able to qualify an alternative manufacturing source for data access arrangement chips within a relatively short period of time, this transition, if necessary, could result in loss of purchase orders or customer relationships, which could result in decreased revenues. Undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance of our productsOur products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released. To date, we have not been made aware of any significant software errors or failures in our products. However, despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance. If we, our key suppliers or our customers fail to be ready for the year 2000 calendar change, our business may be disrupted and our net revenues may declineThe Year 2000 issue refers to computer programs which use two digits rather than four to define a given year and which might read a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the Year 2000. As a result, many companies' systems and software may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to function correctly after December 31, 1999Our Software. Our connectivity products are incorporated into computer products of our customers which may not be Year 2000 compliant, or which may be perceived by their markets as not meeting Year 2000 compliance requirements. As a result, it is likely that any failure of the computer products into which our products may be incorporated to be Year 2000 compliant, or any slowdown in the connectivity markets as a result of Year 2000 compliance concerns, will hurt our product sales. In addition, we believe that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by Year 2000 issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or upgrade their current software systems for Year 2000 compliance. These expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase our products. To the extent Year 2000 issues cause a significant delay in, or cancellation of, decisions to purchase our products or services, our business would suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we test and evaluate our software modems. We believe that our current products are Year 2000 compliant, meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after January 1, 2000 will not materially affect the performance of our software products or the ability of our products to transmit data involving dates. 13 Third Party Equipment And Software. We use third party equipment and software that may not be Year 2000 compliant. This equipment and software includes our key internal systems such as for our internal accounting systems or controls. If this equipment or software does not operate properly with regard to the Year 2000, we may incur unexpected expenses to remedy any problems. These costs may materially adversely affect our business. In addition, if our key internal systems fail as a result of Year 2000 problems, we could incur substantial costs and disruption of our businessCompliance. Despite our current assessment, we may not identify and correct all significant Year 2000 problems on a timely basis. Year 2000 compliance efforts may involve significant time and expense and unremediated problems could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We currently do not have any estimate of potential costs related to potential Year 2000 problems. We currently do not have plans to contact our material customers. We currently have no contingency plans to address the risks associated with unremediated Year 2000 problems. To date, we have not incurred any material costs directly associated with Year 2000 compliance efforts, except for compensation expense associated with salaried employees who have devoted some of their time to Year 2000 assessment and remediation efforts. We do not expect the total cost of Year 2000 problems to be material to our business, financial condition or operating results. However, during the months prior to the century change, we will continue to evaluate new versions of our products, new software and information systems provided by third parties and any new infrastructure systems that we acquire, to determine whether they are Year 2000 compliant. Risks Related to Our Industry If the market for applications using our host signal processing technology does not grow as we anticipate, or if our products are not accepted in this market, our revenues may stagnate and may decreaseOur success depends on the growth of the market for applications using our host signal processing technology. This market has only recently begun to develop and may not develop at the growth rates that have been suggested by industry estimates. Market demand for host signal processing technology depends primarily upon the cost and performance benefits relative to other competing solutions. For example, soft modems have only recently begun to gain acceptance in the modem market. Although we have shipped a significant number of soft modems since we began commercial sales of these products in October 1995, the current level of demand for soft modems may not be sustained or may not grow. If customers do not accept soft modems or the market for soft modems does not grow, our revenues will decreaseFurther, we are in the process of developing next generation products and applications which improve and extend upon our host signal processing technology, such as a G.Lite modem solution, an external modem product and a remote access solution. If these products are not accepted in our markets when they are introduced, our revenues and profitability will be negatively affected. Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies. If we do not adapt to these technologies, our products will become obsoleteThe connectivity product mark</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all of the other information included in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any of the following risks could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate or materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition and could result in a complete loss of your investment. Risks Related to our Business We are not profitable and do not expect to achieve profitability in the near future, if at allWe have not achieved profitability. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We incurred net losses of $321,000 from inception through December 31, 1997. For the year ended December 31, 1998, we incurred additional net losses of $5.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, we incurred additional net losses of $16.0 million and had an accumulated deficit of $21.6 million as of September 30, 1999, and we expect to report additional net losses for the period since September 30, 1999Our business plan calls for us to continue to acquire and invest in operating companies. As a result, we will continue to amortize substantial amounts of goodwill. As we grow, we expect that the amount of goodwill we will amortize in connection with these investments will represent an increasingly smaller portion of our expenses. Therefore, we expect to continue to incur net losses until that point in time when the goodwill we amortize represents a sufficiently small amount of our expenses that it is exceeded by our net income before amortization. Because we cannot predict the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we do not know when we will become profitable, if ever. We have a history of negative cash flow, and we may never achieve positive cash flowFor the year ended December 31, 1998, we had losses from operations, before depreciation and amortization, of $4.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, we had losses from operations, before depreciation and amortization, of $9.0 million, and we expect to report additional losses for the period since September 30, 1999. Additionally, we used $14.3 million in 1998 and $61.3 million in the first nine months of 1999 to acquire operations and fixed assets. If we are unable to increase our revenue to cover our costs and investment expenditures, we will continue to experience negative cash flow. For information regarding our expected losses for the three months ended December 31, 1999, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis--Recent Developments" on page 24. We may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to execute our business planWe expect that the net proceeds of this offering will fund our operations for the next 12 months. After we have used the net proceeds from this offering, we will need to obtain additional debt or equity financings to fund operations, capital expenditures for expansion of network and information systems, and acquisitions. If we obtain debt financings, we may be required to agree to restrictions on our activities that could impair our ability to execute our business plan. For example, these restrictions may prohibit us from incurring additional debt or making acquisitions without prior lender approval. If we obtain additional equity financings, the per share value of our outstanding common stock may be diluted. In general, if we are unable to obtain these financings on favorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plan. Our combined operating history is limited and may not be indicative of our future performanceAlthough a number of the operating companies we have acquired have been in operation for some time, VIA itself has a limited history of operations. Consequently, the financial information in this prospectus may not be indicative of our future performance. 6 Because we have grown rapidly and we expect our growth to continue, we may have difficulty managing our growth effectively, which could adversely affect the quality of our services and the results of our operationsWe have grown rapidly and expect to continue to grow rapidly by acquiring new companies, increasing the number of customers served and increasing the number and types of products and services we offer. We have acquired 19 companies since June 1998, and agreed to acquire one other company, and the total number of our employees grew from five to 903 between June 1, 1998 and January 14, 2000. To manage our expected growth effectively, we must . implement additional management information systems . develop additional operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls . hire and train additional personnelIf we are unable to meet these demands, the quality of our services may suffer, causing us to lose customers and revenues. If we fail to integrate operating systems, networks and management of our acquired companies successfully, we may suffer operating inefficiencies and reduced operating cash flow We may not be able to integrate our acquired companies successfully because we currently operate in 12 different countries with different governmental regulations, languages, customs, currencies and availabilities of telecommunication capacity to carry data. We will have to commit substantial management, operating, financial and other resources to integrate our operating companies and implement our business model, which will reduce our operating cash flow. Because we operate in markets where extended vacations are typical, and since in some of these markets, we receive a portion of our revenues based on customer usage, we may experience seasonal variation in our quarterly revenue and operating results that could cause our stock price to declineIn Europe and Latin America, four or more weeks of vacation is typical and often mandated under law. As a result, extended summer and winter holiday vacations are common and it is difficult to attract new customers during these periods. In these markets, our customers also pay their telephone companies for the number of minutes they spend on-line, even if we provide a local telephone number that they can use for access. We may receive a portion of these fees from the telephone companies as payment for generating usage, and customer usage generally declines in the summer months, July and August in Europe and January and February in Latin America, and in December. As a result, we may experience lower revenues during these periods and our operating results may be affected. To the extent our quarterly results fluctuate more widely than expected by us, securities analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. We face increasing competition for the purchase of local Internet services providers, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitionsOur business strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to identify and acquire new local Internet services providers that meet our acquisition criteria. In pursuing these opportunities, we compete with other Internet services providers, local, regional, national and global telecommunication companies and other buyers. These competitors may drive up the price of our acquisition targets or may acquire our acquisition targets. Many of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than we have. Increasing competition has raised the price we have paid for acquisitions in some markets and may continue to do so. In addition, our acquisition targets may find our competitors more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. 7 Financial information on which we rely to make future acquisitions may not be accurate, which may result in our acquiring undisclosed liabilities or experiencing lower than expected operating resultsThe companies we target for acquisition typically do not have audited financial statements and have varying degrees of internal controls and detailed financial information. As a result, we may acquire undisclosed liabilities or experience lower-than-expected revenues or higher-than-expected costs, which could adversely affect our operating results. To date, no issues of this kind have arisen that have materially adversely affected our results; however, they may arise in the future. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the various currencies in which we conduct business may affect our operating resultsWe record the revenues and expenses of our local operations in their home currencies and translate these amounts into U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues, expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations may adversely affect the comparability of period-to-period results. For example, the value of the Brazilian Real fluctuated by 45.6% in relation to the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and ended the period 37.2% lower than its value to the U.S. dollar in the beginning of the year. Since each Real converted to fewer U.S. dollars, our U.S. dollar revenue was reduced. In the past, the currencies of many Latin American countries, including Brazil and Mexico in particular, have experienced substantial devaluation and volatility. Our Latin American markets have a history of political and economic instability which may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our resultsWe derive and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from the Latin American markets. Latin America has experienced periods of political and economic instability. If these conditions were to reoccur, our business could be adversely affected. Historically, instability in Latin American countries has been caused by . extensive governmental involvement, control or ownership of industries in local economies, including telecommunications facilities, financial institutions and other commerce infrastructure . unexpected changes in regulatory requirements such as imposing licensing requirements or levying new taxes . slow or negative growth as a result of recessionary trends caused by foreign currency devaluations, interest rate hikes and inflation . imposition of trade barriers through trade restrictions, high tariffs and taxes . wage and price controls that reduce potential profitability of businesses Any occurrence of adverse political and economic conditions may deter growth in Internet usage or create uncertainty regarding our operating climate, which my adversely impact our business. Currently, we do not have political risk insurance to guard against business interruptions and other losses caused by political acts. Logistical problems or economic downturns that could result from the introduction of the Euro may affect our ability to operate and adversely impact our operating resultsOn January 1, 1999, 11 of the 15 European Union member countries adopted the Euro as their common legal currency, at which time their respective individual currencies became fixed at a rate of exchange to the Euro, and the Euro became a currency in its own right. During a January 1, 1999 to January 1, 2002 transition period, we must manage transactions with our customers and our third-party vendors who conduct business in Euro participating countries in both the Euro and the individual currencies. If we, our customers or our vendors experience systems problems in converting to the Euro, we could be unable to bill and collect from customers or pay vendors for services, and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. 8The establishment of the European Monetary Union may have a significant effect on the economies of the participant countries. Since a substantial portion of our revenue will be denominated in the Euro or currencies of European Union countries, our operating results could be adversely affected if there is a downturn in the economies of participating countries or if the Euro weakens against other currencies. Our brand names are difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third partiesWe are aware of other companies using or claiming to have rights to use our trademarks and variations of those marks, including the VIA NET.WORKS mark. In particular, one company has notified us that it believes our use of the VIA NET.WORKS mark in Brazil infringes upon its trademark applications. The users of these or similar marks may be found to have senior rights if they were ever to assert a claim against us for trademark infringement. If an infringement suit were instituted against us, even if groundless, it could result in substantial litigation expenses in defending the suit. If such a suit were to be successful, we could be forced to cease using the mark and to pay damagesWe have applied to register several of our trademarks in various countries. Our application to register in Argentina the trademark "VIA Net Works Argentina" has been opposed by a third party. If any of our applications are unsuccessful, we may be required to discontinue the use of those trademarks. Risks Related to our Industry Regulatory and economic conditions of the countries where our operating companies are located are uncertain and may decrease demand for our services, increase our cost of doing business or otherwise reduce our business prospectsOur operating companies are located in countries with rapidly changing regulatory and economic conditions which may affect the Internet services industry. Any new law or regulation pertaining to the Internet or telecommunications, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, could decrease demand for our services, increase our costs or otherwise reduce our profitability or business prospects. Specific examples of the types of laws or regulations that could adversely affect us include laws that . impose taxes on transactions made over the Internet . impose telecommunications access fees on Internet services providers . directly or indirectly affect telecommunications costs generally or the costs of Internet telecommunications specifically . prohibit the transmission over the Internet of various types of information and content . impose requirements on Internet services providers to protect Internet users' privacy or to permit government interception of data traffic . increase the likelihood or scope of competition from telecommunications or cable companiesFor example, some states of Brazil impose a tax of up to 30% on revenues generated by communications services. There has been no judicial determination that Internet access services constitute communications services. If Internet services providers are ultimately required to pay this tax, our Brazilian operations would be negatively and significantly impactedThese laws could require us to incur costs to comply with them or to incur new liability. They could also increase our competition or change our competitive environment so that customer demand for our products and services is affected. For a discussion of specific regulatory proposals that may affect our business, see "Business--Regulatory Matters."In addition to risks we face from new laws or regulations, we face uncertainties in connection with the application of existing laws to the Internet. It may take years to determine the manner in which existing laws 9 governing issues like property ownership, libel, negligence and personal privacy will be applied to communications and commerce over the Internet. Increasing competition for customers in our markets may cause us to reduce our prices or increase spending, which may negatively affect our revenues and operating resultsThere are competitors in our markets with more significant market presence and brand recognition and greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. As a result of this competition, we currently face and expect to continue to face significant pressure to reduce our prices and improve the products and services we offer. Although the competitors we face vary depending on the market and the country, these competitors may include local and regional Internet services providers, telecommunication companies and cable companies. Some of our competitors, especially the telecommunications companies, have large networks in place as well as a significant existing customer base. If demand for Internet services in our markets does not grow as we expect, our ability to grow our revenues will be negatively affectedInternet use in our markets is relatively low. If the market for Internet services fails to develop, or develops more slowly than expected, we may not be able to increase our revenues. Obstacles to the development of Internet services in our markets include: . low rates of personal computer ownership and usage . lack of developed infrastructure to develop Internet access and applications . limited access to Internet servicesIn particular, we depend on increasing demand for Internet services by small to mid-sized businesses in our geographic markets. Demand for Internet services by these businesses will depend partly on the degree to which these businesses' customers and suppliers adopt the Internet as a means of doing business, and partly on the extent to which these businesses adopt Internet technologies to deal with internal business processes, such as internal communications. We are in a rapidly evolving industry in which the products and services we offer, their methods of delivery and their underlying technologies are changing rapidly, and if we do not keep pace with these changes, we may fail to retain and attract customers, which would reduce our revenuesThe Internet services market is characterized by changing customer needs, frequent new service and product introductions, evolving industry standards and rapidly changing technology. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to recognize and respond to these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we fail to do so, we will not be able to compete successfully. We rely on telecommunications companies in our markets to provide our customers with reliable access to our services, and failures or delays in providing access could limit our ability to service our customers and impact our revenues and operating resultsOur customers access our services either through their normal telephone lines or dedicated lines provided by local telecommunications companies specifically for that use. In some of our markets, we experience delays in delivery of new telephone lines that have prevented our customers from accessing our services. These delays result in lost revenues. Additionally, some local telecommunications companies that provide Internet services provide delivery of telephone or dedicated lines to their Internet customers on a preferential basis, which may cause us to lose current and potential customers. We also lease network capacity from telecommunications companies and rely on the quality and availability of their service. These companies may experience disruptions of service which could disrupt our services to, or limit Internet access for, our customers. We may 10 not be able to replace or supplement these services on a timely basis or in a cost-effective manner, which may result in customer dissatisfaction and lost revenues. We depend on the reliability of our network, and a system failure or a breach of our security measures could result in a loss of customers and reduced revenuesWe are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damages from telecommunication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters and unauthorized access. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could impair our ability to provide Internet services to our customers and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers' data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches. Although we currently possess errors and omissions insurance and business interruption insurance, these policies may not provide effective coverage upon the occurrence of all events. We do not have insurance specifically to guard against losses resulting from computer viruses and security breaches. If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or lose the services of our key personnel, our operating results may sufferOur success depends on our key management, engineers, sales and marketing personnel, technical support representatives and other personnel, many of whom may be difficult to replace. If we lose key personnel, we may not be able to find suitable replacements, which may negatively affect our business. In addition, since the demand for qualified personnel in our industry is very high, we may have to increase the salaries and fringe benefits we may offer to our personnel, which may affect our operating results. We do not maintain key person life insurance on, or restrictive employment agreements with, any of our executive officers. We may be liable for information disseminated over our networkWe may face liability for information carried on or disseminated through our network. Some types of laws that may result in our liability for information disseminated over our network include: . laws designed to protect intellectual property, including trademark and copyright laws . laws relating to publicity and privacy rights and laws prohibiting defamation . laws restricting the collection, use and processing of personal data and . laws prohibiting the sale, dissemination or possession of pornographic materialThe laws governing these matters vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For information about the applicable laws that may affect our liability for information carried or disseminated through our network, see "Business-- Regulatory Matters." The availability of protection for intellectual property rights in the context of the Internet remains uncertain We rely on trademark and copyright law, laws restricting unfair trade practices, laws relating to trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. The applicability and enforceability of legal principles concerning intellectual property rights in an Internet context remains substantially uncertain as the courts and legislatures in each country in which we operate continue to address the issues. Substantially all of the countries in which we operate are signatories to the same international treaties relating to the protection of intellectual property to which the United States adheres. Nonetheless, in many of these countries, the courts have not had the opportunity to address the legal issues within the Internet context to the same degree as U.S. courts. It is therefore uncertain whether the intellectual property of our non-U.S. operations will be subject to a lesser or different degree of protection than that generally afforded in the United States. 11 The Year 2000 issue could impair our ability to provide services to our customers, increase our costs, or reduce our revenues or profitabilityYear 2000 issues may adversely affect our business and our customers' businesses. Many computer systems may fail or malfunction because they are unable to distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates. We have incurred costs to upgrade our computers to address the year 2000 issue and may in the future incur additional costs. Our customers may also need to incur costs to either upgrade their computers or correct any problems their computers may encounter, which may reduce our revenues by diverting our customers' information systems resources away from our products and services. In addition, if our computer systems or those of our telecommunications suppliers fail or malfunction as a result of Year 2000 issues, our ability to provide services to our customers will be disrupted, which could result in lost revenues, lost customers or claims for damages, which could lead to costly litigation. For information on how we are addressing year 2000 issues, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure." Risks Related to this Offering We have discretion over the use of all of the net proceeds from this offering and may fail to use them effectively to grow our businessWe will retain discretion over how to use the net proceeds of this offering. Because the proceeds are not required to be allocated to any specific investment or transaction, you will not be able to determine at this time the value or appropriateness of our use of the proceeds. You will pay a higher price for our common stock than was paid by existing stockholders and will experience immediate and substantial dilutionIf you purchase common stock in this offering, you will pay more for your shares than the amounts paid by existing stockholders for their shares. As a result, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $14.54 per share, and our existing stockholders will experience an unrealized gain of $195.6 million in the aggregate. 42,068,821, or 73.7%, of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future. These sales could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing wellAfter this offering, we will have outstanding 57,068,821 shares of common stock, based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on January 14, 2000. This amount includes the 15,000,000 shares we are selling in this offering, which may be resold in the public market immediately. The remaining 73.7%, or 42,068,821 shares, of our total outstanding shares will become available for resale in the public market, subject to restrictions under federal securities laws, as shown in the chart below. For information regarding these restrictions, see "Shares Eligible for Future Sale."As restrictions on resale end, the market price could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. &lt;TABLE&gt; &lt;CAPTION&gt; Number of shares/ % of total outstanding Date of availability for resale into public market ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------- &lt;S&gt; &lt;C&gt; 41,613,184/ 180 days after the date of this prospectus due to an 72.9% agreement these stockholders have agreed to deliver to the underwriters. However, the underwriters can waive this restriction and allow these stockholders to sell their shares at any time. 455,637/ Between 90 and 365 days after the date of this 0.8% prospectus due to the requirements of the federal securities laws. &lt;/TABLE&gt; 12In addition, holders of approximately 41,340,721 shares of common stock and non-voting common stock will be entitled to registration rights with respect to their common stock. If these holders exercise their registration rights, causing a large number of shares to be sold in the public market, our market price may drop significantly. Our stock has not traded publicly and may not trade actively after this offeringPrior to this offering, you could not buy or sell our common stock publicly. We cannot assure you that an active public trading market for our stock will develop or be sustained after this offering. The market price of our common stock, like the market prices of stocks of other Internet-related and technology companies, may fluctuate widely and rapidlyThe securities of many companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, often unrelated to the companies' operating performance. Specifically, market prices for securities of Internet-related and technology companies have frequently reached elevated levels following their initial public offerings. These levels may be unsustainable and may not bear any relationship to these companies' operating performances. If the market price of our common stock reaches an elevated level following this offering, it may materially and rapidly decline. Fluctuations in our common stock's market price may affect our visibility and credibility in the Internet services provider marketIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company. If we were to become involved in a class action suit, it could be costly and divert the attention of management. Furthermore, if adversely determined, a class action suit may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The price per share of our common stock in this offering may not be indicative of the market price that will prevail after this offeringSince our stock has not yet traded publicly, our management and the underwriters will negotiate the common stock's initial public offering price per share. The price they determine may not be indicative of the market price that will prevail after this offering. For example, the market price of our common stock after this offering could vary from the initial public offering price in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond our control: . changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts . future announcements concerning us or our competitors of key personnel changes, significant contracts, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, technological innovations or capital commitments . additions or departures of key personnel . quarterly fluctuations in operating results . fluctuations in the stock price and volume of traded shares, especially in the traditionally volatile Internet-related and technology sectors 13</td>

      <td>risk factors an investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. prior to investing in our ordinary shares, we encourage each prospective investor to carefully read this entire prospectus, including, without limitation, the following risk factors and the section of this prospectus entitled cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements. any of the following factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. if any of these risks occur, the value of our ordinary shares could decline, and you could lose all or part of your original investment. risks related to our business the accessories, footwear and apparel industries are heavily influenced by general macroeconomic cycles that affect consumer spending, and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits. purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. the success of our operations depends on a number of factors impacting discretionary consumer spending, including general economic conditions, consumer confidence, wages and unemployment, housing prices, consumer debt, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, taxation and political conditions. a continuation or worsening of the current weakness in the economy may negatively affect consumer and wholesale purchases of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we may not be able to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and operating results. the accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. we believe that our success is largely dependent on our brand image and ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design, styling, production, merchandising and pricing of products. if we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately, consumers may not purchase our products and our brand name and brand image may be impaired. even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brand image to be outdated or associate our brand with styles that are no longer popular or trend-setting. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and operating results.the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within north america and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline. we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign accessories, footwear and apparel producers and retailers, including, among others, coach, burberry, ralph lauren, herms, louis vuitton, gucci, marc jacobs, chlo and prada. competition is based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, the following: anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner; establishing and maintaining favorable brand-name recognition; determining and maintaining product quality; maintaining key employees; 11 maintaining and growing market share; developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers; establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with retail customers; pricing products appropriately; providing appropriate service and support to retailers; optimizing retail and supply chain capabilities; determining size and location of retail and department store selling space; and protecting intellectual property. in addition, some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories, footwear and apparel industries, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products. the general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. competition, along with such other factors as consolidation and changes in consumer spending patterns, could also result in significant pricing pressure. these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers, which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.the departure of our founder, members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. we depend on the services and management experience of our founder and executive officers, who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. in particular, mr.kors, our honorary chairman and chief creative officer, has provided design and executive leadership to the company since its inception. he is instrumental to our marketing and publicity strategy and is closely identified with both the brand that bears his name and our company in general. our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr.kors name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. mr.kors has the right to terminate his employment with us without cause. in addition, the leadership of john d. idol, our chairman and chief executive officer, and joseph b. parsons, our executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief operating officer, has been a critical element of our success. we also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing, design and advertising operations. competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense, and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our executive officers and key employees. although we have entered into employment agreements with mr.kors and certain of our other executive officers, including mr.idol and mr.parsons, we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future. the loss of services of one or more of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to, or relating to, the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to open and operate new retail stores and increase the number of department stores and specialty stores that sell our products. as part of our growth strategy, we intend to open and operate new retail stores and shop-in-shops within select department stores, both domestically and internationally. our ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to: identify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops will be considered successful; negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances, to secure suitable store locations; hire, train and retain personnel and field management; assimilate new personnel and field management into our corporate culture; source sufficient inventory levels; and successfully integrate new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops into our existing operations and information technology systems. we will encounter pre-operating costs and we may encounter initial losses when new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops commence operations. while we expect to open a number of additional retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops in fiscal 2012, there can be no assurance that we will open the planned number, that we will recover the expenditure costs associated with opening these new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops or that the operation of these new venues will be successful or profitable. any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. we face additional risks with respect to our strategy to expand internationally, including our efforts to further expand our operations in european countries and in japan as well as other asian countries. in some of these countries we do not yet have significant operating experience, and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations. many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including, but not limited to, employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate (including lease terms) and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and, as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. in addition, in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we have grown rapidly in recent years and we have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations; if we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our brand image and financial performance may suffer. we have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating experience at our current size. our total revenue increased from $397.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $803.3 million in fiscal 2011. if our operations continue to grow, we will be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarter personnel. our continued growth could strain our existing resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, difficulties in hiring, training and managing an 13 increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products and delays in production and shipments. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.as we expand our store base, we may be unable to maintain the same comparable store sales or average sales per square foot that we have in the past, which could cause our share price to decline. as we expand our store base, we may not be able to maintain the levels of comparable store sales that we have experienced historically. in addition, we may not be able to maintain our historic average sales per square foot as we move into new markets. if our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations, the price of our ordinary shares could decline. in addition, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. a variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot, including, among others, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. if we misjudge the market for our products, we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. these factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods and our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our ordinary shares.we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space under long-term, non-cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases; any failure to make these lease payments when due could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. we do not own any of our store facilities; instead, we lease all of our stores under operating leases. our leases generally have terms of 10 years with no renewal options. our leases generally require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs. for example, as of october 1, 2011, we were party to operating leases associated with our stores as well as other corporate facilities requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating $248.1million through fiscal 2016 and approximately $234.1 million thereafter through fiscal 2028. we expect that we will also lease any new stores we open under operating leases with terms similar to those contained in leases we have entered previously, which will further increase our operating lease expenses. our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including, among others: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; requiring a substantial portion of our available cash to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes; limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and placing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors. we depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us, we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs. our current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control. we have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell, under our trademarks, products requiring specialized expertise. we have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas, including, among others, korea, the philippines, singapore, malaysia, the middle east and turkey. our operations in china, hong kong, macau and taiwan are conducted pursuant to similar licensing agreements that we have entered into with entities that are indirectly owned by certain of our current shareholders, including mr.kors, mr.idol and sportswear holdings limited. see certain relationships and related party transactionsmichael kors far east holdings limited. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners, such arrangements may not be successful. our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the timing of new store openings, the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. in addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partners ability to: obtain capital; exercise operational and financial control over its business; manage its labor relations; maintain relationships with suppliers; manage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and maintain customer relationships. any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands. although we attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over store location and design, product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our stores and products, we may not be able to control the use by our licensing partners of each of our licensed brands. the misuse of our brands by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers, and the loss of any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenue. a small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales. net sales to our five largest wholesale customers were 30.4% of our total revenue for fiscal 2011 and 35.7% of our total revenue for fiscal 2010. our largest wholesale customer, a large, nationally recognized u.s. department store, accounted for 13.8% of our total revenue for fiscal 2011 and 14.5% of our total revenue for fiscal 2010. we do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale customers, and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. a decision by any of our major wholesale customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. during the past several years, the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes, and we expect such changes will continue. in addition, store closings by our wholesale customers decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a 15 smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. in the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores target markets. any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. these changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.a material disruption in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely extensively on our information technology (it) systems to track inventory, manage our supply chain, record and process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. the failure of our it systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or difficulty in integrating new systems could adversely affect our business. in addition, our it systems may be subject to damage and/or interruption from power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and usage errors by our employees. if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim. any significant disruption in our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.direct privacy breaches and the engagement of third parties to operate our e-commerce business could negatively affect our reputation, credibility and business. we are responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce website, michaelkors.com, and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. consumers are increasingly concerned over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. in addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our customers identity and privacy. we do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future. any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers. finally, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information, to the extent they are applicable.increases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer. the costs of raw materials used in our products are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. we are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials, and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials. the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain, but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. if one or more of our distribution facilities becomes inoperable, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. we operate a limited number of distribution facilities. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities. if any of these distribution 16 facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our customers and retail stores. in addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged facility. in addition, we currently operate our california distribution from three separate warehouses totaling approximately 350,000 square feet. the leases for these three facilities expire on march31, 2012. we have executed a lease for an approximately 500,000 square foot distribution center in whittier, california, which we believe will allow us to significantly increase our distribution capabilities and efficiency. we took possession of the new distribution center in october 2011 and intend to complete our transition into this facility prior to the march31, 2012 expiration of the leases for our existing california distribution facilities. as part of this transition, we will implement a new warehouse management system that will supplement our current legacy system and further support our efforts to operate with increased efficiency and flexibility. there are risks inherent in transitioning our existing three distribution facilities into one new facility and in implementing a new warehouse management system, including the risk of late delivery of possession of the new facility, difficulty in negotiating acceptable terms to remain temporarily in the existing facilities in the event of any such late delivery and other operational difficulties that may arise in commencing operations in a new facility with a new management system. any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations. our products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors located mainly in countries in asia, europe and central and south america. a manufacturing contractors failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. the failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any of the following factors could negatively affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results: political or labor instability, labor shortages or increases in costs of labor or production in countries where manufacturing contractors and suppliers are located; political or military conflict involving the united states, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials and increase transportation costs; heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods of time or could result in increased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands; a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials; disease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas; the migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced; imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust in a timely manner to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed; increases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; 17 significant fluctuation of the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies; and restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located. we do not have written agreements with any of our third-party manufacturing contractors. as a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. in fiscal 2011, our largest manufacturing contractor, who primarily produces its products in china and who we have worked with for the last seven years, accounted for the production of 30.5% of our finished products. our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, we use third-party agents to source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf. we do not have written agreements with any of our agents. as a result, any single agent could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. in fiscal 2011, our largest third-party agent, whose primary place of business is hong kong and who we have worked with for the last seven years, sourced approximately 19.5% of our purchases of finished goods. our inability to promptly replace agents that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality service in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.if our manufacturing contractors fail to use acceptable, ethical business practices, our business and reputation could suffer. we require our manufacturing contractors to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those three areas in order to promote ethical business practices, and our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our manufacturing contractors to determine compliance. however, we do not control our manufacturing contractors or their labor and other business practices. if one of our manufacturing contractors violates applicable labor or other laws, rules or regulations or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. we have a $100.0 million
