    <th>RISK FACTORS The Common Stock offered hereby involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information in this Prospectus, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in the shares of Common Stock offered by this Prospectus. This Prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Prospectus. Limited Operating History and History of Operating Losses. The Company has only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects. The Company commenced operations in November 1991 and introduced its first automatic service and support product, Win Win, in 1993 The Company introduced the first Windows 95 compatible version of its First Aid product line in September 1995. During 1996, both the Company's net revenues and operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing expenditures, increased rapidly compared to prior periods. From inception to June 30, 1996, the Company generated net revenues of $19.1 million, of which $13.9 million, or 73%, was generated in the six months ended June 30, 1996. The Company has incurred net losses in each of the last five fiscal years and for the six months ended June 30, 1996, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $7.8 million at June 30, 1996The Company's disproportionate increase in operating losses from 1992 through June 30, 1996 were primarily due to its policy of deferring revenue with no corresponding cost deferral. Approximately $3.0 million in net revenues were deferred as of June 30, 1996. In addition, since 1992, the Company's operating expenses have increased significantly as a result of efforts to expand its sales and marketing operations, including international sales, to fund greater levels of product development and to increase its administrative infrastructureManagement believes that it is not more likely than not that the Company will generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits of existing deferred assets as of June 30, 1996. See Note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of income taxes. There can be no assurance that the Company's net revenues will continue to remain at or increase from the level experienced in the first six months of 1996 or that net revenues will not decline. The Company anticipates that in the future it will make significant investments in its operations, particularly to support sales activities, and that as a result, operating expenses will increase significantly. The Company intends to make such investments on an ongoing basis, primarily from cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, funds available from the Company's line of credit and this offering, as the Company develops and introduces new products and expands into new markets such as international, corporate and OEM markets. If net revenues do not correspondingly increase, the Company is likely to continue to incur net losses and its financial condition will be materially adversely affected. The Company has not yet achieved profitability, and there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly basis or annual basis. Furthermore, operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties. The Company's prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies with limited operating histories, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. In addition, the Company's future operating results will depend upon, among other factors, the demand for the Company's software products, the level of product and price competition, the Company's success in expanding its direct and indirect distribution channels, the Company's success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified personnel, the ability of the Company to expand its international sales, develop and market new products and product upgrades and manage product transitions, the ability of the Company to control costs, the growth of activity on the Internet and the World Wide Web (the "Web"), and general economic conditions. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's control. If the Company is not successful in addressing such risks, the Company will be materially adversely affected. See "-- Potential Fluctuations in Quarterly Results; Seasonality," "-- Product Concentration; Risks Associated with First Aid Upgrades," "-- Developing Market" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Potential Fluctuations in Quarterly Results; Seasonality. The Company's quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations 5 6 may arise as a result of a number of factors, including the number and timing of new product introductions, upgrades and product enhancements by the Company or its competitors, purchasing patterns of distributors and customers, marketing and promotional programs, pricing and other competitive pressures, order deferrals and product returns in anticipation of new products or upgrades to existing products, the mix of distribution channels through which the Company's products are sold, the Company's decisions regarding hiring and other expenses, market acceptance of the Company's products, market acceptance of commerce over the Internet, technological limitations of the Internet, the developing nature of the market for the Company's products, general economic conditions and other factors. The Company generally ships products as orders are received and, accordingly, the Company has historically operated with relatively little backlog. As a result, quarterly revenues will depend predominantly on the volume and timing of orders received during a particular quarter, both of which are difficult to forecast. With the introduction of First Aid 95, the Company significantly increased its level of operating expenses. The Company anticipates that its operating expenses will continue to increase substantially in the future as a result of efforts to expand its sales and marketing operations, including expanding its international sales, to fund greater levels of product development, and to increase its administrative infrastructure. To the extent that such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased net revenues, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. A relatively high percentage of the Company's expenses is fixed in the short term and the Company is generally unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for shortfalls in net revenues. In addition, the consumer software industry in which the Company operates has seasonal elements. In recent years, the consumer software industry has experienced relatively higher demand for software products in the fourth quarter due to year-end holiday buying and relatively lower demand in the summer months. If net revenues fall below the Company's expectations, expenditure levels as a percentage of total net revenues could be disproportionately high, and operating results would be immediately and adversely affected. The Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance. Due to the foregoing factors, among others, it is likely that the Company's future quarterly operating results from time to time will not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which may have an adverse effect on the price of the Company's Common Stock. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Product Concentration; Risks Associated with First Aid Upgrades. During 1995 and the first half of 1996, over 90% of the Company's net revenues were attributable to sales of its First Aid products. The Company anticipates that sales of its First Aid products will account for substantially all of the Company's net revenues during 1996, and a substantial majority of its net revenues in 1997. There can be no assurance that net revenues from the First Aid products will continue to grow at historical rates or be sustainable at current levels. The Company's future financial performance will depend in large part on the successful development, introduction and customer acceptance of new product offerings and enhanced versions of the First Aid products. The Company is currently upgrading its First Aid products to incorporate new features to respond to evolving technical support and competitive developments. These upgrades are scheduled to be released in the fourth quarter of 1996 under the First Aid 97 title. Distributors may delay or cancel orders and return or reduce current inventory levels of First Aid 95 products in anticipation of the release of these upgrades. Furthermore, any failure or delays in releasing First Aid 97 upgrades as announced could increase the risk of such actions by distributorsThe rate of growth of sales into the channel of First Aid 95 have declined somewhat since the public announcement of the expected release of First Aid 97 which the Company believes is due to such announcement. In order to enhance continued sales of First Aid 95, the Company has introduced a rebate program for buyers of First Aid 95 and First Aid 95 Deluxe and has extended credit terms to certain customers. The First Aid 97 upgrades will not be available until mid to late fourth quarter 1996. Delays in shipping such upgradees could have material adverse effect on the Company's future business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company recently introduced a new product, Oil Change, in October 1996. To date, Oil Change has not generated any net revenues and 6 7 the Company does not expect it to generate significant net revenues for at least the near future. There can be no assurance that Oil Change will generate significant net revenues at any time in the future. Any decline in the demand for First Aid products, failure to achieve market acceptance of upgrades to such products or failure of net revenues derived from such products to meet the Company's expectations, whether as a result of competition, technological change or other factors, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Business -- Products," and "-- Technology." Management of Growth; Dependence on Key Personnel. The Company's business has grown rapidly during the past year and such growth has placed and, if sustained, will continue to place, significant demands on the Company's management and resources. Recently, the Company has significantly increased the scale of its operations to support increased sales volumes and to address critical infrastructure and other requirements. This increase included substantial investments in sales and marketing to support sales activities and the hiring of a number of new employees, which have resulted in higher operating expenses. Between December 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996, the number of Company employees increased from approximately 20 to approximately 104 and the Company currently expects to hire many additional employees during 1996. The Company's ability to manage any future growth, should it occur, will continue to depend upon the successful expansion of its sales, marketing, research and development, customer support and administrative infrastructure and the ongoing implementation and improvement of a variety of internal management systems, procedures and controls. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract, manage and retain additional personnel to support any future growth or will not experience significant problems with respect to any infrastructure expansion or the attempted implementation of systems, procedures and controlsAny failure in one or more of these areas would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The Company's future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain its key technical employees or that it will be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical personnel in the future. Any inability to attract and retain the necessary technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is dependent upon certain of its executive officers and has entered into employment agreements with certain of its executive officers in order to help assure their retention by the Company. However, there can be no assurance that any such employment agreements will sufficiently incentivize such executive officers to remain with the Company. The Company does not maintain any key person insurance policies on the lives of any of its executive officers. The loss of or inability to retain these key executive officers for any reason could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management." Competition. The PC software industry is intensely competitive and characterized by short product life cycles and frequent new product introductions. The Company competes with software companies of varying sizes and resources, including SystemSoft Corporation, Quarterdeck Corporation, Symantec Corp. and others. The Company believes that a number of software companies will be introducing automatic service and support software products in the near future that will compete with the Company's products. The Company expects that potential future competitors may include other software vendors, including Internet software vendors. Many of the Company's existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Company. Moreover, there are no proprietary barriers to entry that could keep existing and potential competitors from developing similar products or selling competing products in the Company's markets. To the extent that the Company's competitors bundle their software products with leading hardware, application software or operating system vendors, or if one or more of the operating system vendors, 7 8 such as Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), developed its own technical support software and incorporated such functionality into its products, the Company's business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully with existing or potential competitors. Increased competition may result in the loss of shelf space or a reduction in demand or sell-through of the Company's products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Microsoft's position as a large, well-capitalized software company with a dominant share of the market for PC operating system software could enable it to develop products that compete effectively with those of the Company. In particular, Microsoft is incorporating "Plug and Play" capabilities into future versions of its operating systems. Plug and Play capabilities are designed to allow PC users to add on any computer peripheral (such as a modem, video or sound card) to a Windows-based system and enable that peripheral to work immediately, without concern for software configuration errors or driver conflicts. In addition, to the extent that Microsoft incorporates functionality comparable, or perceived as comparable, to that offered by the Company into its Windows products (or separately offers comparable products), sales of the Company's products could be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurance that any such action by Microsoft or others would not render the Company's products noncompetitive or obsolete. The Company's products also compete indirectly against alternative sources of technical support, such as the technical support departments of hardware and software vendors. Additionally, the Internet provides hardware and software vendors with a new medium to offer technical support services. The Company expects that many vendors will provide Internet-based technical support services to support their existing and future products. The availability of these technical support services could materially dilute the value of the Company's products and have a material adverse effect on the Company's market position, business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Industry Background." In addition, the Company may face increasing pricing pressures from current and future competitors and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not require the Company to reduce its prices. Any material reduction in the price of the Company's products would negatively affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, and would require the Company to increase unit sales in order to maintain historic levels of net revenues. There can be no assurance that competitors will not develop products that are superior to the Company's products or that achieve greater market acceptance and thereby negatively affect sales of the Company's products. See "Business -- Distribution and Marketing" and "-- Competition." Dependence on Microsoft Windows. The Company's success is dependent on the continued widespread use of the Windows operating systems for PCs. The Company's First Aid products automatically detect, diagnose and resolve common software conflicts and configuration errors arising in the Windows operating environmentAlthough Windows operating systems are currently used by many PC users, other companies, including International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer, Inc., have developed or are developing other operating systems that compete, or will compete, with Windows. In the event that any of these alternative operating systems become widely accepted in the PC marketplace, demand for the Company's products could be adversely affected, thereby materially adversely affecting the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Microsoft may introduce a new operating system to replace Windows or could incorporate some or many of the key features of the Company's First Aid products in new versions of its operating systems, thereby eliminating the need for users to purchase the Company's products. The inability to adapt current products or to develop new products for use with any new operating systems on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company's ability to develop products based on Windows operating systems and release these products immediately prior to, or at the time of Microsoft's release of new and upgraded 8 9 Windows products is substantially dependent on its ability to gain pre-release access to, and to develop expertise in, current and future versions of WindowsThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to provide products that are compatible with future Windows releases on a timely basis, with or without the cooperation of Microsoft. Developing Market. The Company's products address the new and rapidly evolving market for automatic service and support software. The market for automatic service and support software products has only recently begun to develop and is characterized by an increasing number of existing and potential market entrants who are in the process of introducing or developing automatic service and support software. As is typical in the case of a new and rapidly evolving market, the demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. It is difficult to predict the future growth rate and size of this market. There can be no assurance that the market for the Company's products will develop, that demand for the Company's products or for automatic service and support software products in general will increase or that the rate of growth of this demand will be sustainable or will not decrease. The Company's ability to develop and successfully market additional products depends substantially on the acceptance of automatic service and support software by individual and corporate users as an effective means of addressing their technical support requirements. If the market fails to develop, develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors, or if the Company's products do not achieve or sustain market acceptance, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Business -- Industry Background" and "Business -- Products." New Product Development and Technological Change. Substantially all of the Company's net revenues have been derived, and substantially all of the Company's future net revenues are expected to be derived, from the sale of its automatic service and support software products. The market for automatic service and support software products is characterized by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The Company's products must be continually updated to address the new and evolving technical support requirements of third-party hardware and software. Failure to anticipate technical difficulties that arise from use of these third-party products and incorporate solutions to such difficulties into the Company's products would have a material adverse effect on continued market acceptance of the Company's products. The Company's ability to design, develop, test and support on a timely basis new software products, updates and enhancements that respond to technological developments and emerging industry standards is critical to the Company's future success. The Company is currently upgrading its First Aid products and expects these upgrades to be released in the fourth quarter of 1996. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in such efforts or that the Company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products and enhancements, or that its new products, upgrades and enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. The introduction of new products, upgrades or enhanced versions of existing products is subject to the risk of development delays due to resource constraints, technological change and other reasons. If the Company is unable to develop on a timely basis new software products, upgrades or enhancements to existing products or if such new products, upgrades or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Business -- Products," " -- Technology" and " -- Product Development." The Company currently employs software engineers in India on a work-for-hire basis. These engineers are primarily responsible for updating the Company's knowledge bases for current applications and upgrades. Certain of these engineers are responsible for adapting the Company's First Aid products to Windows NT. Any loss of the services of these engineers due to political or economic instability or for any other reason could adversely affect the Company's product development efforts 9 10 and thereby could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Product Development." Dependence on Distribution Channels. The Company currently sells its First Aid products primarily through distributors for resale to the retail channel and through direct mail. Sales to such distributors and sales through direct mail accounted for approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, of the Company's net revenues in the first six months of 1996. Sales from direct mail have historically operated at lower profitability levels than sales from distributors. Accordingly, quarterly shifts in the mix of sales through distributors and through direct mail could cause fluctuations in the Company's profitability. There can be no assurance that the mix or relative profitability of such sales will remain at current levels in the future. The Company is evaluating the use of alternative distribution channels for its products and began distributing Oil Change through the Internet in October 1996. Sales to a limited number of distributors have constituted and are expected to continue to constitute a substantial portion of the Company's net revenuesSales to the Company's top three distributors, Navarre Corporation ("Navarre"), Ingram Micro, Inc. ("Ingram Micro") and Micro Central, Inc. ("Micro Central"), accounted for approximately 22%, 20% and 11%, respectively, of the Company's net revenues in the six months ended June 30, 1996. The loss of, or reduction in, orders from any of these distributors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial conditionHistorically, margins for distributors in the PC software industry have been low, competition has been intense and distributors have relied on timely payments from their customers. In September 1996, NeoStar Retail Group, Inc. ("NeoStar"), a major PC software retailer and a reseller of the Company's products, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In the event that NeoStar is unable to come to a satisfactory resolution with its creditors, it may cause financial difficulties for one or more PC software distributors, including those of the Company. Financial difficulties of any distributors could render the Company's associated accounts receivable uncollectible, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any special distribution arrangements or product pricing arrangements that the Company may implement for strategic purposes in one or more of its distribution channels could materially adversely affect its margins. The distribution channels through which consumer software products are sold have been characterized by rapid change, including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain distributors and retailers and the emergence of new retailers such as general mass merchandisers. In addition, due to an increase in the number of software applications, there are an increasing number of companies competing for access to these channels. Retailers of the Company's products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition for high quality and adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support from the retailers. The Company believes this competition for shelf space will increase in the near term as competitors introduce new automatic service and support software. There can be no assurance that retailers will continue to purchase the Company's products or provide the Company's products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support, the lack of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Distribution and Marketing." Risk of Product Returns. The Company's business includes a substantial risk of product returns from distributors, retailers and end users, either through the exercise of contractual return rights or as a result of the Company's policy of assisting customers in balancing and updating inventories. Individual end users may return products within 60 days of the date of purchase for a full refund. Most retailers, distributors and end users also have the ability to return products for a full refund. In addition, competitors' promotional or other activities could cause returns to increase sharply at any time. Further, the rate of product returns could increase if general mass merchandisers become a larger percentage of the Company's business or other changes in the Company's distribution channel occur. Large shipments in anticipation of unrealized demand can lead to overstocking by the Company's distributors or retailers and result in substantial product returns. In addition, the inventory transition resulting from the introduction of product upgrades, including the currently planned 10 11 introduction of First Aid 97, could result in an increased level of returns for prior versions. Furthermore, the risk of product returns will increase if demand for the Company's products declines. Although the Company establishes reserves based on estimated future returns of products, taking into account promotional activities, the timing of new product introductions, distributor and retailer inventories of the Company's products and other factors, there can be no assurance that actual levels of returns will not significantly exceed amounts anticipated by the Company. In addition, the Company provides price protection to its distributors in the event the Company reduces its prices. While to date, the number of products returned to the Company has been immaterial, there can be no assurance that the number of returns will not significantly increase in the future. Any material increase in the level of returns could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Business -- Distribution and Marketing." Dependence on the Internet. The commercial viability of Oil Change and the Company's ability to execute its strategy to leverage Oil Change as an Internet-based platform for other products and services are dependent upon the continued development and acceptance of the Internet as a delivery medium for third-party software programs. In addition, the Company's future success may be dependent upon continued growth in the use of the Internet in order to support the distribution of products and future upgrades. The use of the Internet as a distribution channel is new and unproven and represents a significant departure from traditional distribution methods employed by software companies. Critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet (including security, reliability, cost, ease of use and access and speed) remain unresolved and may affect the use of the Internet as a medium to distribute software. There can be no assurance that the use of the Internet as a distribution channel will be effective for either current or future products. The failure of the Internet to be an effective distribution channel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and prospects. The Company's future success depends, in part, upon the future growth of the Internet for commercial transactions. There can be no assurance that communication or commerce over the Internet will become widespread and it is not known whether this market will develop to the extent necessary for demand for the Company's products to emerge and become sustainable. The Internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons, including inadequate communications bandwidth and a lack of secure payment mechanisms. To the extent that the Internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and level of use, there can be no assurance that the Internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed upon it. Moreover, the Internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or ado</th>

all or part of your investment. risks related to our businessour business has experienced significant losses and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. through the end of december 2004, we have spent approximately $1.2 billion in connection with the development and launch of our business. to date, the build-out of our infrastructure and our day-to-day operations have been financed substantially by our financing activities, and we have had limited revenue from operations. as of december 31, 2004, we had incurred aggregate losses of approximately $2.1 billion. we plan to dedicate significant resources to our current business strategy, including increased marketing and construction of terrestrial repeater networks in india, development of next generation mobile receivers and launch of service in china and western europe. in addition, to the extent we have positive annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda), we are required to make payments of 10% of our ebitda under our royalty agreement with stonehouse capital limited (stonehouse). we anticipate that, in the near term, we will continue to rely on the proceeds from our private placement of senior convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $155 million in december 2004, the proceeds from our private placement of shares of class a common stock to xm for an aggregate purchase price of $25 million in july 2005 and the proceeds from this offering to sustain our operations. in the future, we will need to generate significant revenue in order to achieve a profit from operations, and we can offer you no assurance that we will ever become profitable.there may not be sufficient demand for our service to allow us to become profitable. we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the potential market demand in our target markets for a subscription-based digital satellite radio service or the degree to which our service will meet such market demand. we will achieve or fail to gain market acceptance depending upon many factors, some of which are not within our control, including: whether we can offer sufficient high-quality programming consistent with our potential customers preferences; the willingness of consumers, on a mass-market basis, to pay subscription fees to obtain satellite radio broadcasts; the extent to which we can limit customer turnover, either as a result of customers electing voluntarily to discontinue our service (including customers who discontinue following rate increases at the end of any promotion) or as a result of customers being discontinued due to nonpayment; the cost, availability and consumer acceptance of receivers capable of receiving our broadcasts; our marketing and pricing strategies, as well as those of our receiver manufacturers; competition from other media and entertainment in our target markets; the development of alternative technologies or services; and the general economic, political and social conditions in our target markets. risk factors if for any reason we cannot achieve a rapid and significant level of consumer acceptance for our service, we may not achieve the market penetration rates necessary for us to execute our business plan successfully. high subscriber acquisition costs could adversely affect our profitability. in order to attract subscribers to our service in india, we are subsidizing a portion of the costs of purchasing the lowest-cost receiver capable of receiving our broadcast that is offered in our indian market. we intend to continue to subsidize a portion of the costs of purchasing receivers in our indian market and in other markets as we introduce our service. we are also in the process of launching a large advertising and sales campaign and other promotional activities as we roll out our services in different markets in india. consequently, our subscriber acquisition costs are expected to increase substantially. our subscriber acquisition costs may increase even further if we determine that more aggressive advertising, promotions or other marketing efforts are necessary to promote faster subscriber growth or to respond to competition, or are otherwise advisable. if these subscriber acquisition costs become sufficiently high they could materially adversely affect our financial performance.we may not be able to compete effectively against conventional radio stations or other potential providers of consumer audio services. in seeking market acceptance, we will encounter competition for both listeners and future advertising revenue from many sources, including traditional and, when available, digital am/fm radio, shortwave radio, internet based audio providers, direct broadcast satellite television audio service, systems that carry audio service and digital music players. we could also face competition from terrestrial digital radio services in the future, although such services are not currently offered in india or china, our two immediate target markets. unlike our service, traditional am/fm radio already has a well-established market presence for its services and generally offers free-to-air broadcast reception supported by commercial advertising, rather than by a subscription fee. also, many radio stations offer information programming of a local nature, such as news and sports reports, which we may not be able to offer as effectively as local radio stations. to the extent that consumers place a high value on these features of traditional am/fm radio, we are at a competitive disadvantage to the traditional providers of audio entertainment services. in addition, although potential competition in our target markets with other satellite broadcast radio services is limited by regulatory and other restrictions, such competition could emerge. if an alternative satellite radio broadcast system that is comparable or superior to our system were to be introduced in our target markets, or if any competitor were to begin offering another mobile dars before we do, we could experience competitive pressure or be at a competitive disadvantage.our independent auditors have identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal controls, and if we are unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate controls we will not be able to comply with applicable regulatory requirements imposed on reporting companies. we have experienced severe working capital constraints for several years and, as a result, we have operated with very limited staffing of key functions, including accounting. we have also experienced turnover of our accounting staff, including the replacement of our chief financial officer and the loss of our controller in september 2004. these circumstances have increased demands on our internal accounting and financial staff. our independent auditors have identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal controls in their 2004 internal control letter to us. we have engaged pricewaterhousecoopers as a third-party consultant with respect to the development of appropriate internal controls. we have also recruited and hired two key senior accounting and finance employees at the senior vice president level, risk factors one to serve as our corporate controller, the other to help enhance internal controls and other systems to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. we are also actively hiring additional staff to augment our accounting and finance functions. we are in the process of establishing such new and enhanced systems of internal controls as we believe necessary to allow management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest to, our internal controls, as required by the management certification and auditor attestation requirements mandated by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. we will be performing system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) of our internal control system on an ongoing basis. while we anticipate being able to implement fully the requirements relating to internal controls and all other applicable requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 in a timely fashion, we cannot be certain as to the timing of the completion of our evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation or the impact of the same on our operations. our development, implementation and maintenance of appropriate internal controls will depend materially both on our successful hiring and retention of key senior accounting personnel. in addition to addressing the accounting and internal controls of our current operations, our employees and systems will have to accommodate increasingly complex financial reporting demands as we expand our operations in india and as we introduce our services in other markets, including china. we will also have to be able to retain and attract appropriately qualified personnel in key staff areas to maintain an effective accounting and internal controls system. if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, to implement and integrate financial reporting and accounting systems or if we are unable to scale these systems to our growth, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations or comply with the requirements of the sec, the nasdaq national market or the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, which could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the suspension or delisting of our class a common stock from the nasdaq national market and the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our class a common stock, or investigation by regulatory authorities. any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. our satellites have a limited life and may fail in orbit. satellites utilize highly complex technology and, accordingly, are subject to in-orbit failures after they have been successfully placed into operation. our afristar satellite was launched in october 1998, and our asiastar satellite was launched in march 2000. our satellites are designed to operate in orbit for approximately 12 years after launch. after this period, our satellites performance in delivering our service may deteriorate. each satellite has an orbital maneuver life of 15 years, which means that each satellite has been designed to maintain its assigned orbital position (within 0.1 degrees) for 15 years. the useful life of our satellites may vary from our estimate. if one of our satellites were to fail or suffer significant performance degradation prematurely and unexpectedly, it would cause interruption in the continuity of our service or impair the quality of our service. a number of factors could decrease the useful lives of our in-orbit satellites, including: expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels; defects in the quality of construction; failure of satellite components or systems that are not protected by back-up units; loss of the on-board station-keeping system that maintains the geosynchronous position; unexpected increase in use of fuel; and in rare cases, damage or destruction by electrostatic storms or collisions with other objects in space. risk factors our afristar satellite has developed a defect in its solar panels. the panels are collecting less power than intended, and we expect that this will affect that satellites operation starting in 2008. at that time we will need to make an operating decision regarding the use of our afristar satellite, since it would be possible to extend the useful life of the satellite through careful management of the power generated by the solar array. this may require broadcasting a smaller number of channels over one or more of its beams in order to conserve power or reducing the power radiated by one or more of its beams with a resulting reduction of the broadcast coverage area. our target markets of india and china are served by the asiastar satellite and are not affected by the performance of our afristar satellite. our insurance may not cover all risks of operating our satellites. we currently maintain in-orbit insurance coverage for our asiastar and afristar satellites, which would reimburse us for a portion of the insured satellite value in the event of a partial loss or for the full insured value in the event of a total loss, subject to stipulated deductibles and exclusions. each satellites current policy is for one year, and we anticipate that our in-orbit insurance policies will continue to be on a year-to-year basis, which has become standard in the industry. the company believes, based on its recent negotiations with respect to obtaining in-orbit insurance for afristar, and assuming afristar does not sustain any further unexpected deterioration, that the company will continue to be able to procure in-orbit insurance for both satellites. however, even when obtained, in-orbit insurance for a satellite will not protect against all losses to a satellite. our current insurance policies contain specified exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations. moreover, although we intend to maintain insurance on our asiastar and afristar satellites, any determination we make as to whether to maintain in-orbit insurance coverage will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of insurance in the market and the cost of available insurance. we will also consider the exclusions to coverage, if any, required by insurers and the other terms and conditions upon which the insurance is available. even if we seek to obtain replacement insurance in the future, we may not be able to obtain this insurance on reasonable terms and conditions. moreover, this insurance coverage may be costly, if available at all. the cost of insurance may increase or its terms may become disadvantageous with respect to exclusions and deductibles as a result of several factors, including the failure or degradation of performance of one of our in-orbit satellites or the failure of a similar satellite owned by another operator. in addition to other material, adverse effects on us, the partial or total loss of an uninsured satellite would cause us to recognize a loss equal to the book value of any such total loss or, in the case of a partial loss, an amount equal to the proportion of the satellites book value corresponding to such partial loss.our on-ground satellites may be damaged or destroyed during launch. in addition to afristar and asiastar, we have two additional satellites, one fully assembled satellite (f3) and another satellite (f4) for which the long lead parts have been procured and partially assembled, which are currently maintained in storage in toulouse, france. we have accepted risk of loss for these satellites and maintain ground insurance for both these satellites. the f3 satellite, which can be used to replace either afristar or asiastar, may also be modified and launched to provide dars in western europe. in such case, it is envisioned that the f4 satellite, upon full assembly, would be maintained as an on-ground spare satellite that could be launched in the event that one of our other three satellites experiences an in-orbit failure. the launch of a satellite is subject to significant risks, including launch failure, satellite destruction or damage during launch or failure to achieve proper orbital placement. launch failure rates vary depending on the particular launch vehicle and contractor, which have not yet been determined with respect to the companys f3 and f4 satellites. if the launch of either our f3 or f4 satellite were to fail, result in destruction or material damage during launch or fail to achieve proper orbital placement, we would suffer, in addition to any cost relating to building or procuring a replacement satellite and launching such satellite that are not covered by insurance, a significant disruption in the development of the relevant portion of our business as well as a significant impact on our earnings as a result of the delay in revenue producing activities. risk factors because the vast majority of our revenue will be derived from operations outside the united states, while our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, changes in the exchange rates between the local currencies of our operations and the u.s. dollar could materially affect our reported results of operation. we anticipate that the vast majority of our revenue will be derived from our operations outside the united states, particularly india, china and western europe. we present our consolidated financial statements in u.s. dollars. accordingly, changes in the exchange rates between the local currencies of our operations and the u.s. dollar could materially affect the translation of financial results into u.s. dollars for purposes of reporting our financial results. because we report our financial results in u.s. dollars, our consolidated financial statements will include gains and losses from foreign currency translation adjustments, and these adjustments could have a material impact on our reported results of operations and could result in significant period-to-period fluctuations in our reported results of operations which are not attributable to, and may be at variance with, our actual business performance. exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the relative values of working capital advances between our various subsidiaries and of payments to and receipts from third parties, the effects of which impact our results of operations.royalty payments to stonehouse could materially limit our available working capital and negatively impact our results of operations. we have significant contingent annual payment obligations for the next ten years under our royalty agreement with stonehouse. we are obligated to pay to stonehouse 10% of our annual ebitda, if any, for each annual period through december31, 2015. in addition, we must maintain a segregated reserve account to be funded in each quarter of any year in which ebitda is forecast to be positive at the rate of 25% of the estimated annual payment. the royalty agreement also places certain limitations on our ability to freely dispose of assets. the royalty payment and reserve account obligation and the restrictions imposed by the royalty agreement could limit our cash flow and funds available for our working capital, and could result in a charge against our earnings which could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations. see pre-offering recapitalization and certain relationships and related party transactions.we may incur significant delays and expense in the development and installation of terrestrial repeater transmitters, and we cannot be certain that the systems will function properly. our planned introduction of a mobile service in india requires the installation of a network of terrestrial repeating transmitters (terrestrial repeaters), which serve as gap fillers to avoid signal disruption in the markets in which we plan to offer mobile products. the eventual roll-out of our mobile services in china and western europe will also require the installation of networks of terrestrial repeaters. we intend to install terrestrial repeaters to rebroadcast our satellite signals in various cities in india as we expand our terrestrial network and roll out our services. we are currently developing newtechnology for the future terrestrial repeaters in cooperation with sed systems, a division of calian ltd. we may experience significant delays in deploying the repeater network in india if the terrestrial repeater technology turns out to be more complex than we currently expect. moreover, since we rely on sed to provide key technical expertise, personnel-related delays may be outof our control. as our current receivers are not compatible with the terrestrial repeaters, we will alsoneed to offer a next generation of receivers that can receive these rebroadcasts as well as broadcasts directly from our satellites. until we have installed and tested a substantial portion of the new equipment we cannot be certain that our mobile dars will function using the terrestrial repeaters. in addition, some areas may still experience dead zones and we may incur additional costs to install terrestrial repeaters to cover these areas. we also may experience significant delays and expense in the implementation of our current plan to install risk factors terrestrial repeaters in the event that third-parties with existing terrestrial repeater networks, including radio broadcasters, upon whom we may be relying to secure optimal sites and install our terrestrial repeater network, do not cooperate with us or do not act in a timely and effective manner. we may also experience signal interference with our new receivers in india and later in china and western europe, due to terrestrial transmissions in portions of the l band spectrum. when we identify a signal that is interfering with our terrestrial rebroadcasts, we will seek to negotiate a solution with the local operator of the transmitter. however, we may not always be able to reach a timely agreement through the relevant government authorities responsible for frequency management that will allow our customers to receive our service without any interference. we may be unable to obtain the authorizations required to operate our terrestrial repeater networks in india or to retain the necessary authorizations to operate a subscription service. the indian government does not currently have a regulatory framework or written policy governing satellite radio services, and we are presently the only satellite radio services provider in the country. we have received the government authorizations that are presently required to provide our existing subscription service and to import our current receivers. however, in order to deploy complementary terrestrial repeaters in india, we will be required to obtain spectrum allocation and transmitter authorizations and may also be required to obtain service licenses. in addition, the indian government may require that we obtain additional authorizations or licenses or may impose restrictions on our business. moreover, in the recommendation paper issued on june 27, 2005 the telecom regulatory authority of india (trai) recommended to the indian government that a revenue share fee of 4% of gross earnings generated in india be imposed if the satellite broadcaster uses terrestrial repeaters. further, the indian government is planning to issue regulations governing dars, and such regulations may require us to obtain additional authorizations or licenses or impose restrictions on our business. in addition, trai has also recommended that the indian government regulate content of dars providers. any failure to obtain any required licenses or further authorizations or any material changes in our current authorizations or imposition of any additional restrictions could adversely affect our ability to carry out our business plan in india. given the lack of mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms at the international telecommunication union, there is no guarantee that the frequencies used by afristar and asiastar will be protected from interference from non-conforming uses. even though the afristar and asiastar frequency assignments have completed coordination and notification procedures under the international telecommunication union (itu) and therefore enjoy priority over other uses, there is no guarantee that the use of those frequencies will be protected from interference from non-conforming uses by other administrations. in the event that harmful interference is caused by a non-conforming frequency assignment, the itu procedures described in article 8 and article 15 of the radio regulations would apply. while these procedures set forth the good faith obligations to resolve any such interference, they do not contain mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms. rather, the radio regulations dispute resolution procedures are based on the willingness of the parties concerned to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. neither the itu specifically, nor international law generally, provides clear remedies if this voluntary process fails. since the frequency band that can be used for broadcasting-satellite service (sound) is limited to 25 mhz (1,4671,492 mhz) and our two satellites combined occupy virtually all of that spectrum, it may not be possible to eliminate interference by changing frequencies in the area(s) affected. risk factors we may experience delays and incur significant costs in the development and production of our receivers. the timely manufacture and distribution of our receivers at a price that is attractive to consumers is a critical factor in the execution of our business plan. the receivers for our indian market are manufactured by a limited number of third-party vendors. we expect the same will be true for the receivers for our chinese market. because the current market for our receivers is limited, the financial incentive for manufacturers to produce significant quantities of our receivers at an attractive price is similarly limited. if we are unable to maintain established relationships with our manufacturers or develop comparable relationships with new vendors, we could experience delays in the development, supply and availability of our receivers at acceptable quality and price levels. our business plan also depends on the reduction of the cost of our receivers in order to make them available to consumers at an attractive price. currently, to encourage sales of our receivers, we subsidize our lowest-cost receivers in india. we expect that in the near term future, we will need to continue to subsidize the cost of our receivers by offering them to distributors at a price below their cost to us. if we cannot reduce such subsidies in the future, our earnings and results of operations will be negatively affected.our next generation of receivers will eventually replace our current receivers, which may result in increased costs, higher subscriber turnover, or lower receiver sales. in connection with the introduction of our mobile dars and the introduction of our next generation of receivers, we intend to begin broadcasting our signal in a modified waveform. our current receivers will not be able to decode the modified waveform signal. while we intend to broadcast in both waveforms for a period of time, we will eventually cease broadcasting in the older waveform. we will have to transition our subscribers from the older receivers to our next generation receivers. because our next generation of receivers will, when introduced, be more expensive than our existing receivers, we will face increased costs to the extent we decide to subsidize the transition of our current subscribers to our next generation receivers. in addition, new customers may not be willing to pay for the higher priced new receivers. we may also experience higher subscriber turnover if existing subscribers decide not to purchase a new receiver.our ability to conduct our business in china may be adversely affected if we cannot maintain our relationship with chinasat or another licensed chinese telecommunications operator and obtain approval for our content from the appropriate chinese regulatory authorities. our next critical target market after india is china. due to the ownership restrictions under chinese law and our intention to broadcast chinese programming through an uplink station in beijing, we have depended on china satellite communication corporation (chinasat), in which we have no ownership, to obtain the necessary regulatory authorizations from the ministry of information industry (mii) and the chinese state administration of radio, film and television (sarft). chinasat, as our agent, has acquired the required government approvals for spectrum allocation and is seeking additional approvals necessary for operating satellite transmission services in china. we are also a party to two active agreements with chinese companies to manufacture the receivers necessary for our customers to receive our service. we will also need to partner with local institutions to obtain regulatory approval from sarft for our audio content broadcast by our service and approval from the appropriate chinese regulatory authorities for data content. our ability to execute our business plan in china will depend on our relationship with chinasat (or with another of the licensed chinese telecommunications operators that are able to obtain and hold the necessary spectrum and operations licenses), the mii and sarft. therefore, any disruption in these relationships could materially delay or impair the implementation of our china business plan and our future profits. moreover, there can be no assurance that chinasat (or such other operator) or other future local partners will obtain the necessary licenses or approvals. in addition, should chinasat or any other entity with which we partner in china fail to perform its risk factors obligations under our agreements, we may have to rely on legal remedies under chinese law. the laws and regulations relating to contractual arrangements and foreign investment in china are relatively new and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties, which could limit our ability to enforce these agreements in china. failure of our ground network infrastructure would adversely affect our ability to broadcast content up to our satellites. we rely on our ground network infrastructure, including our satellite control network and our broadcast facilities, for key operations, including transmitting broadcast signals up to our satellites. we have limited broadcast facilities to transmit content to our satellites for broadcast to our customers. we rely primarily on our singapore uplink station, which is hosted by singapore telecom, to transmit content to our indian market, as our melbourne, australia uplink station only has the transmitting capacity to transmit approximately four channels. our uplink stations were uniquely built for us and, therefore, it will take a significant amount of time to obtain replacement parts in the event they are needed. if a natural or other disaster significantly damaged our broadcast system, particularly our singapore uplink station, if key parts were to fail for any reason, or if singapore telecom failed to support the singapore uplink station properly or terminated their host services contract, our ability to provide service to subscribers, at least on an interim basis, would be limited substantially.we have faced in the past, and may face in the future, challenges and constraints in obtaining financing. there can be no assurance that we will not need to raise additional financing to carry out our current business plan. we have faced, and in the future may continue to face, many challenges and constraints in financing our development and operations. for several years we have experienced severe working capital constraints and have incurred substantial delays in implementing our business plan largely as a result of our inability to raise financing. for example, prior to 2005, financing shortfalls forced us to limit our indian marketing effort and the roll-out of our services. we cannot guarantee that in the future we will not experience periods where we have limited funding and difficulty in raising any necessary capital on favorable terms, if at all. during any such period, we would continue to need significant amounts of cash to fund our capital expenditures, administrative and overhead costs, and contractual obligations. in such circumstances, if we were not able to obtain additional financing, we could be forced to curtail, or even cease, operations</th>

    <th>risk factors an investment in our common stock offered by this prospectus involves a substantial risk of loss. you should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this prospectus, before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations. risks related to our business we are an early stage company with a history of losses. we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. we have incurred net losses since our inception. for the years ended december31, 2004, 2005, and 2006 we had net losses of approximately $2.8 million, $3.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, and for the six months ended june 30, 2007 we had a net loss of approximately $2.5 million. through june 30, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $15.5 million. to date, we have been, and expect to remain for the foreseeable future, mostly in a research and development stage. since our inception, we have not generated revenue, except for modest revenue in 2006 and 2007 relating to two research and development collaboration and license agreements. we have incurred substantial research and development expenses, which were approximately $1.5 million, $2.0million and $4.1 million for the years ended december31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, and $3.5million for the six months ended june 30, 2007. we expect to continue to make, for at least the next several years, significant expenditures for the development of products that incorporate our aganocide compounds, as well as continued research into the biological activities of our aganocide compounds, which expenditures are accounted for as research and development expenses. we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercialized within the next several years, if at all, except as may be commercialized pursuant to our agreement with an affiliate of kinetic concepts, inc., pursuant to which we granted them the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize nvc-101, as well as other products containing hypochlorous acid as the principal active ingredient, worldwide for use in wound care in humans, other than products or uses intended for the eye, ear or nose. we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable. we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we: conduct pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates in different indications; seek regulatory clearances and approvals for our product candidates; develop, formulate, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates either independently or with partners; pursue, acquire or in-license additional compounds, products or technologies, or expand the use of our technology; maintain, defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property; and hire additional qualified personnel. we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. if we cannot successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates, either independently or with partners, we will not be able to generate such revenues or achieve or maintain profitability in the future. our failure to achieve and subsequently maintain profitability could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. our limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate our business and to assess our future viability. our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, developing our technology, researching and developing our compounds, and conducting preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials of our compounds. we have not demonstrated the ability to succeed in achieving clinical endpoints, obtain regulatory approvals, formulate and manufacture products on a commercial scale or conduct sales and marketing activities. consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability are unlikely to be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.we have very limited data on the use of our products in humans and will need to perform costly and time consuming clinical trials in order to bring our products to market. most of the data that we have on our products is from in-vitro (laboratory) studies or in-vivo animal studies. we will need to conduct phase i, ii and iii human clinical trials to confirm such results in order to obtain fda approval of our compounds. often, positive in-vitro or in-vivo animal studies are not followed by positive results in human clinical trials, and we may not be able to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for indicated uses in humans. in addition, for each indication, we estimate that it will take between three and five years to conduct the necessary clinical trials and will cost between $15 million and $30 million.we currently do not have any marketable products, and if we are unable to develop and obtain regulatory approval for products that we develop, we may never generate product revenues. to date, our revenues have been derived solely from two research and development collaboration and license agreements. we have never generated revenues from sales of products and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable drugs or other products. satisfaction of all regulatory requirements applicable to our product candidates typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity, novelty and classification of the product candidates, and requires the expenditure of substantial resources for research and development and testing. before proceeding with clinical trials, we will conduct pre-clinical studies, which may, or may not be, valid predictors of potential outcomes in humans. if pre-clinical studies are favorable, we will then begin clinical trials. we must demonstrate that our product candidates satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before we can submit for and gain approval from the u.s. food and drug administration, or fda, and other regulatory authorities in the united states and in other countries. in addition, to compete effectively, our products will need to be easy to use, cost-effective and economical to manufacture on a commercial scale. we may not achieve any of these objectives. we cannot be certain that the clinical development of any of our current product candidates or any other product that we may develop in the future will be successful, that they will receive the regulatory approvals required to commercialize them, or that any of our other in-licensing efforts or pre-clinical testing will yield a product suitable for entry into clinical trials. our commercial revenues from sales of products will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for at least the next several years, if at all.we have limited experience in developing drugs and medical devices, and we may be unable to commercialize any of the products we develop. development and commercialization of drugs and medical devices involves a lengthy and complex process. we have limited experience in developing products and have never received regulatory approval for, nor commercialized, any of our product candidates. in addition, no one has ever developed or commercialized a product based on our aganocide compounds, and we cannot assure you that it is possible to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any products based on these compounds or that we will be successful in doing so. 10 before we can develop and commercialize any new products, we will need to expend significant resources to: undertake and complete clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates; maintain and expand our intellectual property rights; obtain marketing and other approvals from the fda and other regulatory agencies; and select collaborative partners with suitable manufacturing and commercial capabilities. the process of developing new products takes several years. our product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including: the failure of our product candidates to demonstrate safety and efficacy; the high cost of clinical trials and our lack of financial and other resources; and our inability to partner with firms with sufficient resources to assist us in conducting clinical trials. success in early clinical trials often is not replicated in later studies, and few research and development projects result in commercial products. at any point, we may abandon development of a product candidate or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical trials, which would eliminate or adversely impact the timing for revenues from those product candidates. if a clinical study fails to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates, we may abandon the development of the product or product feature that was the subject of the clinical trial, which could harm our business. even if we develop products for commercial use, these products may not be accepted by the medical and pharmaceutical marketplaces or be capable of being offered at prices that will enable us to become profitable. we cannot assure you that our products will be approved by regulatory authorities or ultimately prove to be useful for commercial markets, meet applicable regulatory standards, or be successfully marketed.we do not have our own manufacturing capacity, and we plan to rely on partnering arrangements or third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our potential products. we do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our product candidates. we have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. as a result, we expect to partner with third parties to manufacture our products or rely on contract manufacturers to supply, store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. any performance failure on the part of our commercial partners or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and reducing the potential for product revenues. our products, if developed and commercialized, will require precise, high quality manufacturing. the failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards, including the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. contract manufacturers and partners often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. these manufacturers and partners are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or gmp, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards; however, we do not have control over third-party compliance with these regulations and standards. if any of our manufacturers or partners fails to maintain compliance, the production of our products could be interrupted, resulting in delays, additional costs and potentially lost revenues. 11 in addition, if the fda or other regulatory agencies approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale, we will need to manufacture them in larger quantities. significant scale-up of manufacturing will require validation studies, which the fda must review and approve. if we are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of any drugs may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply and our business may be harmed as a result.if we do not maintain our current research collaboration with alcon and kci and enter into additional collaborations, a portion of our funding may decrease and inhibit our ability to develop new products. we have entered into a collaborative arrangement with alcon manufacturing ltd. (alcon), and we rely on alcon for joint intellectual property creation and for substantially all of our near-term revenues. under the agreement, we licensed to alcon the exclusive rights (except for certain retained marketing rights) to develop, manufacture and commercialize products incorporating the aganocide compounds for application in connection with the eye, ear and sinus and for use in contact lens solutions. we have also entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of kinetic concepts, inc. pursuant to which we granted to them the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize our nvc-101 compound worldwide for use in wound care in humans (other than products or uses intended for the eye, ear or nose). under the terms of the alcon agreement, we received a non-refundable technology access fee of $10.0 million and are entitled to certain semi-annual payments for research and development conducted by us under the agreement for four years after the effective date of the agreement, unless alcon elects to extend this funding term. in addition, if certain milestones are achieved in connection with the development of a product, we are entitled to receive varying milestone payments for the first achievement of each such milestone for a licensed product in each field of use. under the terms of the agreement with the kinetic concepts affiliate (kci), we received a non-refundable technology access fee of $200,000 and will be entitled to receive additional amounts of up to $1.25 million if certain milestones are met. if products developed under these agreements are commercialized, we will also be entitled to receive royalty payments. we cannot assure you that our collaboration with alcon or kci or any other collaborative arrangement will be successful, or that we will receive the full amount of research funding, milestone payments or royalties, or that any commercially valuable intellectual property will be created, from these arrangements. if alcon or kci were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct its collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner, the research contemplated by our collaboration with them could be delayed or terminated and our costs of performing studies may increase. we plan on entering into additional collaborations and licensing arrangements. we may not be able to negotiate additional collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all, and these collaborations may not be successful. our current and future success depends in part on our ability to enter into successful collaboration arrangements and maintain the collaboration arrangement we currently have. if we are unable to enter into, maintain or extend successful collaborations, our business may be harmed.we may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures or in-license compounds that could disrupt our business, harm our operating results, dilute your ownership interest in us, or cause us to incur debt or significant expense. as part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and assets, and enter into technology or pharmaceutical compound licensing arrangements. we also may pursue strategic alliances that leverage our core technology and industry experience to enhance our ability to commercialize our product candidates and expand our product offerings or distribution. we have no experience with respect to acquiring other companies and limited experience with respect to the formation of commercial partnering agreements, strategic alliances, joint ventures or in-licensing of compounds. if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. if we in-license any additional compounds, we may fail to develop the product candidates, and spend significant resources before determining whether a compound we have in-licensed will produce revenues. any future acquisitions or in-licensing by us also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could harm our operating results. integration of an acquired company also may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing 12 development of our existing business. we may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture. to finance any acquisitions, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute your interest in us. if the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies for stock. alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions by incurring indebtedness. additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.we may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future which may in turn limit our ability to develop and commercialize products and technologies. we expect our capital outlays and operating expenditures to substantially increase over at least the next several years as we expand our product pipeline and increase research and development efforts and clinical and regulatory activities. conducting clinical trials is very expensive, and we expect that we will need to raise additional capital, through future private or public equity offerings, strategic alliances or debt financing, before we achieve commercialization of any of our aganocide compounds. in addition, we may require even more significant capital outlays and operating expenditures if we do not partner with a third party to develop and commercialize our products. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the scope, rate of progress and cost of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development activities; future clinical trial results; the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; the cost and timing of regulatory approvals; the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop; the effect of competing technological and market developments; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions. we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding. additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. even if we succeed in selling additional securities to raise funds, our existing shareholders ownership percentage would be diluted and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. if we raise additional capital through strategic alliance and licensing arrangements, we may have to trade our rights to our technology, intellectual property or products to others on terms that may not be favorable to us. if we raise additional capital through debt financing, the financing may involve covenants that restrict our business activities. in addition, it is often the case that the cost of pharmaceutical development can be significantly greater than initially anticipated. this may be due to any of a large number of possible reasons, some of which could have been anticipated, while others may be caused by unpredictable circumstances. a significant increase in our costs would cause the amount of financing that would be required to enable us to achieve our goals to be likewise increased. 13 if we determine that we need to raise additional funds and we are not successful in doing so, we may be unable to complete the clinical development of some or all of our product candidates or to seek or obtain fda approval of our product candidates. such events could force us to discontinue product development, enter into a relationship with a strategic partner earlier than currently intended, reduce sales and marketing efforts or forego attractive business opportunities.we depend on skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business effectively. if we are unable to recruit, hire and retain these employees, our ability to manage and expand our business will be harmed, which would impair our future revenue and profitability. our success largely depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our officers, especially our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, vice-president of research and development and vice president of medical affairs, and other key employees. the efforts of each of these persons is critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies and as we attempt to transition into a company with commercial products. any of our officers and other key employees may terminate their employment at any time. the loss of any of our senior management team members could weaken our management expertise and harm our ability to compete effectively, develop our technologies and implement our business strategies. our ability to retain our skilled labor force and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future. our research and development programs and collaborations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and technicians. we may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, particularly in the san francisco bay area. we also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel. we have also encountered difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel from outside the san francisco bay area, due to the high housing costs in the area.if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan. our future growth, if any, may cause a significant strain on our management, and our operational, financial and other resources. our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems and to expand, train, manage and motivate our employees. these demands may require the hiring of additional management personnel and the development of additional expertise by management. any increase in resources devoted to research and product development without a corresponding increase in our operational, financial and management information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.it may be difficult to recruit and retain independent members for our board of directors. the burdens being placed on the members of a board of directors by applicable laws and regulations are making it increasingly difficult to recruit qualified candidates to be members of a board of directors of a public company. these same burdens may make it increasingly difficult to retain members of our board of directors. if we are unable to maintain a board of directors in which our shareholders have confidence, this could have an adverse impact on shareholder confidence and on the price of our stock.if our facilities become inoperable, we will be unable to perform our research and development activities, fulfill the requirements under our collaboration agreement and continue developing products and, as a result, our business will be harmed. we do not have redundant laboratory facilities. we perform substantially all of our research, development and testing in our laboratory located in emeryville, california. emeryville is situated on or near active earthquake fault lines. our facility and the equipment we use to perform our research, development and testing 14 would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. the facility may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development and testing for some period of time. the inability to perform our research and development activities may result in the loss of partners or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those partnerships in the future. our insurance coverage for damage to our property and the disruption of our business may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses, including the loss of time as well as the costs of lost opportunities, and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.obtaining regulatory approval in the united states does not ensure we will obtain regulatory approval in other countries. we will aim to obtain regulatory approval in the united states as well as in other countries. to obtain regulatory approval to market our proposed products outside of the united states, we and any collaborator must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements in other countries regarding safety and efficacy. approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ significantly from that required to obtain fda approval. the regulatory approval process in other countries include all of the risk associated with fda approval as well as additional, presently unanticipated risks. regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects associated with regulatory approval in the united states, including the risk that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. in addition, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in other countries can result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution.if we are unable to design, conduct and complete clinical trials successfully, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our products. in order to obtain fda approval for some of our product candidates, we must submit to the fda a new drug application, or nda, demonstrating that the product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use. this demonstration requires significant research and animal tests, which are referred to as preclinical studies, as well as human tests, which are referred to as clinical trials. any clinical trials we conduct or that are conducted by our partners may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy of our product candidates. success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. results of later clinical trials may not replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. even if the results of one or more of our clinical trials are positive, we may have to commit substantial time and additional resources to conducting further preclinical studies or clinical trials before we can submit ndas or obtain fda approvals for our product candidates, and positive results of a clinical trial may not be replicated in subsequent trials. clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement. the clinical trial process is also time-consuming. furthermore, if participating patients in clinical studies suffer drug-related adverse reactions during the course of such trials, or if we or the fda believe that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, we will have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials. failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat clinical studies. 15 in addition, the completion of clinical trials can be delayed by numerous factors, including: delays in identifying and agreeing on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment; increases in time required to complete monitoring of patients during or after participation in a trial; and unexpected need for additional patient-related data. any of these delays, if significant, could impact the timing, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and could significantly increase our overall costs of drug development. even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, their results may not support our expectations or intended marketing claims. the clinical trials process may fail to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for indicated uses. such failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate for some indications and could delay development of other product candidates.government agencies may establish usage guidelines that directly apply to our proposed products or change legislation or regulations to which we are subject. government usage guidelines typically address matters such as usage and dose, among other factors. application of these guidelines could limit the use of products that we may develop. in addition there can be no assurance that government regulations applicable to our proposed products or the interpretation thereof will not change and thereby prevent the marketing of some or all of our products for a period of time or permanently. the fdas policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the united states or in other countries.our product candidates may be classified as a drug or a medical device, depending on the indication of use and prior precedent, and a change in the classification may have an adverse impact on our revenues or our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. several potential indications for our product candidates may be regulated under the medical device regulations of the fda administered by the center for devices and radiological health or by the center for drug evaluation and research and the same physical product may be regulated by one such agency for one indication and the other agency for another indication. our products may be classified by the fda as a drug or a medical device depending upon the indications for use or claims. for example, for nvc-422, if the indication is for bladder lavage, we believe it would be classified as a medical device, whereas we believe it would be considered a drug when it is indicated for the prevention of urinary tract infection. similarly, the use of nvc-101 as a solution for cleansing and debriding wounds would be considered as a medical device. in addition, the determination as to whether a particular indication is considered a drug or a device is based in part u</th>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS The Common Stock offered hereby involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information in this Prospectus, the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in the shares of Common Stock offered by this Prospectus. This Prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Prospectus. Limited Operating History and History of Operating Losses. The Company has only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects. The Company commenced operations in November 1991 and introduced its first automatic service and support product, Win Win, in 1993 The Company introduced the first Windows 95 compatible version of its First Aid product line in September 1995. During 1996, both the Company's net revenues and operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing expenditures, increased rapidly compared to prior periods. From inception to June 30, 1996, the Company generated net revenues of $19.1 million, of which $13.9 million, or 73%, was generated in the six months ended June 30, 1996. The Company has incurred net losses in each of the last five fiscal years and for the six months ended June 30, 1996, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $7.8 million at June 30, 1996The Company's disproportionate increase in operating losses from 1992 through June 30, 1996 were primarily due to its policy of deferring revenue with no corresponding cost deferral. Approximately $3.0 million in net revenues were deferred as of June 30, 1996. In addition, since 1992, the Company's operating expenses have increased significantly as a result of efforts to expand its sales and marketing operations, including international sales, to fund greater levels of product development and to increase its administrative infrastructureManagement believes that it is not more likely than not that the Company will generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits of existing deferred assets as of June 30, 1996. See Note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of income taxes. There can be no assurance that the Company's net revenues will continue to remain at or increase from the level experienced in the first six months of 1996 or that net revenues will not decline. The Company anticipates that in the future it will make significant investments in its operations, particularly to support sales activities, and that as a result, operating expenses will increase significantly. The Company intends to make such investments on an ongoing basis, primarily from cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, funds available from the Company's line of credit and this offering, as the Company develops and introduces new products and expands into new markets such as international, corporate and OEM markets. If net revenues do not correspondingly increase, the Company is likely to continue to incur net losses and its financial condition will be materially adversely affected. The Company has not yet achieved profitability, and there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly basis or annual basis. Furthermore, operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties. The Company's prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies with limited operating histories, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. In addition, the Company's future operating results will depend upon, among other factors, the demand for the Company's software products, the level of product and price competition, the Company's success in expanding its direct and indirect distribution channels, the Company's success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified personnel, the ability of the Company to expand its international sales, develop and market new products and product upgrades and manage product transitions, the ability of the Company to control costs, the growth of activity on the Internet and the World Wide Web (the "Web"), and general economic conditions. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's control. If the Company is not successful in addressing such risks, the Company will be materially adversely affected. See "-- Potential Fluctuations in Quarterly Results; Seasonality," "-- Product Concentration; Risks Associated with First Aid Upgrades," "-- Developing Market" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Potential Fluctuations in Quarterly Results; Seasonality. The Company's quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations 5 6 may arise as a result of a number of factors, including the number and timing of new product introductions, upgrades and product enhancements by the Company or its competitors, purchasing patterns of distributors and customers, marketing and promotional programs, pricing and other competitive pressures, order deferrals and product returns in anticipation of new products or upgrades to existing products, the mix of distribution channels through which the Company's products are sold, the Company's decisions regarding hiring and other expenses, market acceptance of the Company's products, market acceptance of commerce over the Internet, technological limitations of the Internet, the developing nature of the market for the Company's products, general economic conditions and other factors. The Company generally ships products as orders are received and, accordingly, the Company has historically operated with relatively little backlog. As a result, quarterly revenues will depend predominantly on the volume and timing of orders received during a particular quarter, both of which are difficult to forecast. With the introduction of First Aid 95, the Company significantly increased its level of operating expenses. The Company anticipates that its operating expenses will continue to increase substantially in the future as a result of efforts to expand its sales and marketing operations, including expanding its international sales, to fund greater levels of product development, and to increase its administrative infrastructure. To the extent that such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased net revenues, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. A relatively high percentage of the Company's expenses is fixed in the short term and the Company is generally unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for shortfalls in net revenues. In addition, the consumer software industry in which the Company operates has seasonal elements. In recent years, the consumer software industry has experienced relatively higher demand for software products in the fourth quarter due to year-end holiday buying and relatively lower demand in the summer months. If net revenues fall below the Company's expectations, expenditure levels as a percentage of total net revenues could be disproportionately high, and operating results would be immediately and adversely affected. The Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance. Due to the foregoing factors, among others, it is likely that the Company's future quarterly operating results from time to time will not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which may have an adverse effect on the price of the Company's Common Stock. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Product Concentration; Risks Associated with First Aid Upgrades. During 1995 and the first half of 1996, over 90% of the Company's net revenues were attributable to sales of its First Aid products. The Company anticipates that sales of its First Aid products will account for substantially all of the Company's net revenues during 1996, and a substantial majority of its net revenues in 1997. There can be no assurance that net revenues from the First Aid products will continue to grow at historical rates or be sustainable at current levels. The Company's future financial performance will depend in large part on the successful development, introduction and customer acceptance of new product offerings and enhanced versions of the First Aid products. The Company is currently upgrading its First Aid products to incorporate new features to respond to evolving technical support and competitive developments. These upgrades are scheduled to be released in the fourth quarter of 1996 under the First Aid 97 title. Distributors may delay or cancel orders and return or reduce current inventory levels of First Aid 95 products in anticipation of the release of these upgrades. Furthermore, any failure or delays in releasing First Aid 97 upgrades as announced could increase the risk of such actions by distributorsThe rate of growth of sales into the channel of First Aid 95 have declined somewhat since the public announcement of the expected release of First Aid 97 which the Company believes is due to such announcement. In order to enhance continued sales of First Aid 95, the Company has introduced a rebate program for buyers of First Aid 95 and First Aid 95 Deluxe and has extended credit terms to certain customers. The First Aid 97 upgrades will not be available until mid to late fourth quarter 1996. Delays in shipping such upgradees could have material adverse effect on the Company's future business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company recently introduced a new product, Oil Change, in October 1996. To date, Oil Change has not generated any net revenues and 6 7 the Company does not expect it to generate significant net revenues for at least the near future. There can be no assurance that Oil Change will generate significant net revenues at any time in the future. Any decline in the demand for First Aid products, failure to achieve market acceptance of upgrades to such products or failure of net revenues derived from such products to meet the Company's expectations, whether as a result of competition, technological change or other factors, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Business -- Products," and "-- Technology." Management of Growth; Dependence on Key Personnel. The Company's business has grown rapidly during the past year and such growth has placed and, if sustained, will continue to place, significant demands on the Company's management and resources. Recently, the Company has significantly increased the scale of its operations to support increased sales volumes and to address critical infrastructure and other requirements. This increase included substantial investments in sales and marketing to support sales activities and the hiring of a number of new employees, which have resulted in higher operating expenses. Between December 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996, the number of Company employees increased from approximately 20 to approximately 104 and the Company currently expects to hire many additional employees during 1996. The Company's ability to manage any future growth, should it occur, will continue to depend upon the successful expansion of its sales, marketing, research and development, customer support and administrative infrastructure and the ongoing implementation and improvement of a variety of internal management systems, procedures and controls. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract, manage and retain additional personnel to support any future growth or will not experience significant problems with respect to any infrastructure expansion or the attempted implementation of systems, procedures and controlsAny failure in one or more of these areas would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The Company's future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain its key technical employees or that it will be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical personnel in the future. Any inability to attract and retain the necessary technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is dependent upon certain of its executive officers and has entered into employment agreements with certain of its executive officers in order to help assure their retention by the Company. However, there can be no assurance that any such employment agreements will sufficiently incentivize such executive officers to remain with the Company. The Company does not maintain any key person insurance policies on the lives of any of its executive officers. The loss of or inability to retain these key executive officers for any reason could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management." Competition. The PC software industry is intensely competitive and characterized by short product life cycles and frequent new product introductions. The Company competes with software companies of varying sizes and resources, including SystemSoft Corporation, Quarterdeck Corporation, Symantec Corp. and others. The Company believes that a number of software companies will be introducing automatic service and support software products in the near future that will compete with the Company's products. The Company expects that potential future competitors may include other software vendors, including Internet software vendors. Many of the Company's existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Company. Moreover, there are no proprietary barriers to entry that could keep existing and potential competitors from developing similar products or selling competing products in the Company's markets. To the extent that the Company's competitors bundle their software products with leading hardware, application software or operating system vendors, or if one or more of the operating system vendors, 7 8 such as Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), developed its own technical support software and incorporated such functionality into its products, the Company's business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully with existing or potential competitors. Increased competition may result in the loss of shelf space or a reduction in demand or sell-through of the Company's products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Microsoft's position as a large, well-capitalized software company with a dominant share of the market for PC operating system software could enable it to develop products that compete effectively with those of the Company. In particular, Microsoft is incorporating "Plug and Play" capabilities into future versions of its operating systems. Plug and Play capabilities are designed to allow PC users to add on any computer peripheral (such as a modem, video or sound card) to a Windows-based system and enable that peripheral to work immediately, without concern for software configuration errors or driver conflicts. In addition, to the extent that Microsoft incorporates functionality comparable, or perceived as comparable, to that offered by the Company into its Windows products (or separately offers comparable products), sales of the Company's products could be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurance that any such action by Microsoft or others would not render the Company's products noncompetitive or obsolete. The Company's products also compete indirectly against alternative sources of technical support, such as the technical support departments of hardware and software vendors. Additionally, the Internet provides hardware and software vendors with a new medium to offer technical support services. The Company expects that many vendors will provide Internet-based technical support services to support their existing and future products. The availability of these technical support services could materially dilute the value of the Company's products and have a material adverse effect on the Company's market position, business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Industry Background." In addition, the Company may face increasing pricing pressures from current and future competitors and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not require the Company to reduce its prices. Any material reduction in the price of the Company's products would negatively affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, and would require the Company to increase unit sales in order to maintain historic levels of net revenues. There can be no assurance that competitors will not develop products that are superior to the Company's products or that achieve greater market acceptance and thereby negatively affect sales of the Company's products. See "Business -- Distribution and Marketing" and "-- Competition." Dependence on Microsoft Windows. The Company's success is dependent on the continued widespread use of the Windows operating systems for PCs. The Company's First Aid products automatically detect, diagnose and resolve common software conflicts and configuration errors arising in the Windows operating environmentAlthough Windows operating systems are currently used by many PC users, other companies, including International Business Machines Corporation and Apple Computer, Inc., have developed or are developing other operating systems that compete, or will compete, with Windows. In the event that any of these alternative operating systems become widely accepted in the PC marketplace, demand for the Company's products could be adversely affected, thereby materially adversely affecting the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Microsoft may introduce a new operating system to replace Windows or could incorporate some or many of the key features of the Company's First Aid products in new versions of its operating systems, thereby eliminating the need for users to purchase the Company's products. The inability to adapt current products or to develop new products for use with any new operating systems on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company's ability to develop products based on Windows operating systems and release these products immediately prior to, or at the time of Microsoft's release of new and upgraded 8 9 Windows products is substantially dependent on its ability to gain pre-release access to, and to develop expertise in, current and future versions of WindowsThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to provide products that are compatible with future Windows releases on a timely basis, with or without the cooperation of Microsoft. Developing Market. The Company's products address the new and rapidly evolving market for automatic service and support software. The market for automatic service and support software products has only recently begun to develop and is characterized by an increasing number of existing and potential market entrants who are in the process of introducing or developing automatic service and support software. As is typical in the case of a new and rapidly evolving market, the demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. It is difficult to predict the future growth rate and size of this market. There can be no assurance that the market for the Company's products will develop, that demand for the Company's products or for automatic service and support software products in general will increase or that the rate of growth of this demand will be sustainable or will not decrease. The Company's ability to develop and successfully market additional products depends substantially on the acceptance of automatic service and support software by individual and corporate users as an effective means of addressing their technical support requirements. If the market fails to develop, develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors, or if the Company's products do not achieve or sustain market acceptance, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Business -- Industry Background" and "Business -- Products." New Product Development and Technological Change. Substantially all of the Company's net revenues have been derived, and substantially all of the Company's future net revenues are expected to be derived, from the sale of its automatic service and support software products. The market for automatic service and support software products is characterized by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The Company's products must be continually updated to address the new and evolving technical support requirements of third-party hardware and software. Failure to anticipate technical difficulties that arise from use of these third-party products and incorporate solutions to such difficulties into the Company's products would have a material adverse effect on continued market acceptance of the Company's products. The Company's ability to design, develop, test and support on a timely basis new software products, updates and enhancements that respond to technological developments and emerging industry standards is critical to the Company's future success. The Company is currently upgrading its First Aid products and expects these upgrades to be released in the fourth quarter of 1996. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in such efforts or that the Company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products and enhancements, or that its new products, upgrades and enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. The introduction of new products, upgrades or enhanced versions of existing products is subject to the risk of development delays due to resource constraints, technological change and other reasons. If the Company is unable to develop on a timely basis new software products, upgrades or enhancements to existing products or if such new products, upgrades or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Business -- Products," " -- Technology" and " -- Product Development." The Company currently employs software engineers in India on a work-for-hire basis. These engineers are primarily responsible for updating the Company's knowledge bases for current applications and upgrades. Certain of these engineers are responsible for adapting the Company's First Aid products to Windows NT. Any loss of the services of these engineers due to political or economic instability or for any other reason could adversely affect the Company's product development efforts 9 10 and thereby could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Product Development." Dependence on Distribution Channels. The Company currently sells its First Aid products primarily through distributors for resale to the retail channel and through direct mail. Sales to such distributors and sales through direct mail accounted for approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, of the Company's net revenues in the first six months of 1996. Sales from direct mail have historically operated at lower profitability levels than sales from distributors. Accordingly, quarterly shifts in the mix of sales through distributors and through direct mail could cause fluctuations in the Company's profitability. There can be no assurance that the mix or relative profitability of such sales will remain at current levels in the future. The Company is evaluating the use of alternative distribution channels for its products and began distributing Oil Change through the Internet in October 1996. Sales to a limited number of distributors have constituted and are expected to continue to constitute a substantial portion of the Company's net revenuesSales to the Company's top three distributors, Navarre Corporation ("Navarre"), Ingram Micro, Inc. ("Ingram Micro") and Micro Central, Inc. ("Micro Central"), accounted for approximately 22%, 20% and 11%, respectively, of the Company's net revenues in the six months ended June 30, 1996. The loss of, or reduction in, orders from any of these distributors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial conditionHistorically, margins for distributors in the PC software industry have been low, competition has been intense and distributors have relied on timely payments from their customers. In September 1996, NeoStar Retail Group, Inc. ("NeoStar"), a major PC software retailer and a reseller of the Company's products, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In the event that NeoStar is unable to come to a satisfactory resolution with its creditors, it may cause financial difficulties for one or more PC software distributors, including those of the Company. Financial difficulties of any distributors could render the Company's associated accounts receivable uncollectible, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any special distribution arrangements or product pricing arrangements that the Company may implement for strategic purposes in one or more of its distribution channels could materially adversely affect its margins. The distribution channels through which consumer software products are sold have been characterized by rapid change, including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain distributors and retailers and the emergence of new retailers such as general mass merchandisers. In addition, due to an increase in the number of software applications, there are an increasing number of companies competing for access to these channels. Retailers of the Company's products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition for high quality and adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support from the retailers. The Company believes this competition for shelf space will increase in the near term as competitors introduce new automatic service and support software. There can be no assurance that retailers will continue to purchase the Company's products or provide the Company's products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support, the lack of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business -- Distribution and Marketing." Risk of Product Returns. The Company's business includes a substantial risk of product returns from distributors, retailers and end users, either through the exercise of contractual return rights or as a result of the Company's policy of assisting customers in balancing and updating inventories. Individual end users may return products within 60 days of the date of purchase for a full refund. Most retailers, distributors and end users also have the ability to return products for a full refund. In addition, competitors' promotional or other activities could cause returns to increase sharply at any time. Further, the rate of product returns could increase if general mass merchandisers become a larger percentage of the Company's business or other changes in the Company's distribution channel occur. Large shipments in anticipation of unrealized demand can lead to overstocking by the Company's distributors or retailers and result in substantial product returns. In addition, the inventory transition resulting from the introduction of product upgrades, including the currently planned 10 11 introduction of First Aid 97, could result in an increased level of returns for prior versions. Furthermore, the risk of product returns will increase if demand for the Company's products declines. Although the Company establishes reserves based on estimated future returns of products, taking into account promotional activities, the timing of new product introductions, distributor and retailer inventories of the Company's products and other factors, there can be no assurance that actual levels of returns will not significantly exceed amounts anticipated by the Company. In addition, the Company provides price protection to its distributors in the event the Company reduces its prices. While to date, the number of products returned to the Company has been immaterial, there can be no assurance that the number of returns will not significantly increase in the future. Any material increase in the level of returns could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Business -- Distribution and Marketing." Dependence on the Internet. The commercial viability of Oil Change and the Company's ability to execute its strategy to leverage Oil Change as an Internet-based platform for other products and services are dependent upon the continued development and acceptance of the Internet as a delivery medium for third-party software programs. In addition, the Company's future success may be dependent upon continued growth in the use of the Internet in order to support the distribution of products and future upgrades. The use of the Internet as a distribution channel is new and unproven and represents a significant departure from traditional distribution methods employed by software companies. Critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet (including security, reliability, cost, ease of use and access and speed) remain unresolved and may affect the use of the Internet as a medium to distribute software. There can be no assurance that the use of the Internet as a distribution channel will be effective for either current or future products. The failure of the Internet to be an effective distribution channel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and prospects. The Company's future success depends, in part, upon the future growth of the Internet for commercial transactions. There can be no assurance that communication or commerce over the Internet will become widespread and it is not known whether this market will develop to the extent necessary for demand for the Company's products to emerge and become sustainable. The Internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons, including inadequate communications bandwidth and a lack of secure payment mechanisms. To the extent that the Internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and level of use, there can be no assurance that the Internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed upon it. Moreover, the Internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or ado</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this prospectus before you decide whether to invest in shares of our class a common stock. our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results or cash flows may be materially and adversely affected by the following risks, or other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or currently consider to be immaterial. in that event, the trading price of our class a common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our businessour business has experienced significant losses and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. through the end of december 2004, we have spent approximately $1.2 billion in connection with the development and launch of our business. to date, the build-out of our infrastructure and our day-to-day operations have been financed substantially by our financing activities, and we have had limited revenue from operations. as of december 31, 2004, we had incurred aggregate losses of approximately $2.1 billion. we plan to dedicate significant resources to our current business strategy, including increased marketing and construction of terrestrial repeater networks in india, development of next generation mobile receivers and launch of service in china and western europe. in addition, to the extent we have positive annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda), we are required to make payments of 10% of our ebitda under our royalty agreement with stonehouse capital limited (stonehouse). we anticipate that, in the near term, we will continue to rely on the proceeds from our private placement of senior convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $155 million in december 2004, the proceeds from our private placement of shares of class a common stock to xm for an aggregate purchase price of $25 million in july 2005 and the proceeds from this offering to sustain our operations. in the future, we will need to generate significant revenue in order to achieve a profit from operations, and we can offer you no assurance that we will ever become profitable.there may not be sufficient demand for our service to allow us to become profitable. we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the potential market demand in our target markets for a subscription-based digital satellite radio service or the degree to which our service will meet such market demand. we will achieve or fail to gain market acceptance depending upon many factors, some of which are not within our control, including: whether we can offer sufficient high-quality programming consistent with our potential customers preferences; the willingness of consumers, on a mass-market basis, to pay subscription fees to obtain satellite radio broadcasts; the extent to which we can limit customer turnover, either as a result of customers electing voluntarily to discontinue our service (including customers who discontinue following rate increases at the end of any promotion) or as a result of customers being discontinued due to nonpayment; the cost, availability and consumer acceptance of receivers capable of receiving our broadcasts; our marketing and pricing strategies, as well as those of our receiver manufacturers; competition from other media and entertainment in our target markets; the development of alternative technologies or services; and the general economic, political and social conditions in our target markets. risk factors if for any reason we cannot achieve a rapid and significant level of consumer acceptance for our service, we may not achieve the market penetration rates necessary for us to execute our business plan successfully. high subscriber acquisition costs could adversely affect our profitability. in order to attract subscribers to our service in india, we are subsidizing a portion of the costs of purchasing the lowest-cost receiver capable of receiving our broadcast that is offered in our indian market. we intend to continue to subsidize a portion of the costs of purchasing receivers in our indian market and in other markets as we introduce our service. we are also in the process of launching a large advertising and sales campaign and other promotional activities as we roll out our services in different markets in india. consequently, our subscriber acquisition costs are expected to increase substantially. our subscriber acquisition costs may increase even further if we determine that more aggressive advertising, promotions or other marketing efforts are necessary to promote faster subscriber growth or to respond to competition, or are otherwise advisable. if these subscriber acquisition costs become sufficiently high they could materially adversely affect our financial performance.we may not be able to compete effectively against conventional radio stations or other potential providers of consumer audio services. in seeking market acceptance, we will encounter competition for both listeners and future advertising revenue from many sources, including traditional and, when available, digital am/fm radio, shortwave radio, internet based audio providers, direct broadcast satellite television audio service, systems that carry audio service and digital music players. we could also face competition from terrestrial digital radio services in the future, although such services are not currently offered in india or china, our two immediate target markets. unlike our service, traditional am/fm radio already has a well-established market presence for its services and generally offers free-to-air broadcast reception supported by commercial advertising, rather than by a subscription fee. also, many radio stations offer information programming of a local nature, such as news and sports reports, which we may not be able to offer as effectively as local radio stations. to the extent that consumers place a high value on these features of traditional am/fm radio, we are at a competitive disadvantage to the traditional providers of audio entertainment services. in addition, although potential competition in our target markets with other satellite broadcast radio services is limited by regulatory and other restrictions, such competition could emerge. if an alternative satellite radio broadcast system that is comparable or superior to our system were to be introduced in our target markets, or if any competitor were to begin offering another mobile dars before we do, we could experience competitive pressure or be at a competitive disadvantage.our independent auditors have identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal controls, and if we are unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate controls we will not be able to comply with applicable regulatory requirements imposed on reporting companies. we have experienced severe working capital constraints for several years and, as a result, we have operated with very limited staffing of key functions, including accounting. we have also experienced turnover of our accounting staff, including the replacement of our chief financial officer and the loss of our controller in september 2004. these circumstances have increased demands on our internal accounting and financial staff. our independent auditors have identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal controls in their 2004 internal control letter to us. we have engaged pricewaterhousecoopers as a third-party consultant with respect to the development of appropriate internal controls. we have also recruited and hired two key senior accounting and finance employees at the senior vice president level, risk factors one to serve as our corporate controller, the other to help enhance internal controls and other systems to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. we are also actively hiring additional staff to augment our accounting and finance functions. we are in the process of establishing such new and enhanced systems of internal controls as we believe necessary to allow management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest to, our internal controls, as required by the management certification and auditor attestation requirements mandated by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. we will be performing system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) of our internal control system on an ongoing basis. while we anticipate being able to implement fully the requirements relating to internal controls and all other applicable requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 in a timely fashion, we cannot be certain as to the timing of the completion of our evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation or the impact of the same on our operations. our development, implementation and maintenance of appropriate internal controls will depend materially both on our successful hiring and retention of key senior accounting personnel. in addition to addressing the accounting and internal controls of our current operations, our employees and systems will have to accommodate increasingly complex financial reporting demands as we expand our operations in india and as we introduce our services in other markets, including china. we will also have to be able to retain and attract appropriately qualified personnel in key staff areas to maintain an effective accounting and internal controls system. if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, to implement and integrate financial reporting and accounting systems or if we are unable to scale these systems to our growth, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations or comply with the requirements of the sec, the nasdaq national market or the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, which could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the suspension or delisting of our class a common stock from the nasdaq national market and the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our class a common stock, or investigation by regulatory authorities. any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. our satellites have a limited life and may fail in orbit. satellites utilize highly complex technology and, accordingly, are subject to in-orbit failures after they have been successfully placed into operation. our afristar satellite was launched in october 1998, and our asiastar satellite was launched in march 2000. our satellites are designed to operate in orbit for approximately 12 years after launch. after this period, our satellites performance in delivering our service may deteriorate. each satellite has an orbital maneuver life of 15 years, which means that each satellite has been designed to maintain its assigned orbital position (within 0.1 degrees) for 15 years. the useful life of our satellites may vary from our estimate. if one of our satellites were to fail or suffer significant performance degradation prematurely and unexpectedly, it would cause interruption in the continuity of our service or impair the quality of our service. a number of factors could decrease the useful lives of our in-orbit satellites, including: expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels; defects in the quality of construction; failure of satellite components or systems that are not protected by back-up units; loss of the on-board station-keeping system that maintains the geosynchronous position; unexpected increase in use of fuel; and in rare cases, damage or destruction by electrostatic storms or collisions with other objects in space. risk factors our afristar satellite has developed a defect in its solar panels. the panels are collecting less power than intended, and we expect that this will affect that satellites operation starting in 2008. at that time we will need to make an operating decision regarding the use of our afristar satellite, since it would be possible to extend the useful life of the satellite through careful management of the power generated by the solar array. this may require broadcasting a smaller number of channels over one or more of its beams in order to conserve power or reducing the power radiated by one or more of its beams with a resulting reduction of the broadcast coverage area. our target markets of india and china are served by the asiastar satellite and are not affected by the performance of our afristar satellite. our insurance may not cover all risks of operating our satellites. we currently maintain in-orbit insurance coverage for our asiastar and afristar satellites, which would reimburse us for a portion of the insured satellite value in the event of a partial loss or for the full insured value in the event of a total loss, subject to stipulated deductibles and exclusions. each satellites current policy is for one year, and we anticipate that our in-orbit insurance policies will continue to be on a year-to-year basis, which has become standard in the industry. the company believes, based on its recent negotiations with respect to obtaining in-orbit insurance for afristar, and assuming afristar does not sustain any further unexpected deterioration, that the company will continue to be able to procure in-orbit insurance for both satellites. however, even when obtained, in-orbit insurance for a satellite will not protect against all losses to a satellite. our current insurance policies contain specified exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations. moreover, although we intend to maintain insurance on our asiastar and afristar satellites, any determination we make as to whether to maintain in-orbit insurance coverage will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of insurance in the market and the cost of available insurance. we will also consider the exclusions to coverage, if any, required by insurers and the other terms and conditions upon which the insurance is available. even if we seek to obtain replacement insurance in the future, we may not be able to obtain this insurance on reasonable terms and conditions. moreover, this insurance coverage may be costly, if available at all. the cost of insurance may increase or its terms may become disadvantageous with respect to exclusions and deductibles as a result of several factors, including the failure or degradation of performance of one of our in-orbit satellites or the failure of a similar satellite owned by another operator. in addition to other material, adverse effects on us, the partial or total loss of an uninsured satellite would cause us to recognize a loss equal to the book value of any such total loss or, in the case of a partial loss, an amount equal to the proportion of the satellites book value corresponding to such partial loss.our on-ground satellites may be damaged or destroyed during launch. in addition to afristar and asiastar, we have two additional satellites, one fully assembled satellite (f3) and another satellite (f4) for which the long lead parts have been procured and partially assembled, which are currently maintained in storage in toulouse, france. we have accepted risk of loss for these satellites and maintain ground insurance for both these satellites. the f3 satellite, which can be used to replace either afristar or asiastar, may also be modified and launched to provide dars in western europe. in such case, it is envisioned that the f4 satellite, upon full assembly, would be maintained as an on-ground spare satellite that could be launched in the event that one of our other three satellites experiences an in-orbit failure. the launch of a satellite is subject to significant risks, including launch failure, satellite destruction or damage during launch or failure to achieve proper orbital placement. launch failure rates vary depending on the particular launch vehicle and contractor, which have not yet been determined with respect to the companys f3 and f4 satellites. if the launch of either our f3 or f4 satellite were to fail, result in destruction or material damage during launch or fail to achieve proper orbital placement, we would suffer, in addition to any cost relating to building or procuring a replacement satellite and launching such satellite that are not covered by insurance, a significant disruption in the development of the relevant portion of our business as well as a significant impact on our earnings as a result of the delay in revenue producing activities. risk factors because the vast majority of our revenue will be derived from operations outside the united states, while our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, changes in the exchange rates between the local currencies of our operations and the u.s. dollar could materially affect our reported results of operation. we anticipate that the vast majority of our revenue will be derived from our operations outside the united states, particularly india, china and western europe. we present our consolidated financial statements in u.s. dollars. accordingly, changes in the exchange rates between the local currencies of our operations and the u.s. dollar could materially affect the translation of financial results into u.s. dollars for purposes of reporting our financial results. because we report our financial results in u.s. dollars, our consolidated financial statements will include gains and losses from foreign currency translation adjustments, and these adjustments could have a material impact on our reported results of operations and could result in significant period-to-period fluctuations in our reported results of operations which are not attributable to, and may be at variance with, our actual business performance. exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the relative values of working capital advances between our various subsidiaries and of payments to and receipts from third parties, the effects of which impact our results of operations.royalty payments to stonehouse could materially limit our available working capital and negatively impact our results of operations. we have significant contingent annual payment obligations for the next ten years under our royalty agreement with stonehouse. we are obligated to pay to stonehouse 10% of our annual ebitda, if any, for each annual period through december31, 2015. in addition, we must maintain a segregated reserve account to be funded in each quarter of any year in which ebitda is forecast to be positive at the rate of 25% of the estimated annual payment. the royalty agreement also places certain limitations on our ability to freely dispose of assets. the royalty payment and reserve account obligation and the restrictions imposed by the royalty agreement could limit our cash flow and funds available for our working capital, and could result in a charge against our earnings which could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations. see pre-offering recapitalization and certain relationships and related party transactions.we may incur significant delays and expense in the development and installation of terrestrial repeater transmitters, and we cannot be certain that the systems will function properly. our planned introduction of a mobile service in india requires the installation of a network of terrestrial repeating transmitters (terrestrial repeaters), which serve as gap fillers to avoid signal disruption in the markets in which we plan to offer mobile products. the eventual roll-out of our mobile services in china and western europe will also require the installation of networks of terrestrial repeaters. we intend to install terrestrial repeaters to rebroadcast our satellite signals in various cities in india as we expand our terrestrial network and roll out our services. we are currently developing newtechnology for the future terrestrial repeaters in cooperation with sed systems, a division of calian ltd. we may experience significant delays in deploying the repeater network in india if the terrestrial repeater technology turns out to be more complex than we currently expect. moreover, since we rely on sed to provide key technical expertise, personnel-related delays may be outof our control. as our current receivers are not compatible with the terrestrial repeaters, we will alsoneed to offer a next generation of receivers that can receive these rebroadcasts as well as broadcasts directly from our satellites. until we have installed and tested a substantial portion of the new equipment we cannot be certain that our mobile dars will function using the terrestrial repeaters. in addition, some areas may still experience dead zones and we may incur additional costs to install terrestrial repeaters to cover these areas. we also may experience significant delays and expense in the implementation of our current plan to install risk factors terrestrial repeaters in the event that third-parties with existing terrestrial repeater networks, including radio broadcasters, upon whom we may be relying to secure optimal sites and install our terrestrial repeater network, do not cooperate with us or do not act in a timely and effective manner. we may also experience signal interference with our new receivers in india and later in china and western europe, due to terrestrial transmissions in portions of the l band spectrum. when we identify a signal that is interfering with our terrestrial rebroadcasts, we will seek to negotiate a solution with the local operator of the transmitter. however, we may not always be able to reach a timely agreement through the relevant government authorities responsible for frequency management that will allow our customers to receive our service without any interference. we may be unable to obtain the authorizations required to operate our terrestrial repeater networks in india or to retain the necessary authorizations to operate a subscription service. the indian government does not currently have a regulatory framework or written policy governing satellite radio services, and we are presently the only satellite radio services provider in the country. we have received the government authorizations that are presently required to provide our existing subscription service and to import our current receivers. however, in order to deploy complementary terrestrial repeaters in india, we will be required to obtain spectrum allocation and transmitter authorizations and may also be required to obtain service licenses. in addition, the indian government may require that we obtain additional authorizations or licenses or may impose restrictions on our business. moreover, in the recommendation paper issued on june 27, 2005 the telecom regulatory authority of india (trai) recommended to the indian government that a revenue share fee of 4% of gross earnings generated in india be imposed if the satellite broadcaster uses terrestrial repeaters. further, the indian government is planning to issue regulations governing dars, and such regulations may require us to obtain additional authorizations or licenses or impose restrictions on our business. in addition, trai has also recommended that the indian government regulate content of dars providers. any failure to obtain any required licenses or further authorizations or any material changes in our current authorizations or imposition of any additional restrictions could adversely affect our ability to carry out our business plan in india. given the lack of mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms at the international telecommunication union, there is no guarantee that the frequencies used by afristar and asiastar will be protected from interference from non-conforming uses. even though the afristar and asiastar frequency assignments have completed coordination and notification procedures under the international telecommunication union (itu) and therefore enjoy priority over other uses, there is no guarantee that the use of those frequencies will be protected from interference from non-conforming uses by other administrations. in the event that harmful interference is caused by a non-conforming frequency assignment, the itu procedures described in article 8 and article 15 of the radio regulations would apply. while these procedures set forth the good faith obligations to resolve any such interference, they do not contain mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms. rather, the radio regulations dispute resolution procedures are based on the willingness of the parties concerned to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. neither the itu specifically, nor international law generally, provides clear remedies if this voluntary process fails. since the frequency band that can be used for broadcasting-satellite service (sound) is limited to 25 mhz (1,4671,492 mhz) and our two satellites combined occupy virtually all of that spectrum, it may not be possible to eliminate interference by changing frequencies in the area(s) affected. risk factors we may experience delays and incur significant costs in the development and production of our receivers. the timely manufacture and distribution of our receivers at a price that is attractive to consumers is a critical factor in the execution of our business plan. the receivers for our indian market are manufactured by a limited number of third-party vendors. we expect the same will be true for the receivers for our chinese market. because the current market for our receivers is limited, the financial incentive for manufacturers to produce significant quantities of our receivers at an attractive price is similarly limited. if we are unable to maintain established relationships with our manufacturers or develop comparable relationships with new vendors, we could experience delays in the development, supply and availability of our receivers at acceptable quality and price levels. our business plan also depends on the reduction of the cost of our receivers in order to make them available to consumers at an attractive price. currently, to encourage sales of our receivers, we subsidize our lowest-cost receivers in india. we expect that in the near term future, we will need to continue to subsidize the cost of our receivers by offering them to distributors at a price below their cost to us. if we cannot reduce such subsidies in the future, our earnings and results of operations will be negatively affected.our next generation of receivers will eventually replace our current receivers, which may result in increased costs, higher subscriber turnover, or lower receiver sales. in connection with the introduction of our mobile dars and the introduction of our next generation of receivers, we intend to begin broadcasting our signal in a modified waveform. our current receivers will not be able to decode the modified waveform signal. while we intend to broadcast in both waveforms for a period of time, we will eventually cease broadcasting in the older waveform. we will have to transition our subscribers from the older receivers to our next generation receivers. because our next generation of receivers will, when introduced, be more expensive than our existing receivers, we will face increased costs to the extent we decide to subsidize the transition of our current subscribers to our next generation receivers. in addition, new customers may not be willing to pay for the higher priced new receivers. we may also experience higher subscriber turnover if existing subscribers decide not to purchase a new receiver.our ability to conduct our business in china may be adversely affected if we cannot maintain our relationship with chinasat or another licensed chinese telecommunications operator and obtain approval for our content from the appropriate chinese regulatory authorities. our next critical target market after india is china. due to the ownership restrictions under chinese law and our intention to broadcast chinese programming through an uplink station in beijing, we have depended on china satellite communication corporation (chinasat), in which we have no ownership, to obtain the necessary regulatory authorizations from the ministry of information industry (mii) and the chinese state administration of radio, film and television (sarft). chinasat, as our agent, has acquired the required government approvals for spectrum allocation and is seeking additional approvals necessary for operating satellite transmission services in china. we are also a party to two active agreements with chinese companies to manufacture the receivers necessary for our customers to receive our service. we will also need to partner with local institutions to obtain regulatory approval from sarft for our audio content broadcast by our service and approval from the appropriate chinese regulatory authorities for data content. our ability to execute our business plan in china will depend on our relationship with chinasat (or with another of the licensed chinese telecommunications operators that are able to obtain and hold the necessary spectrum and operations licenses), the mii and sarft. therefore, any disruption in these relationships could materially delay or impair the implementation of our china business plan and our future profits. moreover, there can be no assurance that chinasat (or such other operator) or other future local partners will obtain the necessary licenses or approvals. in addition, should chinasat or any other entity with which we partner in china fail to perform its risk factors obligations under our agreements, we may have to rely on legal remedies under chinese law. the laws and regulations relating to contractual arrangements and foreign investment in china are relatively new and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties, which could limit our ability to enforce these agreements in china. failure of our ground network infrastructure would adversely affect our ability to broadcast content up to our satellites. we rely on our ground network infrastructure, including our satellite control network and our broadcast facilities, for key operations, including transmitting broadcast signals up to our satellites. we have limited broadcast facilities to transmit content to our satellites for broadcast to our customers. we rely primarily on our singapore uplink station, which is hosted by singapore telecom, to transmit content to our indian market, as our melbourne, australia uplink station only has the transmitting capacity to transmit approximately four channels. our uplink stations were uniquely built for us and, therefore, it will take a significant amount of time to obtain replacement parts in the event they are needed. if a natural or other disaster significantly damaged our broadcast system, particularly our singapore uplink station, if key parts were to fail for any reason, or if singapore telecom failed to support the singapore uplink station properly or terminated their host services contract, our ability to provide service to subscribers, at least on an interim basis, would be limited substantially.we have faced in the past, and may face in the future, challenges and constraints in obtaining financing. there can be no assurance that we will not need to raise additional financing to carry out our current business plan. we have faced, and in the future may continue to face, many challenges and constraints in financing our development and operations. for several years we have experienced severe working capital constraints and have incurred substantial delays in implementing our business plan largely as a result of our inability to raise financing. for example, prior to 2005, financing shortfalls forced us to limit our indian marketing effort and the roll-out of our services. we cannot guarantee that in the future we will not experience periods where we have limited funding and difficulty in raising any necessary capital on favorable terms, if at all. during any such period, we would continue to need significant amounts of cash to fund our capital expenditures, administrative and overhead costs, and contractual obligations. in such circumstances, if we were not able to obtain additional financing, we could be forced to curtail, or even cease, operations</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors an investment in our common stock offered by this prospectus involves a substantial risk of loss. you should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this prospectus, before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations. risks related to our business we are an early stage company with a history of losses. we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. we have incurred net losses since our inception. for the years ended december31, 2004, 2005, and 2006 we had net losses of approximately $2.8 million, $3.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively, and for the six months ended june 30, 2007 we had a net loss of approximately $2.5 million. through june 30, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $15.5 million. to date, we have been, and expect to remain for the foreseeable future, mostly in a research and development stage. since our inception, we have not generated revenue, except for modest revenue in 2006 and 2007 relating to two research and development collaboration and license agreements. we have incurred substantial research and development expenses, which were approximately $1.5 million, $2.0million and $4.1 million for the years ended december31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, and $3.5million for the six months ended june 30, 2007. we expect to continue to make, for at least the next several years, significant expenditures for the development of products that incorporate our aganocide compounds, as well as continued research into the biological activities of our aganocide compounds, which expenditures are accounted for as research and development expenses. we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercialized within the next several years, if at all, except as may be commercialized pursuant to our agreement with an affiliate of kinetic concepts, inc., pursuant to which we granted them the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize nvc-101, as well as other products containing hypochlorous acid as the principal active ingredient, worldwide for use in wound care in humans, other than products or uses intended for the eye, ear or nose. we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable. we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we: conduct pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates in different indications; seek regulatory clearances and approvals for our product candidates; develop, formulate, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates either independently or with partners; pursue, acquire or in-license additional compounds, products or technologies, or expand the use of our technology; maintain, defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property; and hire additional qualified personnel. we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. if we cannot successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates, either independently or with partners, we will not be able to generate such revenues or achieve or maintain profitability in the future. our failure to achieve and subsequently maintain profitability could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. our limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate our business and to assess our future viability. our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, developing our technology, researching and developing our compounds, and conducting preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials of our compounds. we have not demonstrated the ability to succeed in achieving clinical endpoints, obtain regulatory approvals, formulate and manufacture products on a commercial scale or conduct sales and marketing activities. consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability are unlikely to be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.we have very limited data on the use of our products in humans and will need to perform costly and time consuming clinical trials in order to bring our products to market. most of the data that we have on our products is from in-vitro (laboratory) studies or in-vivo animal studies. we will need to conduct phase i, ii and iii human clinical trials to confirm such results in order to obtain fda approval of our compounds. often, positive in-vitro or in-vivo animal studies are not followed by positive results in human clinical trials, and we may not be able to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for indicated uses in humans. in addition, for each indication, we estimate that it will take between three and five years to conduct the necessary clinical trials and will cost between $15 million and $30 million.we currently do not have any marketable products, and if we are unable to develop and obtain regulatory approval for products that we develop, we may never generate product revenues. to date, our revenues have been derived solely from two research and development collaboration and license agreements. we have never generated revenues from sales of products and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable drugs or other products. satisfaction of all regulatory requirements applicable to our product candidates typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity, novelty and classification of the product candidates, and requires the expenditure of substantial resources for research and development and testing. before proceeding with clinical trials, we will conduct pre-clinical studies, which may, or may not be, valid predictors of potential outcomes in humans. if pre-clinical studies are favorable, we will then begin clinical trials. we must demonstrate that our product candidates satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before we can submit for and gain approval from the u.s. food and drug administration, or fda, and other regulatory authorities in the united states and in other countries. in addition, to compete effectively, our products will need to be easy to use, cost-effective and economical to manufacture on a commercial scale. we may not achieve any of these objectives. we cannot be certain that the clinical development of any of our current product candidates or any other product that we may develop in the future will be successful, that they will receive the regulatory approvals required to commercialize them, or that any of our other in-licensing efforts or pre-clinical testing will yield a product suitable for entry into clinical trials. our commercial revenues from sales of products will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for at least the next several years, if at all.we have limited experience in developing drugs and medical devices, and we may be unable to commercialize any of the products we develop. development and commercialization of drugs and medical devices involves a lengthy and complex process. we have limited experience in developing products and have never received regulatory approval for, nor commercialized, any of our product candidates. in addition, no one has ever developed or commercialized a product based on our aganocide compounds, and we cannot assure you that it is possible to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any products based on these compounds or that we will be successful in doing so. 10 before we can develop and commercialize any new products, we will need to expend significant resources to: undertake and complete clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates; maintain and expand our intellectual property rights; obtain marketing and other approvals from the fda and other regulatory agencies; and select collaborative partners with suitable manufacturing and commercial capabilities. the process of developing new products takes several years. our product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including: the failure of our product candidates to demonstrate safety and efficacy; the high cost of clinical trials and our lack of financial and other resources; and our inability to partner with firms with sufficient resources to assist us in conducting clinical trials. success in early clinical trials often is not replicated in later studies, and few research and development projects result in commercial products. at any point, we may abandon development of a product candidate or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical trials, which would eliminate or adversely impact the timing for revenues from those product candidates. if a clinical study fails to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates, we may abandon the development of the product or product feature that was the subject of the clinical trial, which could harm our business. even if we develop products for commercial use, these products may not be accepted by the medical and pharmaceutical marketplaces or be capable of being offered at prices that will enable us to become profitable. we cannot assure you that our products will be approved by regulatory authorities or ultimately prove to be useful for commercial markets, meet applicable regulatory standards, or be successfully marketed.we do not have our own manufacturing capacity, and we plan to rely on partnering arrangements or third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our potential products. we do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our product candidates. we have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. as a result, we expect to partner with third parties to manufacture our products or rely on contract manufacturers to supply, store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. any performance failure on the part of our commercial partners or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and reducing the potential for product revenues. our products, if developed and commercialized, will require precise, high quality manufacturing. the failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards, including the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. contract manufacturers and partners often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. these manufacturers and partners are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or gmp, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards; however, we do not have control over third-party compliance with these regulations and standards. if any of our manufacturers or partners fails to maintain compliance, the production of our products could be interrupted, resulting in delays, additional costs and potentially lost revenues. 11 in addition, if the fda or other regulatory agencies approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale, we will need to manufacture them in larger quantities. significant scale-up of manufacturing will require validation studies, which the fda must review and approve. if we are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of any drugs may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply and our business may be harmed as a result.if we do not maintain our current research collaboration with alcon and kci and enter into additional collaborations, a portion of our funding may decrease and inhibit our ability to develop new products. we have entered into a collaborative arrangement with alcon manufacturing ltd. (alcon), and we rely on alcon for joint intellectual property creation and for substantially all of our near-term revenues. under the agreement, we licensed to alcon the exclusive rights (except for certain retained marketing rights) to develop, manufacture and commercialize products incorporating the aganocide compounds for application in connection with the eye, ear and sinus and for use in contact lens solutions. we have also entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of kinetic concepts, inc. pursuant to which we granted to them the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize our nvc-101 compound worldwide for use in wound care in humans (other than products or uses intended for the eye, ear or nose). under the terms of the alcon agreement, we received a non-refundable technology access fee of $10.0 million and are entitled to certain semi-annual payments for research and development conducted by us under the agreement for four years after the effective date of the agreement, unless alcon elects to extend this funding term. in addition, if certain milestones are achieved in connection with the development of a product, we are entitled to receive varying milestone payments for the first achievement of each such milestone for a licensed product in each field of use. under the terms of the agreement with the kinetic concepts affiliate (kci), we received a non-refundable technology access fee of $200,000 and will be entitled to receive additional amounts of up to $1.25 million if certain milestones are met. if products developed under these agreements are commercialized, we will also be entitled to receive royalty payments. we cannot assure you that our collaboration with alcon or kci or any other collaborative arrangement will be successful, or that we will receive the full amount of research funding, milestone payments or royalties, or that any commercially valuable intellectual property will be created, from these arrangements. if alcon or kci were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct its collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner, the research contemplated by our collaboration with them could be delayed or terminated and our costs of performing studies may increase. we plan on entering into additional collaborations and licensing arrangements. we may not be able to negotiate additional collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all, and these collaborations may not be successful. our current and future success depends in part on our ability to enter into successful collaboration arrangements and maintain the collaboration arrangement we currently have. if we are unable to enter into, maintain or extend successful collaborations, our business may be harmed.we may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures or in-license compounds that could disrupt our business, harm our operating results, dilute your ownership interest in us, or cause us to incur debt or significant expense. as part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and assets, and enter into technology or pharmaceutical compound licensing arrangements. we also may pursue strategic alliances that leverage our core technology and industry experience to enhance our ability to commercialize our product candidates and expand our product offerings or distribution. we have no experience with respect to acquiring other companies and limited experience with respect to the formation of commercial partnering agreements, strategic alliances, joint ventures or in-licensing of compounds. if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. if we in-license any additional compounds, we may fail to develop the product candidates, and spend significant resources before determining whether a compound we have in-licensed will produce revenues. any future acquisitions or in-licensing by us also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could harm our operating results. integration of an acquired company also may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing 12 development of our existing business. we may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture. to finance any acquisitions, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute your interest in us. if the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies for stock. alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions by incurring indebtedness. additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.we may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future which may in turn limit our ability to develop and commercialize products and technologies. we expect our capital outlays and operating expenditures to substantially increase over at least the next several years as we expand our product pipeline and increase research and development efforts and clinical and regulatory activities. conducting clinical trials is very expensive, and we expect that we will need to raise additional capital, through future private or public equity offerings, strategic alliances or debt financing, before we achieve commercialization of any of our aganocide compounds. in addition, we may require even more significant capital outlays and operating expenditures if we do not partner with a third party to develop and commercialize our products. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the scope, rate of progress and cost of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development activities; future clinical trial results; the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; the cost and timing of regulatory approvals; the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop; the effect of competing technological and market developments; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions. we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding. additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. even if we succeed in selling additional securities to raise funds, our existing shareholders ownership percentage would be diluted and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. if we raise additional capital through strategic alliance and licensing arrangements, we may have to trade our rights to our technology, intellectual property or products to others on terms that may not be favorable to us. if we raise additional capital through debt financing, the financing may involve covenants that restrict our business activities. in addition, it is often the case that the cost of pharmaceutical development can be significantly greater than initially anticipated. this may be due to any of a large number of possible reasons, some of which could have been anticipated, while others may be caused by unpredictable circumstances. a significant increase in our costs would cause the amount of financing that would be required to enable us to achieve our goals to be likewise increased. 13 if we determine that we need to raise additional funds and we are not successful in doing so, we may be unable to complete the clinical development of some or all of our product candidates or to seek or obtain fda approval of our product candidates. such events could force us to discontinue product development, enter into a relationship with a strategic partner earlier than currently intended, reduce sales and marketing efforts or forego attractive business opportunities.we depend on skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business effectively. if we are unable to recruit, hire and retain these employees, our ability to manage and expand our business will be harmed, which would impair our future revenue and profitability. our success largely depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our officers, especially our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, vice-president of research and development and vice president of medical affairs, and other key employees. the efforts of each of these persons is critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies and as we attempt to transition into a company with commercial products. any of our officers and other key employees may terminate their employment at any time. the loss of any of our senior management team members could weaken our management expertise and harm our ability to compete effectively, develop our technologies and implement our business strategies. our ability to retain our skilled labor force and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future. our research and development programs and collaborations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and technicians. we may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, particularly in the san francisco bay area. we also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel. we have also encountered difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel from outside the san francisco bay area, due to the high housing costs in the area.if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan. our future growth, if any, may cause a significant strain on our management, and our operational, financial and other resources. our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems and to expand, train, manage and motivate our employees. these demands may require the hiring of additional management personnel and the development of additional expertise by management. any increase in resources devoted to research and product development without a corresponding increase in our operational, financial and management information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.it may be difficult to recruit and retain independent members for our board of directors. the burdens being placed on the members of a board of directors by applicable laws and regulations are making it increasingly difficult to recruit qualified candidates to be members of a board of directors of a public company. these same burdens may make it increasingly difficult to retain members of our board of directors. if we are unable to maintain a board of directors in which our shareholders have confidence, this could have an adverse impact on shareholder confidence and on the price of our stock.if our facilities become inoperable, we will be unable to perform our research and development activities, fulfill the requirements under our collaboration agreement and continue developing products and, as a result, our business will be harmed. we do not have redundant laboratory facilities. we perform substantially all of our research, development and testing in our laboratory located in emeryville, california. emeryville is situated on or near active earthquake fault lines. our facility and the equipment we use to perform our research, development and testing 14 would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. the facility may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development and testing for some period of time. the inability to perform our research and development activities may result in the loss of partners or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those partnerships in the future. our insurance coverage for damage to our property and the disruption of our business may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses, including the loss of time as well as the costs of lost opportunities, and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.obtaining regulatory approval in the united states does not ensure we will obtain regulatory approval in other countries. we will aim to obtain regulatory approval in the united states as well as in other countries. to obtain regulatory approval to market our proposed products outside of the united states, we and any collaborator must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements in other countries regarding safety and efficacy. approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ significantly from that required to obtain fda approval. the regulatory approval process in other countries include all of the risk associated with fda approval as well as additional, presently unanticipated risks. regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects associated with regulatory approval in the united states, including the risk that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. in addition, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in other countries can result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution.if we are unable to design, conduct and complete clinical trials successfully, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our products. in order to obtain fda approval for some of our product candidates, we must submit to the fda a new drug application, or nda, demonstrating that the product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use. this demonstration requires significant research and animal tests, which are referred to as preclinical studies, as well as human tests, which are referred to as clinical trials. any clinical trials we conduct or that are conducted by our partners may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy of our product candidates. success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. results of later clinical trials may not replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. even if the results of one or more of our clinical trials are positive, we may have to commit substantial time and additional resources to conducting further preclinical studies or clinical trials before we can submit ndas or obtain fda approvals for our product candidates, and positive results of a clinical trial may not be replicated in subsequent trials. clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement. the clinical trial process is also time-consuming. furthermore, if participating patients in clinical studies suffer drug-related adverse reactions during the course of such trials, or if we or the fda believe that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, we will have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials. failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat clinical studies. 15 in addition, the completion of clinical trials can be delayed by numerous factors, including: delays in identifying and agreeing on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment; increases in time required to complete monitoring of patients during or after participation in a trial; and unexpected need for additional patient-related data. any of these delays, if significant, could impact the timing, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and could significantly increase our overall costs of drug development. even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, their results may not support our expectations or intended marketing claims. the clinical trials process may fail to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for indicated uses. such failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate for some indications and could delay development of other product candidates.government agencies may establish usage guidelines that directly apply to our proposed products or change legislation or regulations to which we are subject. government usage guidelines typically address matters such as usage and dose, among other factors. application of these guidelines could limit the use of products that we may develop. in addition there can be no assurance that government regulations applicable to our proposed products or the interpretation thereof will not change and thereby prevent the marketing of some or all of our products for a period of time or permanently. the fdas policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the united states or in other countries.our product candidates may be classified as a drug or a medical device, depending on the indication of use and prior precedent, and a change in the classification may have an adverse impact on our revenues or our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. several potential indications for our product candidates may be regulated under the medical device regulations of the fda administered by the center for devices and radiological health or by the center for drug evaluation and research and the same physical product may be regulated by one such agency for one indication and the other agency for another indication. our products may be classified by the fda as a drug or a medical device depending upon the indications for use or claims. for example, for nvc-422, if the indication is for bladder lavage, we believe it would be classified as a medical device, whereas we believe it would be considered a drug when it is indicated for the prevention of urinary tract infection. similarly, the use of nvc-101 as a solution for cleansing and debriding wounds would be considered as a medical device. in addition, the determination as to whether a particular indication is considered a drug or a device is based in part u</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this Prospectus, prospective investors should consider carefully the following factors in evaluating an investment in the Common Shares offered by this Prospectus DEPENDENCE ON AVIATION INDUSTRY The Company's success is largely dependent on continuing demand for the Company's services to passenger airlines. That demand is driven by domestic air travel volume and by the travel volume experienced by, and the financial condition of, the particular air carriers that choose ITS as a service providerAlthough the volume of air travel has grown significantly in the past ten years, the aviation industry historically has been highly cyclical. Because the Company's typical billing arrangements are based on the number of hours of service provided or flights serviced by the Company, a significant industry downturn or financial difficulties experienced by particular airline clients could have a material adverse effect on the volume of services providedAdditionally, the financial condition of particular airline clients can have a material impact on the prices that they are willing to pay for the Company's services. Consolidation in the airline industry also could result in the Company losing contracts. Outsourcing by U.S. airlines of an increasing number of nonflight services has increased the demand for the Company's services, but there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or not be reversed. In addition, the trend by airlines to select a limited number of vendors to provide all or a large part of their predeparture screening and other services may not continue and, if it does continue, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to provide the same volume of services which it currently provides. See "Business -- Aviation Services." DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL The Company's success will depend in part on the continued service of its key employees, including, among others, Robert A. Weitzel, its Chief Executive Officer, James O. Singer, President and Chief Operating Officer, Robert ASwartz, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Scott E. Brewer, Vice President and General Counsel. The loss of one or more of the Company's key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company. As the Company continues to grow, it will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so. See "Management." RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING A GROWING BUSINESS ITS has rapidly expanded its operations in the past several years. This growth has placed demands on its management, administrative, operating and financial resources. The Company's planned continued growth may place a significant strain on the Company's resources and the Company's future success may be dependent on its ability to augment its senior management team with talented people. Several members of the Company's senior management team have assumed their current positions since the beginning of fiscal 1996. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to attract and retain adequate management personnel or be able to implement enhancements to its management systems and adapt those systems to respond to changes in its business. See "Business -- Management and Reporting Systems." RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITION STRATEGY An important element of the Company's growth strategy is the pursuit of acquisitions. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including potentially adverse short-term effects on the Company's reported operating results, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, diversion of management's attention, dependence on retention, hiring and training of key personnel, and risks associated with unanticipated problems or liabilities and amortization of goodwill and an acquired company's intangible assets, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify, acquire, integrate or profitably manage acquisitions without substantial costs, delays or other problems. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquired businesses will achieve or maintain revenue and 6 7 profitability levels that justify the investment therein. In addition, the Company's use of debt to finance its growth has resulted in significant increases in interest expense over the past three years. In light of the Company's debt service obligations, as well as the labor intensive nature of its business, the Company has historically operated with a working capital deficitSee "Business -- Growth Strategy -- Growth Through Acquisitions." POTENTIAL LOSS OF INTEX CONTRACTS The Company acquired substantially all of the contracts and goodwill of Intex in April 1997. Prior to the acquisition, Intex lost a number of contracts to provide cargo and mail services to Delta Airlines. The Company believes that negative publicity relating to an alleged mail theft operation at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, which included certain former Intex employees, may have contributed to the loss of these contracts. Since the date of the acquisition, Intex has lost contracts that generated approximately $2.5 million in annual revenue. The Intex asset purchase agreement provides for a purchase price adjustment based upon a multiple of monthly revenues on the acquired contracts for the period from April 1, 1997 to June 30, 1997. There can be no assurance that additional contracts held by Intex prior to the acquisition and assumed by the Company will not be terminated subsequent to the end of the purchase price adjustment period. The loss of significant additional contracts related to Intex's business could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Pro Forma Financial Data" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS ITS derives a significant portion of its revenues from relatively few clients. In fiscal 1996, Continental Airlines, Inc., United Air Lines, Inc., Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., US Airways, Inc. and Trans World Airlines, Inc. together accounted for approximately 56% of the Company's revenues. During fiscal 1994, 1995 and 1996, the Company's ten largest clients accounted for an aggregate of approximately 80%, 71% and 69%, respectively, of the Company's revenues. The Company's contracts with its clients, consistent with general industry practice, are generally for one to three year terms but are terminable by either party on 30 to 90 days' notice. The Company has provided services to each of its five largest clients during each of the past five years. While the Company believes that relationships with its customers are generally satisfactory, it believes that its relationships with certain major airlines are unsatisfactory. The quality of relationships with particular customers varies from time to time as a result of customer perceptions of the relative quality of the Company's services, the presence or absence of performance problems and changes in personnel at the Company and at its major customers. There can be no assurance that one or more major clients will not terminate, elect to renegotiate or decide not to renew a Company contract or that the Company will not lose the opportunity to provide services at one or more client locationsLOSS OF CONTRACTS Over the past two fiscal years, the Company has lost contracts to provide screening services at a number of major airports, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Minneapolis, Detroit, Boston and Ontario, California, because of customer dissatisfaction with the Company's services at these locations. The Company believes that the factors contributing to the lost contracts varied from location to location, and included problems with responsiveness and the quality of local management, as well as security breaches at several of the Company's predeparture screening checkpoints. The Company continues to provide services including, in some cases, screening services, at each of these locations. Most of the contracts lost by the Company were controlled by two airline customers who together represented approximately 16.7%, 23.7% and 23.2% of the Company's revenues in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The lost contracts contributed $232,000 to pre-tax earnings. The Company recognizes the need to improve its relationships with these customers, and is making efforts to accomplish this objective. These efforts include the addition of a new Chief Operating Officer with established relationships with several major airlines, and efforts to improve the quality of local and district management personnel. The loss of one or more major clients or of significant service sites may have a material adverse effect on the Company. See "Business -- Customers and Contract Terms." 7 8 IMPACT OF NEGATIVE PUBLICITY The Company's business is subject to public scrutiny and, consequently, can be materially affected by negative publicity or negative public reaction with respect to the Company's policies or operations or the actions of its employeesThe Company has experienced negative publicity from time to time, including publicity arising from security breaches at predeparture screening checkpoints in Albany, New York and San Jose, California (as a consequence of which the Company lost several predeparture screening contracts); an incident involving theft by a former employee in Tampa, Florida; and a checkpoint security test failure at an airport in Islip, New York. Future negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial conditionPROBLEMS WITH LOCAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS The nature of the Company's operations requires it to maintain local management systems and controls sufficient to identify and prevent regulatory violations, theft or other illegal activities by employees and billing irregularities at its locations. The Company's large, low-wage workforce and high turnover rates increase the difficulties associated with establishing and maintaining effective management controls at the local level. The Company has experienced control-related problems at various locations involving employees' compliance with regulatory requirements regarding training records and background checks, and involving employee theft. Some of these incidents have had a material adverse effect on customer relationships and have led to the termination of client contracts. For example, the failure of a local manager to conduct proper background checks led to the loss of contracts, which had generated annual revenue of $1.3 million, to provide predeparture screening services at the airport in Ontario, California. Because of the nature of the Company's business, there can be no assurance that control-related problems will not arise in the future. See "Business -- Workforce Management." LIMITED HISTORY OF PROFITABLE OPERATIONS Although ITS had net income of $1.7 million and $1.0 million for fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995, respectively, the Company had net losses of $718,000 and $74,000 for fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively. There can be no assurance that the Company's business strategies will be successful or that the Company will be able to achieve consistent revenue growth or profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The Company may experience significant fluctuations in future operating results as a result of a number of factors, including the costs associated with future acquisitions, the profitability of acquired operations, changes in the regulatory environment, and increased competition in the industries the Company servesCOMPETITION The Company believes that its aviation security, other aviation services and commercial security clients view price as the overriding consideration in vendor selection and retention. Other important considerations include the quality of services provided, the geographic availability of services and the range of services available. The Company competes with outsourcing companies, specialized contract service providers and its clients' and potential clients' internal service staffs. While substantial consolidation is occurring in the predeparture screening market, the markets for other aviation services and commercial security services remain highly fragmented, with limited barriers to entry. Certain of the Company's competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial resources and larger operations than the Company, and may therefore be better situated to take advantage of expansion opportunities arising from industry consolidation trends. The Company expects that the level of competition that it faces will remain high or increase in the future, and there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to compete successfully. See "Business -- Competition and Marketing." EMPLOYEE TURNOVER The Company's business is very labor intensive and is characterized by high rates of personnel turnover, continuous training requirements and periodic shortages of personnel in some markets. During each of the past 8 9 three fiscal years, the Company's employee turnover rate has been approximately 100%. A higher turnover rate among the Company's employees would increase the Company's recruiting and training costs and may adversely affect productivityIf the Company were unable to recruit and retain sufficient personnel, it would be forced to limit its growth or possibly reduce the scope of its operations Because employee turnover is inherent in the nature of its business, ITS allocates significant resources to recruiting potential employees. Each applicant must complete an interview and a written application that includes inquiry concerning prior criminal convictions. In addition, FAA regulations require that each applicant provide proof of citizenship or resident alien status, and each applicant is subject to a five- or ten-year background verification, depending upon the position, and a pre-employment drug screen. For persons with unescorted access to secured areas, a criminal background verification procedure, which is conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is triggered by any 12-month gap in employment history that can not be explained through independent verification. The Company's policy is not to hire applicants whose criminal background checks reveal prior criminal convictions. The Company believes that it operates its business in substantial compliance with applicable FAA regulatory requirements, including those relating to background verification. The Company from time to time must increase its wage rates and employee benefits in order to attract and retain sufficient qualified employees. Because the Company may not always be able to have its clients absorb the attendant additional costs, these increases can adversely affect the Company's financial performance. See "Business -- Workforce Management." FAILURE TO MEET PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS The Company's success will depend on its ability to continue to meet the performance requirements set by its clients and the government agencies that regulate them. The Company is subject to random periodic testing by the Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") with regard to adherence to regulations relating to predeparture screening and passenger profiling, hiring practices (including background checks, drug testing, training and employee file maintenance), baggage handling, aircraft security, and document verificationThe services provided by the Company require it to train and manage effectively low wage workforces with high turnover rates. From time to time, the Company has failed to meet test standards or a client's service expectations at a particular location, and, like its competitors, has had contracts terminated because of customer dissatisfaction with various aspects of its performance. The risk of contract termination as a result of actual or perceived service failures is enhanced by the substantial publicity that, because of public concern over airline security issues, often attends errors in the provision of screening services. Failure to meet test or other performance standards may result in the loss of a contract or service location or the Company's license to perform services, and any such loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business, results of operations and financial conditionSee "Business -- Aviation Services" and "-- Government Regulation." EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS AND CLAIMS EXPOSURE The Company is required to pay unemployment insurance premiums and workers' compensation benefits for its employees in the United States. Any increase in the cost of unemployment insurance or workers' compensation benefits could adversely affect the Company's profitability. The Company is self-insured for the first $250,000 of each workers' compensation claim and the first $200,000 of each liability claim and, accordingly, establishes reserves for future claims and payments. During fiscal 1996, the Company also implemented a medical insurance program covering substantially all of its hourly workers. That program provides medical benefits to eligible employees with minimal employee contribution. The program provides employees with maximum annual benefits of $10,000, for which the Company is self-insured and, accordingly, establishes reserves for future claims and payments. The Company has only recently established this program, and has less experience on which to base its judgments concerning reserve levels than it does with respect to its workers' compensation and liability self-insurance programs. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual workers' compensation, liability or medical insurance claims will not exceed the amount of the Company's reserves. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pass along to its clients any increased costs related to unemployment, workers' compensation and medical claims. See "Business -- Workforce Management." 9 10 GOVERNMENT REGULATION Aviation security matters affecting airports and passenger airlines are subject to regulation by the FAA and foreign governmental agencies. Demand for the Company's predeparture screening, passenger profiling and various other services is significantly affected by applicable regulatory requirements and security directives issued by governmental authorities. Typically, these authorities react to terrorist or other criminal activity, or threats of such activity, in a manner that increases the demand for the Company's aviation security services. That demand can thereafter diminish as the perceived threat diminishes. In addition, there can be no assurance that applicable regulations will not be changed generally in a manner that would affect adversely the demand for the Company's services. In the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, Congress directed the FAA, among other things, to develop and implement certification procedures for providers of predeparture screening services. The FAA has issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, soliciting comment on a number of issues relating to the certification of screening companies, but has not promulgated any proposed rules concerning implementation of the certification directive. The Company is unable to predict the nature and extent of any such regulations or their potential impact on its business. Major U.S. airlines have considered the creation of a nationwide nonprofit security corporation, funded by the airlines, to handle airport security. Any trend toward the relaxation of aviation security measures or a shift in responsibility for aviation security functions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company currently has licenses to operate in several of the major international airports in Western Europe where licenses are required. The loss of or failure to obtain a license to operate in one or more airports is likely to result in the loss of, or the inability to compete for, a major contract. See "Business -- Government Regulation." LIABILITIES FOR CLIENT AND EMPLOYEE ACTIONS AND OTHER CLAIMS Because the Company's employees function in public facilities and in the workplaces of other businesses, the Company is exposed to possible claims by its clients' customers and employees of discrimination, harassment, negligence, and similar claims. The Company is subject to liability for the acts or negligence of its employees while on assignment that cause personal injury or damages and to claims of misuse of client proprietary information or theft of client property. As a provider of security services, the Company faces potential liability for claims that may arise from any terrorist activity occurring in circumstances associated with the Company. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage against such potential liabilities, any such claim against the Company might exceed the amount of such insurance coverage or fall outside the type of activities covered by such insurance. Any of these situations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition. See "Business -- Workforce Management" and "-- Legal Proceedings." FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS The Company experiences quarterly variations in revenues and operating income as a result of various factors, including the timing of commencement of new contracts, changes in its revenue mix, the timing of additional selling, general and administrative expenses incurred to support new business, the seasonality of air travel and the effect of acquisitions. The Company's revenues are typically based on the number of hours of service provided by the Company or the number of flights serviced. Thus, decreases in air travel generally result in lower revenues for the Company. While the effects of seasonality on ITS's business often are obscured by the timing of the addition of new clients and the performance of new services for existing clients, revenues and operating income typically are at their lowest levels in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year. During fiscal 1996, operating income for the first and fourth quarters amounted to $858,000 and $444,000, respectively, or 24.0% and 12.4% of total operating income for the fiscal year. During fiscal 1995, operating income for the first and fourth quarters amounted to $592,000 and $414,000, respectively, or 23.5% and 16.4% of total operating income for the fiscal yearThis reflects lower levels of air travel during these periods and certain additional expenses, such as annual unemployment insurance premiums, that become payable with the commencement of a new calendar year. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Quarterly Results and Seasonality." 10 11 LACK OF CASH DIVIDENDS The Company does not expect to pay any cash dividends on the Common Shares in the foreseeable future. Any cash otherwise available for such dividends will be reinvested in the Company's business. In addition, the Company's ability to pay cash dividends is limited by the terms of its revolving line of credit from its senior lender. See "Dividend Policy." GRANT OF SECURITY INTERESTS The Company has granted security interests in substantially all of its assets to its senior lender under a revolving line of credit. In the event of a default on the secured indebtedness (whether as a result of the failure to comply with a payment or other covenant, a cross-default, or otherwise), the lender could attempt to foreclose on the Company's assets. Any such attempt would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and on the value of the Common SharesCONTROL BY PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER Immediately following the Offering, Robert A. Weitzel will beneficially own approximately 51% of the outstanding Common Shares (approximately 48% if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). As a result, Mr Weitzel will continue to exercise substantial influence over the election of the Board of Directors and over other matters requiring shareholder approval. This concentration of voting power may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. See "Management," "Principal and Selling Shareholders" and "Description of Capital Shares." NO PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET FOR COMMON SHARES; POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF SHARE PRICE Prior to the Offering, there has been no public market for the Common Shares, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop or be sustained after the Offering. The initial public offering price has been determined through negotiations between the Company and the Representatives of the Underwriters based on various considerations and may not be indicative of the price at which the Common Shares will trade after the Offering. See "Underwriting" for a discussion of the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price. The market price of the Common Shares may be volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company's operating results, announcements of new services offered by the Company or its competitors, developments with respect to conditions and trends in the industries served by the Company, governmental regulation, changes in estimates by securities analysts of the Company's future financial performance, general market conditions and other factors. In addition, the stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have adversely affected the market prices of securities of companies for reasons often unrelated to their operating performanceSHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales, or the availability of Common Shares for future sale, by the Company or by its executive officers, directors and current shareholders will have on the market price of the Common Shares prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of Common Shares (including shares issued on the exercise of options), or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Common Shares. The Company and its directors, officers and current shareholders have agreed not to sell, offer for sale, or otherwise dispose of any Common Shares for a period of 180 days from the date of this Prospectus without the prior written consent of McDonald & Company Securities, Inc. Upon expiration of this period, an aggregate of 64,462 Common Shares will be eligible for sale in the public market without restriction. An additional 3,276,180 Common Shares will be eligible for resale by existing shareholders, subject to the volume and manner of sale limitations imposed by Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Company expects to file, within 180 days after the Offering, a registration statement covering the issuance of shares 11 12 underlying share options granted under the Company's Long Term Incentive PlanSee "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." CERTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code prohibits certain transactions, including mergers, sales of assets and similar corporate transactions involving Ohio corporations and holders of 10% or more of their voting shares, unless certain advance approvals are obtained or certain other conditions are metSection 1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code imposes certain advance notice and shareholder approval requirements with respect to voting share acquisitions that cross the 20%, 33 1/3% and 50% of voting shares thresholds. Section 1707.041 of the Ohio Revised Code imposes advance filing and notice requirements with respect to certain tender offers and invitations for tenders for more than 10% of the outstanding common shares of certain Ohio corporations. The Company's Articles of Incorporation authorize the Company's Board of Directors, without action by the shareholders, to specify the terms of and to issue preferred shares of the Company. These restraints, requirements and authorizations, and the substantial percentage of Common Shares that Mr. Weitzel will hold following the Offering, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. See "Description of Capital Shares." IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION At June 30, 1997, the Company had a net tangible book value deficit of $(1.60) per share. Purchasers of Common Shares in the Offering will incur immediate and substantial dilution of $8.03 in the net tangible book value per Common Share, based on the initial public offering price of $11.25 per shareThe net tangible book value deficit before the offering approximated $5.8 million, and the net tangible book value following the offering is expected to approximate $20.1 million. Accordingly, investors will have paid 100% of the Company's total net tangible book value after the offering and will have an ownership interest in the Company, at June 30, 1997, of approximately 41.6%. See "Dilution." FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Prospectus contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements. Those statements appear in a number of places in this Prospectus and include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company, its directors or its officers with respect to: (i) the declaration or payment of dividends; (ii) potential acquisitions by the Company; (iii) the use of the proceeds of the Offering; (iv) the Company's financing plans; and (v) trends affecting the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statement is not a guarantee of future performance and involves risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. The accompanying information contained in this Prospectus, including, without limitation, the information set forth above and the information under the headings "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," identifies important factors that could cause such differences. With respect to any such forward-looking statement that includes a statement of its underlying assumptions or bases, the Company cautions that, while it believes such assumptions or bases to be reasonable and has formed them in good faith, assumed facts or bases almost always vary from actual results, and the differences between assumed facts or bases and actual results can be material depending on the circumstances. When, in any forward-looking statement, the Company, or its management, expresses an expectation or belief as to future results, that expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and is believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the stated expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. 12</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the related notes and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. the occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. in such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. risks related to drug discovery, development and commercialization we are very early in our development efforts, which may not be successful. all of our product candidates are in the preclinical stage of development. we do not anticipate filing an ind for our lead product candidate, cd101 iv, until the second half of 2015. because of the early stage of our development efforts, we are still in the process of determining the clinical development path for our current and future product candidates. as a result, the timing and costs of the regulatory paths we will follow and marketing approvals remain uncertain. our ability to generate product revenue, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our early-stage product candidates. the success of cd101 iv, cd101 topical, and any other product candidates we may develop will depend on many factors, including the following: n successful completion of preclinical studies to enable submissions of inds; n successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; n demonstrating safety and efficacy; n receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; n establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; n obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity for our product candidates and technologies; n launching commercial sales of the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or selectively in collaboration with others; n acceptance of the product candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; n effectively competing with other therapies; n a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following approval; and n enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims. if we do not accomplish one or more of these goals in a timely manner, or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would harm our business.we may not be successful in our efforts to identify, discover, in-license or acquire potential product candidates. our cloudbreak immunotherapy platform and other drug discovery efforts may not be successful in identifying molecules that could be developed as drug therapies. our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. in particular, our research methodology used may not be successful in identifying compounds with sufficient potency or bioavailability to be potential product candidates. in addition, our potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other negative characteristics. research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. we may choose to focus our efforts and resources on potential product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. if we are unable to identify, in-license or acquire suitable compounds for preclinical and clinical development, we will not be able to generate product revenue, which would harm our financial position and adversely impact our stock price. to date, we have not in-licensed any such compounds. if clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates. before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. a failure of one or more clinical trials could occur at any stage of testing. the outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a particular clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results of that trial. moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to multiple interpretations and analyses. many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. for example, the high rate of correlation for clinical efficacy for antifungals and anti-infectives based on preclinical data may not apply for our current or future product candidates, and any of the potential benefits that we anticipate for human clinical use may not be realized. we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including that: n regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; n we may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites; n clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; n the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate; enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, clinical sites may drop out of our clinical trials or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; n our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; n regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks due to serious and unexpected side effects; n the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; n the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could require that we perform more studies than, or evaluate clinical endpoints other than, those that we currently expect; and n the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate. if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may: n be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates; n not obtain marketing approval at all; n obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; n obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings; n be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or n have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval. 12 product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or in receiving marketing approvals. we do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates, could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, any of which may harm our business and results of operations.we may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our cloudbreak immunology platform to build a pipeline of product candidates. a key element of our strategy is to use and expand our cloudbreak immunology platform to build a pipeline of development candidates and progress these through clinical development for the treatment of a wide variety of infectious diseases, including bacterial and viral infections. to date, the only development candidates that we have identified from the platform are antifungals, and they are in very early preclinical testing. even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential development candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. if we do not continue to successfully develop and eventually commercialize products, we will face difficulty in obtaining product revenues in future periods, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our share price.if we experience delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented. we may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the fda or analogous regulatory authorities outside the united states. in addition, some of our competitors may have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that would treat the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors product candidates. patient enrollment is also affected by other factors, including: n severity of the disease under investigation; n availability and efficacy of approved medications for the disease under investigation; n eligibility criteria for the trial in question; n perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study; n efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; n reluctance of physicians to encourage patient participation in clinical trials; n the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and n proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients. our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.if serious adverse effects or unexpected characteristics of our product candidates are identified during development, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some or all of our product candidates. all of our programs are in preclinical development and their risk of failure is high. it is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. if our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. for example, the pharmacokinetic properties, such as a longer half-life, that differentiate cd101iv from other echinocandins could have side effects that we have not anticipated and the consequences of such side effects could be more severe than has been seen with other echinocandins that have shorter half-lives or are dosed at lower concentrations than we expect for cd101iv. additionally, cd101 topical is the first application of an echinocandin anitfungal as a topical treatment and may have side effects related to the method of treatment delivery that are unexpected and different from those of other echinocandin antifungals. further, the treatment advantages that we 13 are predicting for cd101iv, such as lower healthcare costs resulting from an ability to administer cd101iv once-weekly or the predicted ability of cd101iv to be effective against resistant strains of fungal pathogens, may not be realized. in the biotechnology industry, many agents that initially show promise in early stage testing may later be found to cause side effects that prevent further development of the agent. in addition, fungal infections can occur in patients with co-morbidities and weakened immune systems, and there may be adverse events and deaths in our clinical trials that are attributable to factors other than investigational use of our product candidates.we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. we have limited financial resources. as a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.even if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success. if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community for us to achieve commercial success. if our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue to become profitable. the degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: n the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments; n the terms of any approvals and the countries in which approvals are obtained; n limitations or warnings contained in any labeling approved by the fda or other regulatory agency; n our ability to offer any approved products for sale at competitive prices; n convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments; n the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies or dosing regimens; n the willingness of physicians to prescribe these therapies and, in the case of cd101iv, transition to a once-weekly dosing regimen from traditional once-daily dosing; n the strength of marketing and distribution support; n the success of competing products and the marketing efforts of our competitors; n sufficient third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement; and n the prevalence and severity of any side effects.if, in the future, we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or to selectively enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved. we do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. to achieve commercial success for any approved product for which we retain sales and marketing responsibilities, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to other third parties. in the future, we may choose to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to sell some of our product candidates if and when they are approved. there are risks involved both with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and with entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. for example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. if the commercial launch of a product candidate 14 for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. this may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates on our own include: n our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel; n the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or to achieve adequate numbers of prescriptions for any future products; and n unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization. if we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenue or the profitability of these product revenues to us may be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. in addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. we may have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. if we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.we face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do. the development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. we face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. regulatory incentives to develop drugs for treatment of infectious diseases have increased interest and activity in this area and will lead to increased competition for clinical investigators and clinical trial subjects, as well as for future prescriptions, if any of our product candidates are successfully developed and approved. there are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the indications on which we are focusing our product development efforts. some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach and others are based on entirely different approaches. potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. cd101 iv will primarily compete with antifungal classes for the treatment of candidemia, which include polyenes, azoles and echinocandins. the approved branded therapies for this indication include cancidas (caspofungin, marketed by merck& co.), eraxis (anidulafungin, marketed by pfizer, inc.) and mycamine (micafungin, marketed by astellas pharma us, inc.). in addition, there are other generic products approved for candidemia, marketed by companies such as baxter healthcare corporation, mylan inc. and glenmark generics inc., among others. in addition to approved therapies, we expect that cd101 iv will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, including scy-078 (being developed by scynexis, inc.) and isavuconazole (being developed for the treatment of candidemia jointly by astellas pharma and basilea pharmaceutica ltd.). cd101 topical will primarily compete against azole agents (oral, topical and intravaginal), currently used in the treatment of vvc, as well as over-the-counter topical agents used to treat these conditions. the approved prescription therapies for vvc are diflucan (fluconazole) and terazol (terconazole). several over-the-counter topical agents such as monistat (miconazole), gyne-lotrimin (clotrimazole) or gynazole-1 (butoconazole) are also used to treat vvc. in addition to approved therapies, we expect that cd101 topical will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, including vt-1161 (being developed by viamet pharmaceuticals, inc.) and albaconazole (being developed by actavis plc). we intend to develop c001, the first development candidate from our cloudbreak immunotherapy platform, for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. the approved branded therapies for invasive aspergillosis are vfend (voriconazole, 15 marketed by pfizer, inc.) and cresemba (isavuconazole). there are other generic products approved for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis marketed by companies such as sandoz (a novartis company), teva pharmaceutical industries ltd and glenmark generics inc., among others. our competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. our competitors may also obtain marketing approval from the fda or other regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. many of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition, financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. these same competitors may invent technology that competes with our cloudbreak immunotherapy platform. these third parties may compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.even if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, these products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business. the regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. in the united states, new and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. in many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product-licensing approval is granted. in some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial marketing approval is granted. as a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a drug in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay its commercial launch, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenue we are able to generate from the sale of the drug in that country. adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval. our ability to commercialize any product candidates successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health programs, private health insurers and other third-party payors. third-party payors decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. a significant trend in the u.s. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of payment for particular medications. increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient. coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. if coverage and reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. there may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the fda or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states. moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. coverage and reimbursement rates may vary according 16 to the use of the drug and the medical circumstances under which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products or procedures or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the united states. commercial third-party payors often rely upon medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded programs and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize our approved products and our overall financial condition.product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit the commercialization of any product candidates we may develop. we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop after approval. if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: n decreased demand for any product candidates that we may develop; n injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; n withdrawal of clinical trial participants; n significant costs to defend any related litigation; n substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; n loss of revenue; and n the inability to commercialize any products we may develop. although we intend to obtain product liability insurance prior to the initiation of clinical trials, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. we anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage as we continue clinical trials and if we successfully commercialize any products. insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.if we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business. we are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. our operations also produce hazardous waste products. we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. in the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties. although we maintain workers compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees in our workplace, including those resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, chemical, hazardous or radioactive materials. in addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future envir</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our classa common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including the section titled "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our classa common stock. the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. if any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. in that event, the market price of our classa common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our business and our industry the market for our products and platform is new and unproven, may decline or experience limited growth and is dependent in part on developers continuing to adopt our platform and use our products. we were founded in 2008, and have been developing and providing a cloud-based platform that enables developers and organizations to integrate voice, messaging and video communications capabilities into their software applications. this market is relatively new and unproven and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. we believe that our revenue currently constitutes a significant portion of the total revenue in this market, and therefore, we believe that our future success will depend in large part on the growth, if any, of this market. the utilization of apis by developers and organizations to build communications functionality into their applications is still relatively new, and developers and organizations may not recognize the need for, or benefits of, our products and platform. moreover, if they do not recognize the need for and benefits of our products and platform, they may decide to adopt alternative products and services to satisfy some portion of their business needs. in order to grow our business and extend our market position, we intend to focus on educating developers and other potential customers about the benefits of our products and platform, expanding the functionality of our products and bringing new technologies to market to increase market acceptance and use of our platform. our ability to expand the market that our products and platform address depends upon a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with such products and platform. the market for our products and platform could fail to grow significantly or there could be a reduction in demand for our products as a result of a lack of developer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products and services, decreases in spending by current and prospective customers, weakening economic conditions and other causes. if our market does not experience significant growth or demand for our products decreases, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.we have a history of losses and we are uncertain about our future profitability. we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $26.9million, $26.8million, $35.5million and $6.5million in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and the three months ended march31, 2016, respectively. we had an accumulated deficit of $151.9million as of march31, 2016. we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on, among other things: investments in our engineering team, the development of new products, features and functionality and enhancements to our platform; sales and marketing, including expanding our direct sales organization and marketing programs, especially for enterprises and for organizations outside of the united states, and expanding our programs directed at increasing our brand awareness among current and new developers; expansion of our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally; and general administration, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to being a public company. these investments may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business. we also expect that our revenue growth rate will decline over time. accordingly, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to offset our expected cost increases and achieve and sustain profitability. if we fail to achieve and sustain profitability, then our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.we have experienced rapid growth and expect our growth to continue, and if we fail to effectively manage our growth, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. we have experienced substantial growth in our business since inception. for example, our headcount has grown from 386 employees on march31, 2015 to 567 employees on march31, 2016. in addition, we are rapidly expanding our international operations, and we established operations in three new countries between march31, 2015 and march31, 2016. we expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we have also experienced significant growth in the number of customers, usage and amount of data that our platform and associated infrastructure support. this growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our corporate culture, operational infrastructure and management. we believe that our corporate culture has been a critical component of our success. we have invested substantial time and resources in building our team and nurturing our culture. as we expand our business and mature as a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture while managing this growth. any failure to manage our anticipated growth and organizational changes in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our culture could hurt our chance for future success, including our ability to recruit and retain personnel, and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. this, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, in order to successfully manage our rapid growth, our organizational structure has become more complex. in order to manage these increasing complexities, we will need to continue to scale and adapt our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. the expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and management resources before our revenue increases and without any assurances that our revenue will increase. finally, continued growth could strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers. if we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as we grow, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.our quarterly results may fluctuate, and if we fail to meet securities analysts' and investors' expectations, then the trading price of our classa common stock and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our results of operations, including the levels of our revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin and operating expenses, have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future. these fluctuations are a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict and may or may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. if our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, then the trading price of our classa common stock could decline substantially. some of the important factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase revenue from existing customers and attract new customers; fluctuations in the amount of revenue from our variable customer accounts; our ability to attract enterprises and international organizations as customers; our ability to introduce new products and enhance existing products; competition and the actions of our competitors, including pricing changes and the introduction of new products, services and geographies; the number of new employees; changes in network service provider fees that we pay in connection with the delivery of communications on our platform; changes in cloud infrastructure fees that we pay in connection with the operation of our platform; changes in our pricing as a result of our optimization efforts or otherwise; reductions in pricing as a result of negotiations with our larger customers; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force, including our enterprise sales force, which has been a focus of our recent expansion efforts; change in the mix of products that our customers use; change in the revenue mix of u.s. and international products; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business, including investments in our international expansion; significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our products on our platform; the timing of customer payments and any difficulty in collecting accounts receivable from customers; general economic conditions that may adversely affect a prospective customer's ability or willingness to adopt our products, delay a prospective customer's adoption decision, reduce the revenue that we generate from the use of our products or affect customer retention; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; sales tax and other tax determinations by authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; expenses in connection with mergers, acquisitions or other strategic transactions; and fluctuations in stock-based compensation expense. the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing and other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. in addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses is fixed in nature and is based on forecasted revenue trends. accordingly, in the event of a revenue shortfall, we may not be able to mitigate the negative impact on our income (loss) and margins in the short term. if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors or securities analysts, then the trading price of our classa common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. additionally, certain large scale events, such as major elections and sporting events, can significantly impact usage levels on our platform, which could cause fluctuations in our results of operations. we expect that significantly increased usage of all communications platforms, including ours, during certain seasonal and one-time events could impact delivery and quality of our products during those events. we also experienced increased expenses in the second quarter of 2015 due to our developer conference, signal, which we again hosted in the second quarter of 2016 and plan to host annually. such annual and one-time events may cause fluctuations in our results of operations and may impact both our revenue and operating expenses.if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand and increase market awareness of our company and products, then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. we believe that maintaining and enhancing the "twilio" brand identity and increasing market awareness of our company and products, particularly among developers, is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our platform, to strengthen our relationships with our existing customers and to our ability to attract new customers. the successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on our continued marketing efforts, our ability to continue to offer high quality products, our ability to be thought leaders in the cloud communications market and our ability to successfully differentiate our products and platform from competing products and services. our brand promotion and thought leadership activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. in addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our products and competing products and services, which may significantly influence the perception of our products in the marketplace. if these reviews are negative or not as strong as reviews of our competitors' products and services, then our brand may be harmed. from time to time, our customers have complained about our products, such as complaints about our pricing and customer support. if we do not handle customer complaints effectively, then our brand and reputation may suffer, our customers may lose confidence in us and they may reduce or cease their use of our products. in addition, many of our customers post and discuss on social media about internet-based products and services, including our products and platform. our success depends, in part, on our ability to generate positive customer feedback and minimize negative feedback on social media channels where existing and potential customers seek and share information. if actions we take or changes we make to our products or platform upset these customers, then their online commentary could negatively affect our brand and reputation. complaints or negative publicity about us, our products or our platform could materially and adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition. the promotion of our brand also requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that these expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive and as we expand into new markets. to the extent that these activities increase revenue, this revenue still may not be enough to offset the increased expenses we incur. if we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, then our business may not grow, we may see our pricing power reduced relative to competitors and we may lose customers, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.our business depends on customers increasing their use of our products and any loss of customers or decline in their use of our products could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our ability to grow and generate incremental revenue depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with existing customers and to have them increase their usage of our platform. if our customers do not increase their use of our products, then our revenue may decline and our results of operations may be harmed. customers are charged based on the usage of our products. most of our customers do not have long-term contractual financial commitments to us and, therefore, most of our customers may reduce or cease their use of our products at any time without penalty or termination charges. we cannot accurately predict customers' usage levels and the loss of customers or reductions in their usage levels of our products may each have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. reductions in usage from existing customers and the loss of customers could cause our dollar-based net expansion rate to decline in the future if customers are not satisfied with our products, the value proposition of our products or our ability to otherwise meet their needs and expectations. if a significant number of customers cease using, or reduce their usage of our products, then we may be required to spend significantly more on sales and marketing than we currently plan to spend in order to maintain or increase revenue from customers. such additional sales and marketing expenditures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.if we are unable to attract new customers in a cost-effective manner, then our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. in order to grow our business, we must continue to attract new customers in a cost-effective manner. we use a variety of marketing channels to promote our products and platform, such as developer events and evangelism, as well as search engine marketing and optimization. we periodically adjust the mix of our other marketing programs such as regional customer events, email campaigns, billboard advertising and public relations initiatives. if the costs of the marketing channels we use increase dramatically, then we may choose to use alternative and less expensive channels, which may not be as effective as the channels we currently use. as we add to or change the mix of our marketing strategies, we may need to expand into more expensive channels than those we are currently in, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. we will incur marketing expenses before we are able to recognize any revenue that the marketing initiatives may generate, and these expenses may not result in increased revenue or brand awareness. we have made in the past, and may make in the future, significant expenditures and investments in new marketing campaigns, and we cannot assure you that any such investments will lead to the cost-effective acquisition of additional customers. if we are unable to maintain effective marketing programs, then our ability to attract new customers could be materially and adversely affected, our advertising and marketing expenses could increase substantially and our results of operations may suffer.if we do not develop enhancements to our products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing products, increase adoption and usage of our products and introduce new products. the success of any enhancements or new products depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, actual performance quality, market-accepted pricing levels and overall market acceptance. enhancements and new products that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain errors or defects, may have interoperability difficulties with our platform or other products or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. furthermore, our ability to increase the usage of our products depends, in part, on the development of new use cases for our products, which is typically driven by our developer community and may be outside of our control. we also have invested, and may continue to invest, in the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets that expand the products that we can offer our customers. we may make these investments without being certain that they will result in products or enhancements that will be accepted by existing or prospective customers. our ability to generate usage of additional products by our customers may also require increasingly sophisticated and more costly sales efforts and result in a longer sales cycle. if we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products to meet evolving customer requirements, increase adoption and usage of our products, develop new products, or if our efforts to increase the usage of our products are more expensive than we expect, then our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.if we are unable to increase adoption of our products by enterprises, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. historically, we have relied on the adoption of our products by software developers through our self-service model for a significant majority of our revenue, and we currently generate only a small portion of our revenue from enterprise customers. our ability to increase our customer base, especially among enterprises, and achieve broader market acceptance of our products will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively organize, focus and train our sales and marketing personnel. we have limited experience selling to enterprises and only recently established an enterprise-focused sales force. our ability to convince enterprises to adopt our products will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain sales personnel with experience selling to enterprises. we believe that there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our ability to recruit, train and retain a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals, particularly those with experience selling to enterprises. in addition, even if we are successful in hiring qualified sales personnel, new hires require significant training and experience before they achieve full productivity, particularly for sales efforts targeted at enterprises and new territories. our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. because we do not have a long history of targeting our sales efforts at enterprises, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we organize and train our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. as we seek to increase the adoption of our products by enterprises, we expect to incur higher costs and longer sales cycles. in this market segment, the decision to adopt our products may require the approval of multiple technical and business decision makers, including security, compliance, procurement, operations and it. in addition, while enterprise customers may quickly deploy our products on a limited basis, before they will commit to deploying our products at scale, they often require extensive education about our products and significant customer support time, engage in protracted pricing negotiations and seek to secure readily available development resources. in addition, sales cycles for enterprises are inherently more complex and less predictable than the sales through our self-service model, and some enterprise customers may not use our products enough to generate revenue that justifies the cost to obtain such customers. in addition, these complex and resource intensive sales efforts could place additional strain on our limited product and engineering resources. further, enterprises, including some of our customers, may choose to develop their own solutions that do not include our products. they also may demand reductions in pricing as their usage of our products increases, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margin. as a result of our limited experience selling and marketing to enterprises, our efforts to sell to these potential customers may not be successful. if we are unable to increase the revenue that we derive from enterprises, then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.if we are unable to expand our relationships with existing solution partner customers and add new solution partner customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. we believe that the continued growth of our business depends in part upon developing and expanding strategic relationships with solution partner customers. solution partner customers embed our software products in their solutions, such as software applications for contact centers and sales force and marketing automation, and then sell such solutions to other businesses. when potential customers do not have the available developer resources to build their own applications, we refer them to our network of solution partner customers. as part of our growth strategy, we intend to expand our relationships with existing solution partner customers and add new solution partner customers. if we fail to expand our relationships with existing solution partner customers or establish relationships with new solution partner customers, in a timely and cost-effective manner, or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. additionally, even if we are successful at building these relationships but there are problems or issues with integrating our products into the solutions of these customers, our reputation and ability to grow our business may be harmed.we rely upon amazon web services to operate our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of amazon web services would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. we outsource substantially all of our cloud infrastructure to amazon web services, or aws, which hosts our products and platform. customers of our products need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. aws runs its own platform that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions at aws. we have experienced, and expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks. for instance, in september 2015, aws suffered a significant outage that had a widespread impact on the ability of our customers to use several of our products. in addition, if our security, or that of aws, is compromised, our products or platform are unavailable or our users are unable to use our products within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. it may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our platform performance, especially during peak usage times, as our products become more complex and the usage of our products increases. to the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, either through aws or alternative providers of cloud infrastructure, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. in addition, any changes in service levels from aws may adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' requirements. the substantial majority of the services we use from aws are for cloud-based server capacity and, to a lesser extent, storage and other optimization offerings. aws enables us to order and reserve server capacity in varying amounts and sizes distributed across multiple regions. we access aws infrastructure through standard ip connectivity. aws provides us with computing and storage capacity pursuant to an agreement that continues until terminated by either party. aws may terminate the agreement by providing 30days prior written notice, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon notice. although we expect that we could receive similar services from other third parties, if any of our arrangements with aws are terminated, we could experience interruptions on our platform and in our ability to make our products available to customers, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging alternative cloud infrastructure services. any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, cause customers to stop using our products, impair our ability to increase revenue from existing customers, impair our ability to grow our customer base, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.to deliver our products, we rely on network service providers for our network service. we currently interconnect with network service providers around the world to enable the use by our customers of our products over their networks. we expect that we will continue to rely heavily on network service providers for these services going forward. our reliance on network service providers has reduced our operating flexibility, ability to make timely service changes and control quality of service. in addition, the fees that we are charged by network service providers may change daily or weekly, while we do not typically change our customers' pricing as rapidly. furthermore, many of these network service providers do not have long-term committed contracts with us and may terminate their agreements with us without notice or restriction. if a significant portion of our network service providers stop providing us with access to their infrastructure, fail to provide these services to us on a cost-effective basis, cease operations, or otherwise terminate these services, the delay caused by qualifying and switching to other network service providers could be time consuming and costly and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. further, if problems occur with our network service providers, it may cause errors or poor quality communications with our products, and we could encounter difficulty identifying the source of the problem. the occurrence of errors or poor quality communications on our products, whether caused by our platform or a network service provider, may result in the loss of our existing customers or the delay of adoption of our products by potential customers and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.our future success depends in part on our ability to drive the adoption of our products by international customers. in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and the three months ended march31, 2016, we derived 9%, 12%, 14% and 15% of our revenue, respectively, from customer accounts located outside the united states. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our customer base worldwide. while we have been rapidly expanding our sales efforts internationally, our experience in selling our products outside of the united states is limited. furthermore, our developer-first business model may not be successful or have the same traction outside the united states. as a result, our investment in marketing our products to these potential customers may not be successful. if we are unable to increase the revenue that we derive from international customers, then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.we are in the process of expanding our international operations, which exposes us to significant risks. we are continuing to expand our international operations to increase our revenue from customers outside of the united states as part of our growth strategy. between march31, 2015 and march31, 2016, we opened three offices outside of the united states, all of which are primarily focused on selling efforts. we expect, in the future, to open additional foreign offices and hire employees to work at these offices in order to reach new customers and gain access to additional technical talent. operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks in addition to those we already face in the united states. because of our limited experience with international operations as well as developing and managing sales in international markets, our int</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors you should carefully consider the risks below before making an investment decision. the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our operations. our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks relating to our company our business depends on commodity market and general economic conditions. we generate significant revenues from commissions and clearing fees we earn from executing and clearing customer orders, fees for providing commodity risk management consulting services and interest income we earn on cash and invested balances in our customers accounts. these revenue sources are substantially dependent on customer trading volumes, interest rates and related services and activities. the volume of transactions our customers conduct with us, interest rates and demand for our related services and activities are directly affected by domestic and international commodity market and economic conditions that are beyond our control, including: commodity market conditions, such as price levels and volatility, concerns about terrorism and war, the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, availability and cost of funding and capital, credit capacity or perceived creditworthiness of the futures industry in the marketplace, legislative and regulatory changes, and currency values and changes in government monetary policies. declines in the volume of trading in the markets in which we operate generally result in lower revenue from our most profitable segments, which would adversely affect our profitability.our revenue depends on trading volume which depends in large part on commodity prices and commodity price volatility. trading volume is driven largely by the degree of volatilitythe magnitude and frequency of fluctuationsin prices of commodities. higher volatility increases the need to hedge contractual price risk and creates opportunities for arbitrage trading. energy commodities markets historically, and agricultural commodities markets periodically, have experienced significant price volatility. in addition to price volatility, increases in commodity prices lead to increased trading volume. as prices of commodities have risen, especially energy prices, new participants have entered the markets to address their growing risk-management needs or to take advantage of greater trading opportunities. sustained periods of stability in the prices of commodities or generally lower prices could result in lower trading volumes and, potentially, lower revenues. factors that are particularly likely to affect price volatility and price levels of commodities include: supply and demand of commodities; weather conditions affecting certain commodities; national and international economic and political conditions; perceived stability of commodities and financial markets; 8 the level and volatility of interest rates and inflation; and financial strength of market participants. any one or more of these factors may reduce price volatility or price levels in the markets for commodities trading, which in turn could reduce trading activity in those markets. moreover, any reduction in trading activity could reduce liquidity which in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate any decline in the level of trading activity in these markets.decreases in short-term interest rates would negatively impact our profitability. the level of prevailing short-term interest rates affects our profitability because a portion of our revenue is derived from interest earned from the investment of funds deposited with us by our customers. our financial performance generally benefits from rising interest rates. rising interest rates increase the amount of interest income earned from these customer deposits. if short-term interest rates fall, our revenues derived from interest will decline which would negatively impact our profitability. short-term interest rates are highly sensitive to factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. in particular, decreases in the federal funds rate by the board of governors of the federal reserve system usually lead to decreasing interest rates in the u.s., which generally lead to a decrease in short-term interest rates.our customers are concentrated in the agricultural sector and related industries and we are therefore particularly subject to government policies and regulations affecting those industries. we do a substantial amount of business with companies in the agricultural sector and related industries. economic forces, including agricultural commodity, energy and financial markets, as well as government policies and regulations affecting the agricultural sector and related industries could adversely affect our operations and profitability. agricultural production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations. governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops versus other uses of agricultural resources, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded and the volume and types of imports and exports.many of our customers and much of our expected growth are in the energy and related renewable fuels industries and our revenues could decline as a result of adverse developments in these industries. many of our current customers and much of our expected growth are in the energy and related renewable fuels industries. energy prices and energy price volatility are affected by local, regional and global events and conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant energy-related commodity. adverse developments in the energy markets could adversely affect the operations and profitability of our customers in these industries, which could adversely affect demand for our commodity risk management services in this area and our revenues. the renewable fuels industry is a developing industry that involves a high degree of risk. generally, renewable fuel production is profitable as long as energy prices remain at relatively high levels and feed stocks are readily available at acceptable price and volume levels. in addition, government subsidies of the renewable fuel industry and favorable environmental regulations are critical to the industrys profitability at this time. the renewable fuels industry is currently in a period of rapid expansion, and there can be no assurance that such expansion will continue or that such expansion will not result in reduced prices and profit margins in the industry. we enter into long-term supply contracts with renewable fuel producers, which creates potential execution risk in the event of supply shortages and potential credit risk with respect to the obligations of those producers, particularly if the producers become less profitable.strategic transactions and partnerships may not produce the desired results. we believe that strategic transactions and partnerships are an important component of our growth strategy. however, we cannot guarantee that these opportunities will produce the intended results. furthermore, evaluating and participating in 9 these transactions and partnerships may produce a strain on our resources and may limit our ability to pursue other business initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business. each segment of our business is subject to credit risk. over-the-counter (otc) derivative transactions are subject to credit risks, which is the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform its obligations when due. customers and counterparties that owe us money, securities or other assets may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. as a clearing broker, we act on behalf of our customers for all trades consummated on exchanges. accordingly, we are responsible for our customers obligations with respect to these transactions, which exposes us to significant credit risk. a substantial part of our working capital is at risk if customers default on their obligations to us and their account balances and security deposits are insufficient to meet all of their obligations. our grain merchandising business is also subject to credit risk for the failure of counterparties to meet their financial obligations. these counterparties may, in some instances, be in international markets, which may complicate collection efforts. our financial services activities, which primarily relate to financial accommodations to customers used to acquire and carry commodities, expose us to substantial credit risks due to possible defaults or nonperformance of our customers. although we have procedures for reviewing credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties to address present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee including rapid changes in commodity price levels. some of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. that information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. in addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us. we may be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default by our customers and counterparties.we face substantial competition that could negatively impact our revenues and our profitability. the commodity risk management industry and the broader financial services industry are very competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. many of the companies with which we compete are better capitalized than we are and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. our primary competitors include both large, diversified financial institutions and commodity-oriented businesses, smaller firms that focus on specific products or regional markets and independent futures commission merchants (fcms). as a result, we compete with a large number of smaller firms that focus on personalized service, and a smaller number of larger, better capitalized companies that focus less on personalized service but have significant execution capabilities and market presence. some of our competitors offer a wider range of services, have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do. some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities, technologies and customer requirements than we can, and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing activities. if we are not able to compete successfully in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. we have experienced intense price competition in our clearing and execution business in recent years. some competitors may offer clearing and execution services to customers at lower prices than we are offering, which may force us to reduce our prices or to lose market share and revenue. in addition, we focus on developing and 10 marketing complex strategies to our clients that are specifically designed to address their commodity risk management or merchandising needs, or the needs of their customers. as the market adopts these strategies, competitors may have the ability to replicate our services. as a result, the need for our services in relation to these strategies could be significantly reduced.until recently we operated as a member-owned cooperative and have a limited operating history as a business corporation. accordingly, our historical and recent financial and business results may not be representative of what they may be in the future. prior to 2005, we operated as a member-owned cooperative operating for the benefit of our members and our business strategy was focused on providing services to our members at a reasonable cost. since 2005, we have operated our business for the long-term benefit of our stockholders and our business strategy is designed to maximize revenue and profitability. we have a limited operating history as a business corporation on which you can evaluate our management decisions, business strategy and financial results. as a result, our historical financial and business results may not be representative of what they may be in the future. we are subject to risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties associated with changing and implementing our business strategy.future growth could strain our personnel and infrastructure resources. we anticipate a period of significant growth, which we expect to place a strain on our administrative, financial and operational resources. our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to improve existing, and implement additional, operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. we will also be required to identify, hire and train additional risk management consultants as well as administrative staff. we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or implement such controls, systems and procedures in an efficient and timely manner or that they will be adequate to support our future operations. furthermore, we may not be able to identify, hire and train sufficient personnel to accommodate our growth. if we are unable to manage growth effectively, maintain our service or if new personnel are unable to achieve performance levels, our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our existing customers or attract new customers. the success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase our customer base. customers in our market are sensitive to, among other things, the costs of using our services, the quality of the services we offer, the speed and reliability of order execution and the breadth of our service offerings and the products and markets to which we offer access. we may not be able to continue to offer the pricing, service, speed and reliability of order execution or the service, product and market breadth that customers desire. in addition, once our commodity risk management consulting customers have become better educated with regard to sources of commodity risk and the tools available to facilitate the management of this risk and we have provided them with recommended hedging strategies, they may no longer continue paying monthly fees for these services. furthermore, our existing customers, including integrated risk management program (irmp) customers, generally are not obligated to use our services and can switch providers of clearing and execution services or decrease their trading activity conducted through us at any time. as a result, we may fail to retain existing customers or be unable to attract new customers. our failure to maintain or attract customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we rely on relationships with introducing brokers for obtaining some of our customers. the failure to maintain these relationships could adversely affect our business. we have relationships with introducing brokers who assist us in establishing new customer relationships and provide marketing and customer service functions for some of our customers. these introducing brokers receive compensation for introducing customers to us. many of our relationships with introducing brokers are non-exclusive or may be cancelled on relatively short notice. in addition, our introducing brokers have no obligation to provide new customer relationships or minimum levels of transaction volume. our failure to maintain these relationships with these introducing brokers or the failure of these introducing brokers to establish and maintain customer relationships would result in a loss of revenues, which could adversely affect our business. we are dependent on our management team, and the loss of any key member of our team may prevent us from executing our business strategy effectively. our future success depends, in large part, upon our management team who possess extensive knowledge and management skills with respect to commodity risk management. the unexpected loss of services of any of our executive officers could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively or execute our business strategy. although these officers have employment contracts with us, they are generally not required to remain with us for a specified period of time. in addition, we do not maintain key-man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers.competition for risk management consultants could result in our being unable to attract and retain the highly skilled risk management consultants that we need to support our business or we may be required to incur additional expense to do so. we strive to provide high-quality risk management consulting and execution services that allow us to establish and maintain long-term relationships with our clients. our ability to continue to provide these services, maintain these relationships and expand our business depends, in large part, upon our risk management consultants. as a result, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. competition for the services of consultants is intense, especially for people with extensive experience in the specialized markets in which we participate or may seek to enter. if we are unable to hire highly qualified people, we may not be able to enter new markets or develop new products. if we lose one or more of our risk management consultants in a particular market in which we participate, our revenues may decrease and we may lose market share in that particular market. in addition, recruitment and retention of qualified personnel could require us to pay sign-on or guaranteed bonuses or otherwise increase our employee costs. these additional costs could adversely affect our profitability.we operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations. our businesses, and the commodity brokerage industry generally, are subject to extensive regulation at the federal level. these regulations are designed to protect the interests of the public rather than our stockholders. self-regulatory organizations, including the national futures association (the nfa) and the chicago mercantile exchange (the cme) (our designated self-regulatory organization), require compliance with their extensive rules and regulations. the commodity futures trading commission (the cftc) and other federal agencies extensively regulate the u.s. futures and commodities industry. our grain merchandising business is also subject to state regulation of grain dealers and federal regulation by the u.s. department of agriculture and the food and drug administration. some aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation, including: the way we deal with and solicit clients, capital requirements, financial and reporting practices, required record keeping and record retention procedures, the licensing of our operating subsidiaries and our employees, the conduct of directors, officers, employees and affiliates, systems and control requirements, restrictions on marketing, and client identification and anti-money laundering requirements. failure to comply with any of the laws, rules or regulations of any federal, state or self-regulatory authority could result in a fine, injunction, suspension or expulsion from the industry, which could materially and adversely impact us. 12 we and our employees, including our officers, may be subject to censure, fines, suspensions or other sanctions which may have a material and adverse impact on our business. even if any sanction does not materially affect our financial position or results of operations, our reputation could be harmed. the government agencies that regulate us have broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with their rules, regulations and industry standards of practice. the company and its directors, officers and employees may not comply with the rules and regulations of, and may be subject to claims or actions by, these agencies. in addition, because our industry is heavily regulated, regulatory approval may be required prior to expansion of business activities. we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any desired expansion. even if approvals are obtained, they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations. the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical.changes in legislation or regulations may affect our ability to conduct our business or reduce our profitability. the legislative and regulatory environment in which we operate has undergone significant change in the past and may undergo significant change again in the future. the federal government, the cftc, the securities and exchange commission (the sec), the cme, the nfa and other u.s. or foreign governmental authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations. these legislative and regulatory initiatives may affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable. changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may also adversely affect our business.we are subject to a risk of legal proceedings, which may result in significant losses to us that we cannot recover. many aspects of our business subject us to substantial risk of potential liability to customers and to regulatory enforcement proceedings by federal and other regulators. these risks include, among others, potential civil litigation triggered by regulatory investigations, potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade, the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer, that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction. dissatisfied clients can make claims against us, including claims for negligence, fraud, unauthorized trading, failure to supervise, breach of fiduciary duty, employee errors, intentional misconduct, unauthorized transactions by associated persons and failures in the processing of transactions. these risks also include potential liability from disputes over the exercise of our rights with respect to customer accounts and collateral. although our customer agreements generally provide that we may exercise such rights with respect to customer accounts and collateral as we deem reasonably necessary for our protection, our exercise of these rights could lead to claims by customers that we have exercised these rights improperly. additionally, employee misconduct could subject us to financial losses and regulatory sanctions and could seriously harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions taken to prevent and detect employee misconduct may not always be effective. misconduct by employees could include engaging in unauthorized transactions or activities, failure to properly supervise other employees, engaging in improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improperly using confidential information. we cannot assure you that these types of proceedings will not materially and adversely affect us. employee errors, including mistakes in executing, recording or reporting transactions for clients, could cause us to enter into transactions that clients may disavow and refuse to settle, which could expose us to the risk of material losses until the errors are detected and the transactions are unwound or reversed. if our clients are not able to settle their transactions on a timely basis, the time in which employee errors are detected may be increased and our risk of material loss can be increased. the risk of employee error or miscommunication may be greater for products that are new or have non-standardized terms. 13 misconduct by employees of our customers in dealing with us can also expose us to claims for financial losses or regulatory proceedings when it is alleged we or our employees knew or should have known that the employee of the customer was not authorized to undertake certain transactions. in addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability, the defense of litigation includes increased costs associated with attorneys fees. the amount of outside attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations for any reporting period.our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective, which could increase the risk that we are subject to regulatory action or litigation or otherwise negatively impact our business. our ability to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. if we fail to effectively establish and maintain such compliance and reporting systems or fail to attract and retain personnel who are capable of designing and operating such systems, it will increase the likelihood that we will become subject to legal and regulatory infractions, including civil litigation and investigations by regulatory agencies. for us to avoid a number of risks inherent in our business, it is necessary for us to have policies and procedures that identify, monitor and manage our risk exposure. management of operational, legal and regulatory risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events. such policies may not be fully effective. some of our risk management policies and procedures depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. that information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. further, our risk management policies and procedures rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision, which are subject to error and failure. some of our risk management policies and procedures are based on internally developed controls and observed historical market behavior and also involve reliance on industry standard practices. these policies and procedures may not adequately prevent future losses, particularly as they relate to extreme market movements, which may be significantly greater than comparable historical movements. we may not always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed. if our risk management efforts are ineffective, we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.we operate as a principal in the otc derivatives markets which involves the risks associated with commodity derivative instruments. we offer otc derivatives to our customers in which we act as a principal counterparty. we endeavor to simultaneously offset the commodity price risk of the instruments by establishing corresponding offsetting positions with commodity counterparties. to the extent that we are unable to simultaneously offset an open position or the offsetting transaction is not fully effective to eliminate the commodity derivative risk, we have market risk exposure on these unmatched transactions. our exposure varies based on the size of the overall positions, the terms and liquidity of the instruments brokered, and the amount of time the positions remain open. to the extent an unhedged position is not disposed of intra-day, adverse movements in the commodities underlying these positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss. in addition, any principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period. transactions involving otc derivative contracts may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the level, volatility, correlation or relationship between market prices, rates, indices and/or other factors. these types of instruments may also suffer from illiquidity in the market or in a related market. otc derivative transactions are subject to unique risks. otc derivative transactions are subject to the risk that, as a result of mismatches or delays in the timing of cash flows due from or to counterparties in otc derivative transactions or related hedging, trading, collateral or other transactions, we or our counterparty may not have adequate cash available to fund its current obligations. we could incur material losses pursuant to otc derivative transactions because of inadequacies in or failures of our internal systems and controls for monitoring and quantifying the risk and contractual obligations associated with otc derivative transactions and related transactions or for detecting human error, systems failure or management failure. otc derivative transactions may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms. accordingly it may not be possible to modify, terminate or offset obligations or exposure to the risk associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date.we are subject to regulatory capital requirements and failure to comply with these rules would significantly harm our business. the cftc and various other self-regulatory organizations have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by our fcm subsidiary. failure to maintain the required net capital may subject a firm to limitations on its activities, including suspension or revocation of its registration by the cftc and suspension or expulsion by the nfa, various exchanges of which our fcm subsidiary is a member and ultimately may require its liquidation. failure to comply with the net capital rules could have material and adverse consequences such as limiting our operations, or restricting us from withdrawing capital from our fcm subsidiary. if these net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited. also, our ability to withdraw capital from our regulated subsidiaries is subject to restrictions, which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends, repay debt and redeem or purchase shares of our common stock. a large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing.we are

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus, before making an investment decision. if any of the following risks is realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. in that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our businesswe are an early-stage company with a history of losses, and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability. we have incurred net losses since our inception. for the years ended december31, 2011 and 2012 and for the six months ended june30, 2013, we had a net loss of $14.4million, $18.6million and $13.4million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses this year and in future years. as of june30, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of $73.5million. to date, we have generated only limited revenue, and we may never achieve revenue sufficient to offset our expenses. over the next several years, we expect to continue to devote substantially all of our resources to increase adoption of, and reimbursement for, afirma and to develop future diagnostic solutions. we may never achieve or sustain profitability, and our failure to achieve and sustain profitability in the future could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.our financial results depend solely on sales of afirma, and we will need to generate sufficient revenue from this and other diagnostic solutions to grow our business. all of our historical revenue has been derived from the sale of afirma, which we commercially launched in january 2011. for the foreseeable future, we expect to derive substantially all of our revenue from sales of afirma. we are in various stages of research and development for other diagnostic solutions that we may offer, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify other diseases that can be effectively addressed with our molecular cytology platform or, if we are able to identify such diseases, whether or when we will be able to successfully commercialize these solutions. if we are unable to increase sales of afirma, expand reimbursement for afirma, or successfully develop and commercialize other solutions, our revenue and our ability to achieve and sustain profitability would be impaired, and the market price of our common stock could decline.we depend on medicare, aetna and unitedhealthcare for a significant portion of our revenue and if one or more significant payers stop providing reimbursement or decrease the amount of reimbursement for our tests, our revenue could decline. reimbursement on behalf of patients covered by medicare accounted for 34% and 35% of our revenue for the year ended december31, 2012 and for the six months ended june30, 2013, respectively. unitedhealthcare accounted for 12% and 14% of our revenue for the year ended december31, 2012 and for the six months ended june30, 2013, respectively. aetna accounted for 13% and 7% of our revenue for the year ended december31, 2012 and for the six months ended june30, 2013, respectively. effective january2012, palmetto gba, the regional medicare administrative contractor, or mac, that handled claims processing for medicare services with jurisdiction at that time, issued coverage and payment determinations on the gec. on a five-year rotational basis, medicare requests bids for its regional mac services. in mid-september 2013, noridian administrative services is scheduled to succeed palmetto as the mac for our region. the change in the mac processing medicare claims for the gec could result in a change in the coverage or reimbursement rates for the gec, or the loss of coverage. the transition to noridian could also result in delays in payments made to us on behalf of medicare patients. we do not have a contracted rate of reimbursement with aetna, humana or unitedhealthcare. payers may suspend or discontinue reimbursement at any time, may require or increase co-payments from patients, or may reduce the reimbursement rates paid to us. any such actions could have a negative effect on our revenue.if payers do not provide reimbursement, rescind or modify their reimbursement policies or delay payments for our tests, or if we are unable to successfully negotiate reimbursement contracts, our commercial success could be compromised. physicians may not order our tests unless payers reimburse a substantial portion of the test price. there is significant uncertainty concerning third-party reimbursement of any test incorporating new technology, including the gec. reimbursement by a payer may depend on a number of factors, including a payer's determination that tests such as the gec are: not experimental or investigational; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed publications; and included in clinical practice guidelines. since each payer makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to reimburse our test, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. we do not have a contracted rate of reimbursement with most payers. without a contracted rate for reimbursement, our claims are often denied upon submission, and we must appeal the claims. the appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may not result in payment. in cases where there is not a contracted rate for reimbursement, there is typically a greater co-insurance or co-payment requirement which may result in further delay or decreased likelihood of collection. we expect to continue to focus substantial resources on increasing adoption of and coverage and reimbursement for afirma. we believe it may take several years to achieve coverage and contracted reimbursement with a majority of third-party payers. however, we cannot predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payers will reimburse for our test. if we fail to establish broad adoption of and reimbursement for our products, or if we are unable to maintain existing reimbursement from payers, our ability to generate revenue could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer.we may experience limits on our revenue if physicians decide not to order afirma. if we are unable to create or maintain demand for afirma in sufficient volume, we may not become profitable. to generate demand, we will need to continue to educate physicians about the benefits and cost-effectiveness of afirma through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education by our sales force. in addition, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers will be critical to generating revenue. several existing guidelines and historical practices in the united states regarding indeterminate thyroid nodule fna results recommend a full or partial surgical thyroidectomy in most cases. accordingly, physicians may be reluctant to order a diagnostic solution that may suggest surgery is unnecessary where several current guidelines and historical practice have typically led to such procedures. moreover, our diagnostic services are performed at our clinical reference laboratory rather than by a pathologist in a local laboratory, so pathologists may be reluctant to support our services. in addition, guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid nodules may subsequently be revised to recommend another type of treatment protocol, and these changes may result in medical practitioners deciding not to use afirma. these facts may make physicians reluctant to convert to using afirma, which could limit our ability to generate revenue and our ability to achieve profitability. to the extent international markets have existing practices and standards of care that are different than those in the united states, we may face challenges with the adoption of afirma outside the united states.the success of our relationship with genzyme to co-promote afirma may have a significant effect on our business. we sell afirma in the united states through our internal sales team and through our co-promotion agreement with genzyme corporation. we are also working with genzyme to begin selling afirma in certain countries outside of the united states. under the agreement, we are required to pay genzyme a co-promotion fee that is equal to a percentage of our cash receipts from afirma. the percentage is currently 40% and will decrease to 32% in march 2014 and thereafter. our agreement with genzyme expires in 2027 and either party may terminate the agreement at any time without cause and with six months prior notice. if we were to terminate the agreement without cause prior to january 2014, we would be required to repay 50% of the $10.0million fee we received from genzyme. such percentage would be reduced to 40% of such fee if we were to terminate the agreement between january 2014 and january 2015, and 30% of such fee if we were to terminate the agreement between january 2015 and january 2016. we have also granted genzyme a right of first offer to co-promote any future thyroid cancer product that we commercialize. if genzyme does not commit the necessary resources to market and sell afirma to the level of our expectations, or if they terminate the agreement, we may not realize the benefits of this relationship, and our ability to generate revenue in the future may be harmed. if our agreement with genzyme were terminated, we would have to hire additional sales personnel to support the growth of afirma and any other thyroid product we agree to co-promote with genzyme. any such termination may also delay our entry into international markets.because we do not recognize a significant portion of our revenue on an accrual basis, our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate. we currently recognize the majority of our revenue upon the earlier of receipt of third-party payer notification of payment or when cash is received. we have little visibility as to when we will receive payment for our diagnostic test, and we must appeal negative payment decisions, which delays collections. these factors will likely result in fluctuations in our quarterly revenue. as a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. in addition, these fluctuations in revenue may make it difficult for us, research analysts and investors to accurately forecast our revenue and operating results. if our revenue or operating results fall below expectations, the price of our common stock would likely decline.we rely on sole suppliers for some of the reagents, equipment, chips and other materials used in afirma, and we may not be able to find replacements or transition to alternative suppliers. we rely on sole suppliers, such as nugen technologies,inc. and affymetrix,inc., for critical supply of reagents, equipment, chips and other materials that we use to perform the gec. we also purchase components used in our afirma collection kits from sole-source suppliers. some of these items are unique to these suppliers and vendors. in addition, we utilize a sole source to assemble and distribute our sample collection kits. while we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or the alternative sources will be available when we need them. if these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform the gec and for our collection kits, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, an interruption in test processing could occur. any such interruption may significantly affect our future revenue and harm our customer relations and reputation. in addition, in order to mitigate these risks, we may need to maintain inventories of these supplies at higher levels than would be the case if multiple sources of supply were available.we depend on a specialized cytopathology practice to perform the cytopathology component of afirma, and our ability to perform our diagnostic solution would be harmed if we were required to secure a replacement. we rely on thyroid cytology partners, p.a., or tcp, to provide cytopathology professional diagnoses on thyroid fna samples pursuant to a pathology services agreement. pursuant to this agreement, tcp has the exclusive right to provide the cytopathology diagnoses on fna samples at a fixed price per test. we have also agreed to allow tcp to co-locate in a portion of our facilities in austin, texas. our agreement with tcp is effective until december 2015 and thereafter automatically renews every year unless either party provides notice of intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the then-current term. if tcp were not able to support our current test volume or future increases in test volume or to provide the quality of services we require, or if we are unable to agree on commercial terms and our relationship with tcp were to terminate, our business would be harmed until we are able to secure the services of another cytopathology provider. there can be no assurance that we would be successful in finding a replacement that would be able to conduct cytopathology diagnoses at the same volume or with the same high-quality results as tcp. locating another suitable cytopathology provider could be time consuming and would result in delays in processing tests until a replacement was fully integrated with our test processing operations.if we are unable to support demand for afirma or any of our future products or solutions, our business could suffer. as demand for afirma or any of our future products or solutions grows, we will need to continue to scale our testing capacity and processing technology, expand customer service, billing and systems processes and enhance our internal quality assurance program. we will also need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific and technical personnel to process higher volumes of our tests. we cannot assure you that any increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance will be successfully implemented or that appropriate personnel will be available. failure to implement necessary procedures, transition to new processes or hire the necessary personnel could result in higher costs of processing tests or inability to meet demand. there can be no assurance that we will be able to perform our testing on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand, or that our efforts to scale our operations will not negatively affect the quality of test results. if we encounter difficulty meeting market demand or quality standards, our reputation could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer.if the fda were to begin regulating our tests, we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain premarket clearance or approval. clinical laboratory tests like afirma are regulated under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988, or clia, as well as by applicable state laws. most laboratory developed tests, or ldts, are not currently subject to fda regulation, although reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform ldts may be subject to regulation. although the fda has never defined what qualifies as an ldt, we believe that afirma is an ldt. as a result, we believe afirma should not be subject to regulation in accordance with the fda's current policy of exercising enforcement discretion regarding ldts. from time to time, the fda has indicated that it was revisiting its current policy of enforcement discretion and planned to issue guidance that, when finalized, would adopt a risk-based framework that would increase fda oversight of ldts. in july 2010, the fda convened a public meeting to discuss such a risk-based framework. legislative proposals addressing oversight of ldts were introduced in the previous two congresses and we expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time. we cannot provide any assurance that fda regulation, including premarket review, will not be required in the future for our tests, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the fda, new enforcement policies adopted by the fda or new legislation enacted by congress. it is possible that legislation will be enacted into law, regulations could be promulgated or guidance could be issued by the fda which may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to continue to offer our tests or to develop and introduce new tests. we cannot predict the timing or content of future legislation enacted, regulations promulgated or guidance issued regarding ldts, or how it will affect our business. if fda premarket review, including approval, is required for afirma or any of our future tests we may develop, or we decide to voluntarily pursue fda approval, we may be forced to stop selling our tests or we may be allowed to keep selling our tests while we work to obtain fda approval. our business would be negatively affected until such review is completed and clearance to market or approval is obtained. the regulatory process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical studies and submitting premarket notification or filing a premarket approval application with the fda. if premarket review is required by the fda or if we decide to voluntarily pursue fda premarket review of our tests, there can be no assurance that afirma or any tests we may develop in the future will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, nor can there be assurance that labeling claims will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our tests. if our tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty in the marketplace about our tests, if we are required by the fda to label them investigational, or if labeling claims the fda allows us to make are limited, orders may decline and reimbursement may be adversely affected. ongoing compliance with fda regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to heightened regulation by the fda and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. some of the materials we use for afirma are labeled for research use only. in june 2011, the fda issued draft guidance regarding "commercially distributed in vitro diagnostic products labeled for research use only or investigational use only". to date, the fda has not issued final research-use only guidance. we cannot predict the ultimate timing or form of any such guidance or regulation and or the potential effect on afirma, our tests in development or the materials used to perform our tests. while we qualify all materials used in our tests according to clia regulations, we cannot be certain that the fda would not promulgate rules or issue guidance documents that could affect our ability to purchase materials necessary for the performance of our tests. should any of the reagents, instruments, software or components obtained by us from suppliers and used in conducting our tests be affected by future regulatory actions, our business could be adversely affected by those actions, including increasing the cost of testing or delaying, limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents, instruments, software or components necessary to perform testing. in addition, our sample collection container is classified as a classi medical device and is listed with the fda. if the fda was to determine that it is a classii medical device, we would be required to file a 510(k)application and obtain fda clearance to use the container, which could be time consuming and expensive.we may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy. in addition to the need to scale our testing capacity, future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. in addition, rapid and significant growth may place strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. our ability to manage our business and growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. we have only recently installed a new, internally developed data warehouse, which is critical to our ability to track our diagnostic services and patient reports delivered to physicians, as well as to support our financial reporting systems. the time and resources required to optimize these systems is uncertain, and failure to complete optimization in a timely and efficient manner could adversely affect our operations. if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our business could be harmed.billing for our diagnostic solution is complex, and we must dedicate substantial time and resources to the billing process to be paid for our tests. billing for clinical laboratory testing services is complex, time consuming and expensive. depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, including medicare, insurance companies and patients, all of which have different billing requirements. we generally bill third-party payers for our diagnostic solution and pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis where pricing contracts are not in place. to the extent laws or contracts require us to bill patient co-payments or co-insurance, we must also comply with these requirements. we may also face increased risk in our collection efforts, including potential write-offs of doubtful accounts and long collection cycles, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. several factors make the billing process complex, including: differences between the list price for afirma and the reimbursement rates of payers; compliance with complex federal and state regulations related to billing medicare; disputes among payers as to which party is responsible for payment; differences in coverage among payers and the effect of patient co-payments or co-insurance; differences in information and billing requirements among payers; incorrect or missing billing information; and the resources required to manage the billing and claims appeals process. additionally, our billing activities require us to implement compliance procedures and oversight, train and monitor our employees, challenge coverage and payment denials, assist patients in appealing claims, and undertake internal audits to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures. payers also conduct external audits to evaluate payments, which add further complexity to the billing process. these billing complexities, and the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our diagnostic solution, could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow, our ability to achieve profitability, and the consistency and comparability of our results of operations.we rely on a third party to transmit claims to payers, and any delay in transmitting claims could have an adverse effect on our revenue. while we manage the overall processing of claims, we rely on a third-party provider to transmit the actual claims to payers based on the specific payer billing format. we have previously experienced delays in claims processing when our third-party provider made changes to its invoicing system, and again when it did not submit claims to payers within the timeframe we require. if claims for afirma are not submitted to payers on a timely basis, or if we are required to switch to a different provider to handle claim submissions, we may experience delays in our ability to process these claims and receipt of payments from payers, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue and our business.international expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the united states. our business strategy includes international expansion, primarily through our co-promotion agreement with genzyme, and may include establishing and maintaining physician outreach and education capabilities outside of the united states and expanding our relationships with international payers. doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including: multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, privacy laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses; failure by us to obtain regulatory approvals where required for the use of our solution in various countries; complexities associated with managing multiple payer reimbursement regimes, government payers or patient self-pay systems; logistics and regulations associated with shipping tissue samples, including infrastructure conditions and transportation delays; limits on our ability to penetrate international markets if we are not able to process tests locally; financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the effect of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our solution and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over activities that may fall within the purview of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, its books and records provisions or its anti-bribery provisions. any of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our revenue and results of operations.if we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve profitability. our principal competition for afirma comes from traditional methods used by physicians to diagnose thyroid cancer. practice guidelines in the united states have historically recommended that patients with indeterminate diagnoses from cytopathology results be considered for surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid to rule out cancer. this practice has been the standard of care in the united states for many years, and we need to educate physicians about the benefits of afirma to change clinical practice. we also face competition from commercial laboratories, such as laboratory corporation of america holdings and quest diagnostics incorporated, with strong infrastructure to support the commercialization of diagnostic services. we face potential competition from companies such as life technologies corporation, which is currently expected to be acquired by thermo fisher scientificinc., and illumina,inc., both of which have recently announced their intention to enter the clinical diagnostics market. other potential competitors include companies that develop diagnostic products, such as roche diagnostics, a division of roche holdingltd, siemens ag and qiagen n.v. we also face competition from asuragen inc. and other companies that measure mutational markers such as braf and kras to identify nodules that are malignant instead of benign. in the future, we may also face competition from companies developing new products or technologies. in addition, competitors may develop their own versions of our solution in countries where we do not have patents or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging the use of their solution by physicians in other countries. to compete successfully we must be able to demonstrate, among other things, that our diagnostic test results are accurate and cost effective, and we must secure a meaningful level of reimbursement for our products. many of our potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities than we do. others may develop products with prices lower than ours that could be viewed by physicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our solution, or offer solutions at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the list price of our solution and affect our ability to achieve profitability. if we are unable to change clinical practice in a meaningful way or compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our products, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.developing new products involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be able to commercialize on a timely basis, or at all, other products we are developing. we have enhancements to our current afirma offering and other diagnostic solutions under development that will require us to devote considerable resources to research and development. there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify other diseases that can be effectively addressed with our molecular cytology platform. in addition, if we identify such diseases, we may not be able to develop products with the diagnostic accuracy necessary to be clinically useful and commercially successful. we are in the process of developing the afirma malignant gec and a product for interstitial lung disease. these products may not be fully developed and introduced as planned in 2014 and 2016, respectively. in the longer term, we may face challenges obtaining sufficient numbers of samples to validate a genomic signature for a molecular diagnostic product. in order to develop and commercialize diagnostic products, we need to: expend significant funds to conduct substantial research and development; conduct successful analytical and clinical studies; scale our laboratory processes to accommodate new tests; and build the commercial infrastructure to market and sell new products. our product development process involves a high degree of risk and may take several years. our product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including: failure to identify a genomic signature in biomarker discovery; inability to secure sufficient numbers of samples to conduct analytical and clinical studies; or failure of clinical validation studies to support the effectiveness of the test. typically, few research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical studies often is not replicated in later studies. at any point, we may abandon development of a product candidate or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical studies, which would adversely affect the timing for generating potential revenue from a new product and our ability to invest in other products in our pipeline. if a clinical validation study fails to demonstrate the prospectively defined endpoints of the study or if we fail to sufficiently demonstrate analytical validity, we might choose to abandon the development of the product, which could harm our business. in addition, competitors may develop and commercialize competing products or technologies faster than us or at a lower cost. we may acquire businesses or assets, form joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders' ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense. as part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets, as well as technology licensing arrangements. we also may pursue strategic alliances that leverage our core technology and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution, or make investments in other companies. to date</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors risks related to our financial condition and capital requirements we have incurred significant losses since our inception, anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability. we are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. for the last several years, we have focused our efforts primarily on developing i.v. cr845 with the goal of achieving regulatory approval. since inception, we have incurred significant operating and net losses. our net losses were $9.8 million and $6.3 million for the years ended december31, 2011 and december 31, 2012, respectively. as of september30, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of $60.4 million. although we recognized $11.0 million of revenue during the nine months ended september 30, 2013 pursuant to our collaboration agreement with maruishi pharmaceutical co., ltd., or maruishi, we nevertheless generated a net loss of $1.9 million for the period, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating and net losses over the next several years, as we continue to develop i.v. cr845 and our other product candidates. in addition, we expect to incur significant sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses related to the commercialization of i.v. cr845 or our other product candidates, if they are approved by the fda. as a result, we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we: commence our planned phase 3 and other trials for i.v. cr845; initiate and enroll our phase 1 clinical trials of oral cr845; discover and develop additional product candidates; conduct late-stage clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete early clinical trials; increase our i.v. cr845 manufacturing batch sizes to satisfy fda requirements for phase 3 clinical trials and a new drug application, or nda, submission; establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval and that we choose not to license to a third party; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; and add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts. to become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. this will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, discovering additional product candidates, potentially entering into collaboration and license agreements, obtaining regulatory approval for product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. we are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. we may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never achieve profitability. because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. if we are required by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase. even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. a decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment. our short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. we commenced operations in 2004, and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and developing our product candidates, including undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials of our lead product candidate, i.v. cr845. we have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, a product candidate. in addition, as a relatively nascent business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown difficulties. if our product candidates are approved by the fda, we will need to expand our capabilities to support commercial activities. we may not be successful in adding such capabilities. consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.we will need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts. conducting clinical trials, pursuing regulatory approvals, establishing outsourced manufacturing relationships and successfully manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates, including i.v. cr845, is expensive. we will need to raise additional capital to: fund our future clinical trials if we encounter any unforeseen delays or difficulties in our planned development activities for i.v. cr845; fund our operations and continue our efforts to hire additional personnel and build a commercial infrastructure to prepare for the commercialization of i.v. cr845 and our other future product candidates, if approved by the fda; qualify and outsource the commercial-scale manufacturing of our products under current good manufacturing practices, or cgmp; advance oral cr845 beyond phase 2 clinical trials; develop additional product candidates, including cr701; and in-license other product candidates. we believe that with our available cash and cash equivalent balance as of september30, 2013, along with the net proceeds from this offering, we will have sufficient funds to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 24 months, without giving effect to any potential milestone payments we may receive under our collaboration agreements. we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could spend our available financial resources faster than we currently expect. further, we may not have sufficient financial resources to meet all of our objectives if i.v. cr845 is approved, which could require us to postpone, scale back or eliminate some, or all, of these objectives, including our potential launch activities relating to i.v. cr845. our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: the potential for delays in our efforts to seek regulatory approval for i.v. cr845, and any costs associated with such delays; the costs of establishing a commercial organization to sell, market and distribute i.v. cr845; the rate of progress and costs related to our phase 1 and phase 2 development of oral cr845; the rate of progress and costs of our efforts to prepare for the submission of an nda for any product candidates that we may in-license or acquire in the future, and the potential that we may need to conduct additional clinical trials to support applications for regulatory approval; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our product candidates, including any such costs we may be required to expend if our licensors are unwilling or unable to do so; the cost and timing of manufacturing sufficient supplies of i.v. cr845 in preparation for commercialization; the effect of competing technological and market developments; the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish; defending our intellectual property and patent rights; and the success of the commercialization of i.v. cr845 and our other product candidates. 11 future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies. until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, product supply revenue and royalties, corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements, as well as through interest income earned on cash and investment balances. we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate, one or more of our development programs or our commercialization efforts. risks related to our business and the development of our product candidateswe are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, i.v. cr845, and cannot guarantee that this product candidate will successfully complete phase 3 clinical trials, receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized. we currently have no products approved for commercial distribution. we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our most advanced product candidate, i.v. cr845. our business depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates, and in particular, i.v. cr845, which may never occur. our ability to generate revenues in the near term is substantially dependent on our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize i.v. cr845. we currently generate no revenues from sales of any products, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product. our lead product candidate, i.v. cr845, will require additional clinical development, regulatory approval, commercial manufacturing arrangements, establishment of a commercial organization, significant marketing efforts and further investment before we generate any revenues from product sales. we are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates, including i.v. cr845, before we receive regulatory approval from the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. if we do not receive fda approval for, and successfully commercialize, i.v. cr845, we will not be able to generate revenue from i.v. cr845 in the united states in the foreseeable future, or at all. any significant delays in obtaining approval for and commercializing i.v. cr845 will have a substantial adverse impact on our business and financial condition. we have not previously submitted an nda to the fda, or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that i.v. cr845 or any of our other product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. even though i.v. cr845 has completed three phase 2 clinical trials, it is, nonetheless, susceptible to the risks of failure inherent at any stage of product development, including the appearance of unexpected adverse events or failure to achieve its primary endpoints in subsequent clinical trials, including our planned phase 3 clinical trials. further, our product candidates, including i.v. cr845, may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. if approved for marketing by applicable regulatory authorities, our ability to generate revenues from i.v. cr845 will depend on our ability to: create market demand for i.v. cr845 through our own marketing and sales activities, and any other arrangements to promote this product candidate we may otherwise establish; hire, train and deploy a sales force to commercialize i.v. cr845 in the united states; manufacture i.v. cr845 in sufficient quantities and at acceptable quality and manufacturing cost to meet commercial demand at launch and thereafter; establish and maintain agreements with wholesalers, distributors and group purchasing organizations on commercially reasonable terms; create partnerships with, or offer licenses to, third parties to promote and sell i.v. cr845 in foreign markets where we receive marketing approval; maintain patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for i.v. cr845; launch commercial sales of i.v. cr845, whether alone or in collaboration with others; achieve market acceptance of i.v. cr845 by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; 12 achieve appropriate reimbursement for i.v. cr845; effectively compete with other therapies; and maintain a continued acceptable safety profile of i.v. cr845 following launch. as we continue to develop our other product candidates, including oral cr845 and cr701, we expect to face similar risks to our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize such product candidates as we face with i.v. cr845.our lead product candidate, i.v. cr845, and our second product candidate, oral cr845, act as selective kappa opioid receptor agonists, which is a drug class that has not previously yielded a successful commercial product for pain indications. the development of product candidates based on peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonists is an emerging field, and the scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop product candidates that work through this mechanism are relatively recent. the scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing differentiated product candidates based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. we believe that we are amongst a relatively small group of companies that are pursuing the development of product candidates based on peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonists. in addition, we believe that companies that previously explored the development of kappa opioid receptor agonists abandoned these efforts because those prior generation kappa agonists, which were centrally active, resulted in psychiatric side effects. although cr845 is a peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonist and these side effects have not been observed in any of our clinical trials to date, it is possible that we could observe similar side effects, or other unacceptable adverse events. as a result, our approach to developing product candidates based on peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonists may not be successful and may never lead to marketable products.we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on developing product candidates for specific indications that we identify as most likely to succeed, in terms of both its regulatory approval and commercialization. as such, we are currently primarily focused on the development of i.v. cr845 for acute postoperative pain. as a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that may prove to have greater commercial potential. our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.if we fail to supply cr845 to our collaboration partners we could lose revenues and be in breach of our obligations. in connection with our agreements with maruishi pharmaceutical co., ltd, or maruishi, and chong kun dang pharmaceutical corp., or ckd, we are obligated to negotiate in good faith to enter into supply agreements, pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions, we have obligations to supply cr845 to these parties for commercialization. at this time, our suppliers for i.v. cr845 include polypeptide laboratories, or polypeptide, for the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and patheon uk limited, for manufacturing of the finished clinical trial material. under the terms of our agreement with polypeptide, it has agreed to manufacture and supply to us quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient according to mutually agreed upon specifications for clinical trial purposes. in addition, under the terms of our agreement with patheon, we have agreed to supply patheon with sufficient quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient, which it in turn manufactures into clinical trial material for use in our clinical trials. if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of cr845 product from third-party suppliers to meet our obligations to maruishi and/or ckd, we will be in breach of our supply obligations under the agreements, and may be liable for damages, which could also 13 hurt our business and reputation. in addition, our failure to supply our partners with cr845 will inhibit their ability to commercialize cr845 products, which, in turn will result in a loss of revenue for us.our future growth may depend on our ability to identify and develop products and if we do not successfully identify and develop product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities. a component of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by developing products that we believe are a strategic fit with our focus on pain therapeutics. however, these business activities may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including: difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such development; disruption of our business and diversion of our managements time and attention; higher than expected development costs; exposure to unknown liabilities; difficulty in managing multiple product development programs; and inability to successfully develop new products or clinical failure. we have limited resources to identify and execute the development of products. moreover, we may devote resources to potential development that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. if we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates, we may not be able to obtain product revenues in future periods.the regulatory approval processes of the fda and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. if we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates as expected, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. the time required to obtain approval by the fda and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. in addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidates clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. we have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates, including i.v. cr845 and oral cr845, or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future, will ever obtain regulatory approval. our product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory agencies in the united states and by the european medicines agency and similar regulatory authorities outside the united states. failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. we have no experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party cros and consultants to assist us in this process. securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidates safety and efficacy for that indication. securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. a number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. our future clinical trial results may not be successful. we may 14 also experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including: regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites; clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; changes in marketing approval policies during the development period; changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations; changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application; the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials. moreover, if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may: be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates; not obtain marketing approval at all; obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings; be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval. furthermore, regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. in addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. finally, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. any of these scenarios could compromise the commercial prospects for our product candidates to assure safe use of the product candidates, either as a condition of product candidate approval or on the basis of new safety information. 15 if we experience delays in obtaining approval, if we fail to obtain approval of a product candidate or if the label for a product candidate does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate, the commercial prospects for such product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.the fda may determine that i.v. cr845 or any of our other product candidates have undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization. undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the fda or other comparable foreign authorities. for example, if concerns are raised regarding the safety of a new drug as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical testing, the fda may order us to cease further development, decline to approve the drug or issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the drug. the number of such requests for additional data or information issued by the fda in recent years has increased, and resulted in substantial delays in the approval of several new drugs. undesirable side effects caused by i.v. cr845 or any of our other product candidates could also result in denial of regulatory approval by the fda or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or the inclusion of unfavorable information in our product labeling, and in turn prevent us from commercializing and generating revenues from the sale of i.v. cr845 or any other product candidate. to date, the side effects observed in the completed i.v. cr845 clinical trials include dizziness, transient facial tingling, a state of near-sleep, or somnolence, and hypernatremia, an electrolyte disturbance that is defined by an elevated sodium level in the blood, which we believe is secondary, at least in part, to another side effect, aquaresis, that is defined as electrolyte-free urination. prolonged aquaresis can result in a negative fluid balance if the excreted water is not replaced by oral or intravenous water, and although we will recommend such prevention of dehydration, we cannot be certain that such instructions will be followed by healthcare providers and/or patients, and failure to follow such instructions may be accompanied by adverse events associated with dehydration, including disability and death. we believe that one such adverse event, which has been observed, postural tachycardia, an elevation of heart rate upon standing up, is a physiological reflex that can be triggered as a result of decreased intravascular volume caused by a negative fluid balance. we have observed transient prolactin elevations, which are brief increases in the concentration of the hormone prolactin in the bloodstream, in response to i.v. cr845, which we have measured as a nonselective opioid biomarker since both kappa and mu opioids elicit this effect. we cannot be certain that such elevations in prolactin will be transient, safe, and well tolerated in all patients. in addition, kappa opioid agonists, the class of drugs that i.v. cr845 belongs to, have been associated with poorly tolerated psychiatric side effects, such as a feeling of emotional and mental discomfort, or dysphoria, and hallucinations, at high doses, particularly for prior generations of kappa opioid agonists with substantially unrestricted or only partially restricted entry to the cns. although we have not observed psychiatric side effects in any cr845 clinical trials to date, we cannot be certain that these side effects or others will not be observed in the future, or that the fda will not require additional trials or impose more severe labeling restrictions due to these side effects or other concerns. the drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. additionally if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product; regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label; we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, if not already required pursuant to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or rems; we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and our reputation may suffer. 16 any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.if we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented. we may not be able to initiate or continue conducting clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the fda or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states. some of our</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, before buying shares of our common stock. Any of the risk factors we describe below could severely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events. You may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. Some of the statements in "Risk Factors" are forward-looking statements. See "Forward-Looking Statements." IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT QUALIFIED NURSES AND OTHER ALLIED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS FOR OUR HEALTHCARE STAFFING BUSINESS AT REASONABLE COSTS, IT COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSWe rely significantly on our ability to attract and retain nurses and other allied healthcare professionals who possess the skills, experience and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of our hospital and healthcare facility clients. We compete for healthcare staffing personnel with other temporary healthcare staffing companies and with hospitals and healthcare facilities. We must continually evaluate and expand our temporary healthcare professional network to keep pace with our hospital and healthcare facility clients' needs. Currently, there is a shortage of qualified nurses in most areas of the United States, competition for nursing personnel is increasing, and salaries and benefits have risen. We may be unable to continue to increase the number of temporary healthcare professionals that we recruit, decreasing the potential for growth of our business. Our ability to attract and retain temporary healthcare professionals depends on several factors, including our ability to provide temporary healthcare professionals with assignments that they view as attractive and to provide them with competitive benefits and wages. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in any of these areas. The cost of attracting temporary healthcare professionals and providing them with attractive benefit packages may be higher than we anticipate and, as a result, if we are unable to pass these costs on to our hospital and healthcare facility clients, our profitability could decline. Moreover, if we are unable to attract and retain temporary healthcare professionals, the quality of our services to our hospital and healthcare facility clients may decline and, as a result, we could lose clients. WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET AND OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN OBTAINING AND RETAINING HOSPITAL AND HEALTHCARE FACILITY CLIENTS AND TEMPORARY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALSThe temporary healthcare staffing business is highly competitive. We compete in national, regional and local markets with full-service staffing companies and with specialized temporary staffing agencies. Some of our competitors in the temporary nurse staffing sector include Cross Country, InteliStaf, Medical Staffing Network and RehabCare Group. Some of these companies may have greater marketing and financial resources than us. We believe that the primary competitive factors in obtaining and retaining hospital and healthcare facility clients are identifying qualified healthcare professionals for specific job requirements, providing qualified employees in a timely manner, pricing services competitively and effectively monitoring employees' job performance. We compete for temporary healthcare professionals based on the quantity, diversity and quality of assignments offered, compensation packages and the benefits that we provide. Competition for hospital and healthcare facility clients and temporary healthcare professionals may increase in the future and, as a result, we may not be able to remain competitive. To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices or increasing marketing expenditures, we could lose revenues or hospital and healthcare facility clients and our margins could decline, which could seriously harm our operating results and cause the price of our stock to decline. In addition, the development of alternative recruitment channels could lead our hospital and healthcare facility clients to bypass our services, which would also cause our revenues and margins to decline. 7 OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO SECURE AND FILL NEW ORDERS FROM OUR HOSPITAL AND HEALTHCARE FACILITY CLIENTS BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS OR EXCLUSIVE CONTRACTS WITH THEMWe do not have long-term agreements or exclusive guaranteed order contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to continually secure new orders from hospitals and other healthcare facilities and to fill those orders with our temporary healthcare professionals. Our hospital and healthcare facility clients are free to place orders with our competitors and choose to use temporary healthcare professionals that our competitors offer them. Therefore, we must maintain positive relationships with our hospital and healthcare facility clients. If we fail to maintain positive relationships with our hospital and healthcare facility clients, we may be unable to generate new temporary healthcare professional orders and our business may be adversely affected. FLUCTUATIONS IN PATIENT OCCUPANCY AT THE HOSPITAL AND HEALTHCARE FACILITIES OF OUR CLIENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND THEREFORE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSDemand for our temporary healthcare staffing services is significantly affected by the general level of patient occupancy at our hospital and healthcare clients' facilities. When occupancy increases, temporary employees are often added before full-time employees are hired. As occupancy decreases, hospital and healthcare facility clients typically will reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees. In addition, we may experience more competitive pricing pressure during periods of occupancy downturn. Occupancy at our healthcare clients' facilities also fluctuates due to the seasonality of some elective procedures. We are unable to predict the level of patient occupancy at any particular time and its effect on our revenues and earnings. HEALTHCARE REFORM COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REVENUES AND MARGINSThe U.S. government has undertaken efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation, regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and drug companies. In the recent past, the U.S. Congress has considered several comprehensive healthcare reform proposals. The proposals were generally intended to expand healthcare coverage for the uninsured and reduce the growth of total healthcare expenditures. While the U.S. Congress did not adopt any comprehensive reform proposals, members of Congress may raise similar proposals in the future. If any of these proposals are approved, hospitals and other healthcare facilities may react by spending less on healthcare staffing, including nurses. If this were to occur, we would have fewer business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our businessState governments have also attempted to control the growth of healthcare costs. For example, the state of Massachusetts has recently implemented a regulation that limits the hourly rate paid to temporary nursing agencies for registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and certified nurses aides. While the current regulation does not apply to us, if similar regulations were to be applied to longer term contracts in states in which we operate, our revenues and margins could decreaseFurthermore, third party payors, such as health maintenance organizations, increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical care. Failure by hospitals and other healthcare facilities to obtain full reimbursement from those third party payors could reduce the demand or the price paid for our services. WE OPERATE IN A REGULATED INDUSTRY AND CHANGES IN REGULATIONS OR VIOLATIONS OF REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS OR SANCTIONS THAT COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITYThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations related to professional licensure, conduct of operations, payment for services and payment for referrals. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations that are directly applicable to our business, we could suffer civil and/or criminal penalties or be subject to injunctions or cease and desist ordersOur business is generally not subject to the extensive and complex laws that apply to our hospital and healthcare facility clients, including laws related to Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. However, these laws and regulations could indirectly affect the demand or the prices paid for our 8 services. For example, our hospital and healthcare facility clients could suffer civil and/or criminal penalties and/or be excluded from participating in Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare programs if they fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to their businesses. In addition, our hospital and healthcare facility clients could receive reduced reimbursements, or be excluded from coverage, because of a change in the rates or conditions set by federal or state governments. In turn, violations of or changes to these laws and regulations that adversely affect our hospital and healthcare facility clients could also adversely affect the prices that these clients are willing or able to pay for our services. SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIESIn recent years, our hospital and healthcare facility clients have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice or related legal theories. Because our temporary healthcare professionals provide medical care, claims may be brought against our temporary healthcare professionals and us relating to the quality of medical care provided by our temporary healthcare professionals while on assignment at our hospital and healthcare facility clients. We and our temporary healthcare professionals are at times named in these lawsuits regardless of our contractual obligations or the standard of care provided by our temporary healthcare professionals. In some instances, we are required to indemnify hospital and healthcare facility clients contractually against some or all of these potential legal actions. Also, because most of our temporary healthcare professionals are our employees, we may be subject to various employment claims and contractual disputes regarding the terms of a temporary healthcare professional's employment. We maintain a policy of $10 million for employment practices coverage with an additional excess coverage of $10 million. We also have two layers of professional and general liability coverage. The professional and general liability coverage consists of primary coverage with limits of $1 million per occurrence and $3 million in the aggregate and an umbrella policy with limits of $20 million. However, our insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. Also, we may not be able to pass on all or any portion of increased insurance costs to our hospital and healthcare facility clients. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or if any claims are not covered by insurance, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities. WE MAY BE LEGALLY LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM OUR HOSPITAL AND HEALTHCARE FACILITY CLIENTS' MISTREATMENT OF OUR TRAVELING HEALTHCARE PERSONNELBecause we are in the business of placing our temporary healthcare professionals in the workplaces of other companies, we are subject to possible claims by our temporary healthcare professionals alleging discrimination, sexual harassment, negligence and other similar activities by our hospital and healthcare facility clients. The cost of defending such claims, even if groundless, could be substantial and the associated negative publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified individuals in the future. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE INTEGRATION OF OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONSDuring the last year, we acquired two companies in the temporary healthcare staffing industry: Preferred Healthcare Staffing and O'Grady-Peyton International. These acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies, the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies and the diversion of management attention from existing operations. We may not be able to fully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our own in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In addition, through our most recent acquisition, O'Grady-Peyton International, we are now involved in new international temporary healthcare professional recruitment markets where we have limited or no experience. Our failure to effectively integrate either of these businesses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 9 DIFFICULTIES IN MAINTAINING OUR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS THAT REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITYOur ability to deliver our staffing services to our hospital and healthcare facility clients and manage our internal systems depends to a large extent upon the performance of our management information and communications systems. If these systems do not adequately support our operations, or if we are required to incur significant additional costs to maintain or expand these systems, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. OUR OPERATIONS MAY DETERIORATE IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT, DEVELOP AND RETAIN OUR SALES PERSONNELOur success is dependent upon the performance of our sales personnel, especially regional client service directors, hospital account managers and recruiters. The number of individuals who meet our qualifications for these positions is limited and we may experience difficulty in attracting qualified candidates. In addition, we commit substantial resources to the training, development and support of these individuals. Competition for qualified sales personnel in the line of business in which we operate is strong and there is a risk that we may not be able to retain our sales personnel after we have expended the time and expense to recruit and train them. THE LOSS OF KEY SENIOR MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVEWe believe that the success of our business strategy and our ability to operate profitably depends on the continued employment of our senior management team, led by Steven Francis, Susan Nowakowski and Donald Myll. Other than Steven Francis, none of our senior management team has an employment contract with us. If Steven Francis or other members of our senior management team become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY CRISIS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSOur corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California. Southern California has been and is expected to continue to be subject to periodic power outages. Interruption of power may cause our computer systems, phone lines and other communications systems to become inoperable for unknown periods of time. Our inability to successfully conduct our temporary healthcare professional recruiting efforts and other back-office functions from our headquarters location due to power outages in California could have an adverse effect on our operations. OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS WILL CONTINUE TO CONTROL US AFTER THIS OFFERING, AND THEY MAY MAKE DECISIONS WITH WHICH YOU DISAGREEUpon consummation of this offering, HWH Capital Partners, L.P. and some of its affiliates, whom we refer to collectively as the "HWP stockholders," will own approximately 64.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or 62.5% if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. As a result, the HWP stockholders will be able to control us and direct our affairs, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership also may delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of our company, and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. These transactions might include proxy contests, tender offers, mergers or other purchases of common stock that could give you the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for shares of our common stock. 10 WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. OUR LEVEL OF GOODWILL MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF DECREASING OUR EARNINGS OR INCREASING OUR LOSSESAs of September 30, 2001, we had $125.9 million of unamortized goodwill on our balance sheet, which represents the excess of the total purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired. At September 30, 2001, goodwill represented 49% of our total assets Currently, we amortize goodwill on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of future benefit of 25 years. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 requires that, subsequent to January 1, 2002, goodwill not be amortized but rather that it be reviewed annually for impairment. In the event impairment is identified, a charge to earnings would be recorded. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 141 immediately and SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. Although it does not affect our cash flow, amortization of goodwill or an impairment charge to earnings has the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses, as the case may be. If we are required to amortize a substantial amount of goodwill or take a charge to earnings, our stock price could be adversely affected. WE WILL INCUR CHARGES AGAINST OUR FUTURE EARNINGS IN THE QUARTER IN WHICH THIS OFFERING IS CONSUMMATEDUpon consummation of this offering, options to purchase 5,181,642 shares of our common stock that we granted to members of our management will be vested. These options have an average exercise price $12.45 below the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share. As a result, we expect to record a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $18.7 million in the quarter in which this offering is consummated. In addition, upon consummation of this offering, we will take a charge against earnings of approximately $5.2 million, net of income tax benefits, related to the write-off of unamortized discount on the senior subordinated notes and unamortized deferred financing costs resulting from the early extinguishment of our existing indebtedness, the termination of our existing interest rate swap agreements, and a prepayment premium resulting from the early extinguishment of the senior subordinated notes. YOU WILL INCUR IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION OF THE BOOK VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCKThe initial public offering price of our common stock is substantially greater than the book value per share of our common stock. As a result, if you purchase our common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate dilution. This means that you will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds the per share book value of our assets immediately following this offering after subtracting our liabilities. In addition, all of the purchasers in this offering will have contributed 57.5% of the total consideration received for our common stock but collectively will own only 24.5% of our outstanding shares. The exercise of outstanding options with an exercise price less than the initial public offering price of this offering and the issuance of common stock with a purchase price less than the initial public offering price of this offering will each result in further dilution to you. See "Dilution." 11 OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE AND YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO RESELL YOUR SHARES AT OR ABOVE THE OFFERING PRICEPrior to this offering, there has not been a public market for our common stock. We cannot predict whether a liquid trading market will develop. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiations between us and the representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations as a result of many factors, including those listed in this "Risk Factors" section of the prospectusIn recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of specific companies. Our market price may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including: - our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies; - news announcements relating to us, our industry or our competitors; - changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts; - changes in general economic conditions; - the number of shares to be publicly traded after this offering; - actions of our current stockholders; and - other developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors. A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR SHARES ARE OR WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE WHICH COULD DEPRESS OUR STOCK PRICESales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that a large number of shares will be sold, could depress the market price of our common stock. After this offering, our current stockholders will own beneficially approximately 75.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or approximately 72.8% if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. After expiration of a 180-day "lock-up" period to which all of our current stockholders, directors, executive officers and option holders are subject, these holders will be entitled to dispose of their shares, although the shares of common stock held by our affiliates will continue to be subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, Banc of America Securities LLC may, in its sole discretion and at any time without notice, release all or any portion of the shares subject to the lock-upAfter this offering, the holders of approximately 33,293,322 shares of our common stock (including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options) will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares, these holders could cause the price of our common stock to decline. 12</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS Before you invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the various risks, including those described below, together with all of the other information included in this prospectus. Risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could cause our sales revenues to decreaseOur sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we were to lose one or more of these customers, or if one or more of these customers were to delay or reduce purchases of our products, our sales revenues may decrease. For the six months ended June 30, 1999, approximately 81% of our revenues were generated by five of our customers, and revenues derived from sales to Talent Trade Asia, TriGem and Silicon Application Corporation accounted for 42%, 20% and 10%, respectively, of our product sales. For the year ended December 31, 1998, approximately 60% of our revenues were generated by five of our customers, and revenues derived from sales to Silicon Application Corporation, BTC, Askey Computer and Zoltrix accounted for 15%, 13%, 12% and 12%, respectively, of our product sales. These customers may in the future decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns, because: . we do not have any long-term purchase arrangements or contracts with these or any of our other customers, . our product sales to date have been made primarily on a purchase order basis, which permit our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice and without penalty, and . many of our customers also have pre-existing relationships with current or potential competitors which may affect our customers' purchasing decisionsWe expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next 12 to 18 months and that a significant portion of our sales will continue to be made on the basis of purchase orders. We have significant sales and operations concentrated in Asia. Continued political and economic instability in Asia and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase market demand for our productsOur sales to customers located in Asia accounted for 74%, 77% and 76% of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively, and 77% and 99% of total revenues in the six months ended June 30, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The predominance of our sales are in Asia, mostly in Taiwan and China, because our customers are primarily motherboard or modem manufacturers that are located there. In many cases, our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers specify that our products be included on the modem boards or motherboards, the main printed circuit board containing the central processing unit of a computer system, that they purchase from board manufacturers, and we sell our products directly to the board manufacturers for resale to our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers. Industry statistics indicate that approximately two thirds of modems manufactured in Asia are sold back to original equipment manufacturers located in the United States. Due to the industry-wide concentration of modem manufacturers in Asia, we believe 7 that a high percentage of our future sales will continue to be concentrated with Asian customers. As a result, our future operating results could be uniquely affected by a variety of factors outside of our control, including: . political and economic instability, such as the recent political instability in Indonesia and the economic turmoil in Japan, . changes in tariffs, quotas, import restrictions and other trade barriers which may make our products more expensive compared to our competitors, . delays in collecting accounts receivable, which we have experienced from time to time, and . fluctuations in the value of Asian currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which may make it more costly for us to do business in Asia which may in turn make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our revenuesTo successfully expand our sales in Asia and internationally, we must strengthen foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international distributors and resellers. This will require significant management attention and financial resources. To the extent that we are unable to effect these additions in a timely manner, we may not be able to maintain or increase market demand for our products in Asia and internationally, and our operating results could be hurt. The recent earthquake in Taiwan and subsequent aftershocks may cause our revenues or profitability to decreaseBecause our products are sold to motherboard or modem manufacturer customers in Taiwan, the recent earthquake in Taiwan may result in less demand for our products and may cause our revenues to decrease. Our customers who are outside of Taiwan may also be dependent on other components manufactured in Taiwan. The recent earthquake may disrupt the operations of our customers' other suppliers who are located in Taiwan, and may result in a decrease in demand of our products. We are also dependent on our suppliers who manufacture product components in Taiwan. The recent earthquake may disrupt the operations of these suppliers. If they are not able to adequately supply us, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products. We do not currently believe that the effect of this earthquake on our business will be material. However, due to the nature of this disaster and the fact that its full impact on our business has not been fully evaluated, our sales to customers in Asia may be affected in the next few quarters. Continuing decreases in the average selling prices of our products could result in decreased revenuesProduct sales in the connectivity industry have been characterized by continuing erosion of average selling prices. Price erosion experienced by any company can cause revenues and gross margins to decline. The average selling price of our products has decreased by approximately 40% from October 1995 to June 30, 1999. We expect this trend to continueIn addition, we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards in the soft modem industry is likely to further erode average selling prices, particularly for analog modems. Adoption of industry standards is driven by the market requirement to have interoperable modems. End users need this interoperability to ensure modems from different manufacturers communicate with each other without problems. Historically, users have deferred purchasing modems until these industry standards are adopted. However, once these standards are accepted, it lowers the barriers to entry and price erosion has resulted. Decreasing average selling prices in our products could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units that we sell increases. Therefore, we must continue to develop and introduce next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins. Our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margin to decline. Our gross margins may vary based on the mix of sales of our products and services, and these variations may hurt our net incomeWe derive a significant portion of our sales from our software-based connectivity products. We expect margins on newly introduced products generally to be higher than our existing products. However, due in part to 8 the competitive pricing pressures that affect our products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs, we expect margins from both existing and future products to decrease over time. In addition, licensing revenues from our products historically have provided higher margins than of our product sales. Changes in the mix of products sold and the percentage of our sales in any quarter attributable to products as compared to licensing revenues will cause our quarterly results to vary and could result in a decrease in net income. Our revenues may fluctuate each quarter due to both domestic and international seasonal trendsWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in sales of our connectivity products. These seasonal trends materially affect our quarter-to-quarter operating results. Our revenues are higher during the back- to-school and holiday seasons which fall in the third and fourth calendar quarters. Revenue in our third and fourth quarters are typically higher relative to other quarters because many purchasers of PCs make purchase decisions based on their calendar year-end budgeting requirements. As a result, we generally expect revenue levels for the first quarter to be less than those for the preceding quarterWe are currently expanding our sales in international markets, particularly in Asia, Europe and South America. We expect our third quarter to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity and spending activity generally associated with that time of year, particularly in Europe. To the extent that our revenues in Asia, Europe or other parts of the world increase in future periods, we expect our period-to-period revenues to reflect seasonal buying patterns in these markets. Any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in customers cancelling purchases of our productsSales cycles for our products with major customers are lengthy, often lasting six months or longer. In addition, it can take an additional six months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products. Sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons: . our original equipment manufacturer customers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products, over which we have no control, before placing a purchase order, . the commercial integration of our products by an original equipment manufacturer is typically limited during the initial release to evaluate product performance, and . the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayedA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders. The lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases. If customer cancellations or product changes were to occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses. We expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future and these increased expenses may diminish our ability to remain profitableAlthough we have been profitable in recent years, we may not remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially over at least the next three years as we: . further develop and introduce new applications and functionality for our host signal processing technology, . explore emerging product opportunities in digital technologies and wireless and cable communications, . expand our distribution channels, both domestically and in our international markets, and . pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions. 9 In order to maintain profitability we will be required to increase our revenues to meet these additional expenses. Any failure to significantly increase our revenues as we implement our product, service, distribution and strategic relationship strategies would result in a decrease in our overall revenuesTo date, we have principally relied upon our distributor sales organization for product sales to smaller accounts. Our direct sales efforts have focused principally on board manufacturers and smaller PC original equipment manufacturers. To increase penetration of our target customer base, including large, tier-one original equipment manufacturers, we must significantly increase the size of our direct sales force and organize and deploy sales teams targeted at specific domestic tier-one original equipment manufacturer accounts. If we are unable to expand our sales to additional original equipment manufacturers, our revenues may not meet analysts' expectations which could cause our stock price to drop. We must accurately forecast our customer demand for our modem products. If there is an unexpected fluctuation in demand for our products, we may incur excessive operating costs or lose product revenuesWe must forecast and place purchase orders for specialized semiconductor chips, the application specific integrated circuit, coder/decoder and discrete access array, or data access arrangement, components of our modem products, several months before we receive purchase orders from our own customers. This forecasting and order lead time requirement limits our ability to react to unexpected fluctuations in demand for our products. These fluctuations can be unexpected and may cause us to have excess inventory, or a shortage, of a particular product. In the event that our forecasts are inaccurate, we may need to write down excess inventory. For example, we were required to write down inventory in the second quarter of 1996 in connection with a product transition within our 14.4 Kbps product family. Similarly, if we fail to purchase sufficient supplies on a timely basis, we may incur additional rush charges or we may lose product revenues if we are not able to meet a purchase order. These failures could also adversely affect our customer relations. Significant write- downs of excess inventory or declines in inventory value in the future could cause our net income and gross margin to decrease. We rely heavily on our intellectual property rights which offer only limited protection against potential infringers. Unauthorized use of our technology may result in development of products that compete with our products which could cause our market share and our revenues to be reducedOur success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. These means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate. We hold a total of 32 patents, a number of which cover technology that is considered essential for International Telecommunications Union standard communications solutions, and also have 26 additional patent applications pending or filed. These patents may never be issued. These patents, both issued and pending, may not provide sufficiently broad protection against third party infringement lawsuits or they may not prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Other than the Motorola and ESS lawsuits described elsewhere in this prospectus, to date, no material lawsuits relating to intellectual property have been filed against usDespite precautions that we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may provide our licensees with access to our proprietary information underlying our licensed applications. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology. Finally, policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and some foreign laws, including those of various countries in Asia, do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as United States laws. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resourcesWe have received, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. These claims could affect our relationships with existing customers and may prevent potential future customers from purchasing our products or licensing our 10 technology. Because we depend upon a limited number of products, any claims of this kind, whether they are with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In the event that we do not prevail in litigation, we could be prevented from selling our products or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms which may not be acceptable to us. We could also be prevented from selling our products or be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Should we cross license our intellectual property in order to obtain licenses, we may no longer be able to offer a unique productNew patent applications may be currently pending or filed in the future by third parties covering technology that we use currently or may use in the future. Pending U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents are issued, and thus it is impossible to ascertain all possible patent infringement claims against us. We believe that several of our competitors, including Motorola, Lucent and ESS Technology, may have a strategy of protecting their market share by filing intellectual property claims against their competitors and may assert claims against us in the future. The legal and other expenses and diversion of resources associated with any such litigation could result in a decrease in our revenuesIn addition, some of our customer agreements include an indemnity clause that obligates us to defend and pay all damages and costs finally awarded by a court should third parties assert patent and/or copyright claims against our customers. As a result, we may be held responsible for infringement claims asserted against our customers. If our financial reserves for potential future license fees are less than any actual fees that we are required to pay, our net income would be reducedWe have established and recorded on a monthly basis a financial per-unit reserve for payment of future license fees based upon our estimate as to the likely amount of the licensing fees that we may be required to pay in the event that licenses are obtained. We believe that it is typical for participants in the modem industry to obtain licenses in exchange for grants of cross licenses rather than for payment of fees and we have based our estimates on our understanding of the license fee practices of other segments of our industry. Our reserves may not be adequate because of factors outside of our control and because these license fee practices in the modern industry may not be applicable to our experience. Competition in the connectivity market is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for, or the prices of, our products may be reducedThe connectivity device market is intensely competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors. Our current competitors include 3Com, Conexant, ESS Technology, Lucent Technologies and Motorola. Motorola introduced soft modems in the third quarter of 1998 and Conexant introduced soft modems in the fourth quarter of 1998. We expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors enhance their product offerings, new suppliers enter the connectivity device market, new communication technologies are introduced and additional networks are deployedWe may in the future also face competition from other suppliers of products based on host signal processing technology or on new or emerging communication technologies, which may render our existing or future products obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. We believe that these competitors may include Alcatel, Analog Devices, Aware, Broadcom, Com21, Efficient Networks, Orckit, Terayon Communications and Texas InstrumentsWe believe that the principal competitive factors required by users and customers in the connectivity product market include compatibility with industry standards, price, functionality, ease of use and customer service and support. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. 11 We recently hired a new President and Chief Operating Officer. If he is not successful in carrying out his duties, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability or increase our revenueIn August 1999, we hired William F. Roach as our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Roach must be successfully integrated into our organizational structure. If for any reason Mr. Roach does not successfully carry out his duties or lead our organization in an effective manner, we may not be able to maintain our current profitability or increase our revenue. In order for us to maintain our profitability and continue to introduce and develop new products for emerging markets, we must attract and retain our executive officers and qualified technical, sales, support and other administrative personnelOur past performance has been and our future performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive officers and certain key engineering, sales, marketing, financial, technical and customer support personnel. If we lost the services of one or more of our executives or key employees, a replacement could be difficult to recruit and we may not be able to grow our businessWe maintain "key person" life insurance policies on Peter Chen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, William Wen-Liang Hsu, our Vice President, Engineering, and Han Yeh, our Vice President, Technology, in the face amount of $1 million for each individual. However, these insurance policies may not adequately compensate for the loss of services of any of these individualsWe intend to hire a significant number of additional engineering, sales, support, marketing and finance personnel in the future. Competition for personnel, especially engineers and marketing and sales personnel in Silicon Valley, is intense. We are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education, backgrounds and industry experience. As of June 30, 1999, we employed a total of 58 people in our engineering department, over half of whom have advanced degrees. In the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified engineering personnel, especially developers, on a timely basis. If we are not able to hire at the levels that we plan, our ability to continue to develop products and technologies responsive to our markets will be impaired. We have experienced significant growth in our business in recent periods and failure to manage our growth could strain our management, financial and administrative resourcesOur ability to successfully sell our products and implement our business plan in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective management planning process. Future expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on our management by significantly increasing the scope of their responsibilities and resources by increasing the number of people using them. We have increased, and plan to continue to increase, the scope of our operations at a rapid rate. Our headcount has grown and will continue to grow substantially. At December 31, 1998, we had a total of 95 employees and at June 30, 1999, we had a total of 125 employees. In addition, we expect to continue to hire a significant number of new employees. To effectively manage our growth, we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls, integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. We rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test our products. If these companies do not meet their commitments to us, our ability to sell products to our customers would be impairedWe do not have our own manufacturing, assembling or testing operations. Instead, we rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test the semiconductor chips which are integral components of our products. Most of these companies are located outside of the United States. There are many risks associated with our relationships with these independent companies, including reduced control over: . delivery schedules, . quality assurance, 12 . manufacturing costs, . capacity during periods of excess demand, and . availability of access to process technologiesIn addition, the location of these independent parties outside of the United States creates additional risks resulting from the foreign regulatory, political and economic environments in which each of these companies exists. While to date we have not experienced any material problems, failures or delays by our manufacturers to provide the semiconductor chips that we require for our products, or any material change in the financial arrangements we have with these companies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer product requirementsWe design, market and sell application specific integrated circuits and outsource the manufacturing and assembly of the integrated circuits to a third party fabrication. The majority of our products and related components are manufactured by five principal companies: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, ST Microelectronics, Kawasaki/LSI, Silicon Labs and Delta Integration. We expect to continue to rely upon these third parties for these services. Currently, the data access arrangement chips used in our soft modem products are provided by a sole source, Silicon Labs, on a purchase order basis, and we have only a limited guaranteed supply arrangement under a contract with our supplier. We are currently in the process of qualifying a second source for our data access arrangement chips. Although we believe that we would be able to qualify an alternative manufacturing source for data access arrangement chips within a relatively short period of time, this transition, if necessary, could result in loss of purchase orders or customer relationships, which could result in decreased revenues. Undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance of our productsOur products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released. To date, we have not been made aware of any significant software errors or failures in our products. However, despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance. If we, our key suppliers or our customers fail to be ready for the year 2000 calendar change, our business may be disrupted and our net revenues may declineThe Year 2000 issue refers to computer programs which use two digits rather than four to define a given year and which might read a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the Year 2000. As a result, many companies' systems and software may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to function correctly after December 31, 1999Our Software. Our connectivity products are incorporated into computer products of our customers which may not be Year 2000 compliant, or which may be perceived by their markets as not meeting Year 2000 compliance requirements. As a result, it is likely that any failure of the computer products into which our products may be incorporated to be Year 2000 compliant, or any slowdown in the connectivity markets as a result of Year 2000 compliance concerns, will hurt our product sales. In addition, we believe that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by Year 2000 issues as companies expend significant resources to correct or upgrade their current software systems for Year 2000 compliance. These expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase our products. To the extent Year 2000 issues cause a significant delay in, or cancellation of, decisions to purchase our products or services, our business would suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we test and evaluate our software modems. We believe that our current products are Year 2000 compliant, meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after January 1, 2000 will not materially affect the performance of our software products or the ability of our products to transmit data involving dates. 13 Third Party Equipment And Software. We use third party equipment and software that may not be Year 2000 compliant. This equipment and software includes our key internal systems such as for our internal accounting systems or controls. If this equipment or software does not operate properly with regard to the Year 2000, we may incur unexpected expenses to remedy any problems. These costs may materially adversely affect our business. In addition, if our key internal systems fail as a result of Year 2000 problems, we could incur substantial costs and disruption of our businessCompliance. Despite our current assessment, we may not identify and correct all significant Year 2000 problems on a timely basis. Year 2000 compliance efforts may involve significant time and expense and unremediated problems could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We currently do not have any estimate of potential costs related to potential Year 2000 problems. We currently do not have plans to contact our material customers. We currently have no contingency plans to address the risks associated with unremediated Year 2000 problems. To date, we have not incurred any material costs directly associated with Year 2000 compliance efforts, except for compensation expense associated with salaried employees who have devoted some of their time to Year 2000 assessment and remediation efforts. We do not expect the total cost of Year 2000 problems to be material to our business, financial condition or operating results. However, during the months prior to the century change, we will continue to evaluate new versions of our products, new software and information systems provided by third parties and any new infrastructure systems that we acquire, to determine whether they are Year 2000 compliant. Risks Related to Our Industry If the market for applications using our host signal processing technology does not grow as we anticipate, or if our products are not accepted in this market, our revenues may stagnate and may decreaseOur success depends on the growth of the market for applications using our host signal processing technology. This market has only recently begun to develop and may not develop at the growth rates that have been suggested by industry estimates. Market demand for host signal processing technology depends primarily upon the cost and performance benefits relative to other competing solutions. For example, soft modems have only recently begun to gain acceptance in the modem market. Although we have shipped a significant number of soft modems since we began commercial sales of these products in October 1995, the current level of demand for soft modems may not be sustained or may not grow. If customers do not accept soft modems or the market for soft modems does not grow, our revenues will decreaseFurther, we are in the process of developing next generation products and applications which improve and extend upon our host signal processing technology, such as a G.Lite modem solution, an external modem product and a remote access solution. If these products are not accepted in our markets when they are introduced, our revenues and profitability will be negatively affected. Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies. If we do not adapt to these technologies, our products will become obsoleteThe connectivity product mark</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all of the other information included in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any of the following risks could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate or materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition and could result in a complete loss of your investment. Risks Related to our Business We are not profitable and do not expect to achieve profitability in the near future, if at allWe have not achieved profitability. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We incurred net losses of $321,000 from inception through December 31, 1997. For the year ended December 31, 1998, we incurred additional net losses of $5.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, we incurred additional net losses of $16.0 million and had an accumulated deficit of $21.6 million as of September 30, 1999, and we expect to report additional net losses for the period since September 30, 1999Our business plan calls for us to continue to acquire and invest in operating companies. As a result, we will continue to amortize substantial amounts of goodwill. As we grow, we expect that the amount of goodwill we will amortize in connection with these investments will represent an increasingly smaller portion of our expenses. Therefore, we expect to continue to incur net losses until that point in time when the goodwill we amortize represents a sufficiently small amount of our expenses that it is exceeded by our net income before amortization. Because we cannot predict the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we do not know when we will become profitable, if ever. We have a history of negative cash flow, and we may never achieve positive cash flowFor the year ended December 31, 1998, we had losses from operations, before depreciation and amortization, of $4.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, we had losses from operations, before depreciation and amortization, of $9.0 million, and we expect to report additional losses for the period since September 30, 1999. Additionally, we used $14.3 million in 1998 and $61.3 million in the first nine months of 1999 to acquire operations and fixed assets. If we are unable to increase our revenue to cover our costs and investment expenditures, we will continue to experience negative cash flow. For information regarding our expected losses for the three months ended December 31, 1999, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis--Recent Developments" on page 24. We may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to execute our business planWe expect that the net proceeds of this offering will fund our operations for the next 12 months. After we have used the net proceeds from this offering, we will need to obtain additional debt or equity financings to fund operations, capital expenditures for expansion of network and information systems, and acquisitions. If we obtain debt financings, we may be required to agree to restrictions on our activities that could impair our ability to execute our business plan. For example, these restrictions may prohibit us from incurring additional debt or making acquisitions without prior lender approval. If we obtain additional equity financings, the per share value of our outstanding common stock may be diluted. In general, if we are unable to obtain these financings on favorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plan. Our combined operating history is limited and may not be indicative of our future performanceAlthough a number of the operating companies we have acquired have been in operation for some time, VIA itself has a limited history of operations. Consequently, the financial information in this prospectus may not be indicative of our future performance. 6 Because we have grown rapidly and we expect our growth to continue, we may have difficulty managing our growth effectively, which could adversely affect the quality of our services and the results of our operationsWe have grown rapidly and expect to continue to grow rapidly by acquiring new companies, increasing the number of customers served and increasing the number and types of products and services we offer. We have acquired 19 companies since June 1998, and agreed to acquire one other company, and the total number of our employees grew from five to 903 between June 1, 1998 and January 14, 2000. To manage our expected growth effectively, we must . implement additional management information systems . develop additional operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls . hire and train additional personnelIf we are unable to meet these demands, the quality of our services may suffer, causing us to lose customers and revenues. If we fail to integrate operating systems, networks and management of our acquired companies successfully, we may suffer operating inefficiencies and reduced operating cash flow We may not be able to integrate our acquired companies successfully because we currently operate in 12 different countries with different governmental regulations, languages, customs, currencies and availabilities of telecommunication capacity to carry data. We will have to commit substantial management, operating, financial and other resources to integrate our operating companies and implement our business model, which will reduce our operating cash flow. Because we operate in markets where extended vacations are typical, and since in some of these markets, we receive a portion of our revenues based on customer usage, we may experience seasonal variation in our quarterly revenue and operating results that could cause our stock price to declineIn Europe and Latin America, four or more weeks of vacation is typical and often mandated under law. As a result, extended summer and winter holiday vacations are common and it is difficult to attract new customers during these periods. In these markets, our customers also pay their telephone companies for the number of minutes they spend on-line, even if we provide a local telephone number that they can use for access. We may receive a portion of these fees from the telephone companies as payment for generating usage, and customer usage generally declines in the summer months, July and August in Europe and January and February in Latin America, and in December. As a result, we may experience lower revenues during these periods and our operating results may be affected. To the extent our quarterly results fluctuate more widely than expected by us, securities analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. We face increasing competition for the purchase of local Internet services providers, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitionsOur business strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to identify and acquire new local Internet services providers that meet our acquisition criteria. In pursuing these opportunities, we compete with other Internet services providers, local, regional, national and global telecommunication companies and other buyers. These competitors may drive up the price of our acquisition targets or may acquire our acquisition targets. Many of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than we have. Increasing competition has raised the price we have paid for acquisitions in some markets and may continue to do so. In addition, our acquisition targets may find our competitors more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more, or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. 7 Financial information on which we rely to make future acquisitions may not be accurate, which may result in our acquiring undisclosed liabilities or experiencing lower than expected operating resultsThe companies we target for acquisition typically do not have audited financial statements and have varying degrees of internal controls and detailed financial information. As a result, we may acquire undisclosed liabilities or experience lower-than-expected revenues or higher-than-expected costs, which could adversely affect our operating results. To date, no issues of this kind have arisen that have materially adversely affected our results; however, they may arise in the future. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the various currencies in which we conduct business may affect our operating resultsWe record the revenues and expenses of our local operations in their home currencies and translate these amounts into U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our revenues, expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations may adversely affect the comparability of period-to-period results. For example, the value of the Brazilian Real fluctuated by 45.6% in relation to the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and ended the period 37.2% lower than its value to the U.S. dollar in the beginning of the year. Since each Real converted to fewer U.S. dollars, our U.S. dollar revenue was reduced. In the past, the currencies of many Latin American countries, including Brazil and Mexico in particular, have experienced substantial devaluation and volatility. Our Latin American markets have a history of political and economic instability which may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our resultsWe derive and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from the Latin American markets. Latin America has experienced periods of political and economic instability. If these conditions were to reoccur, our business could be adversely affected. Historically, instability in Latin American countries has been caused by . extensive governmental involvement, control or ownership of industries in local economies, including telecommunications facilities, financial institutions and other commerce infrastructure . unexpected changes in regulatory requirements such as imposing licensing requirements or levying new taxes . slow or negative growth as a result of recessionary trends caused by foreign currency devaluations, interest rate hikes and inflation . imposition of trade barriers through trade restrictions, high tariffs and taxes . wage and price controls that reduce potential profitability of businesses Any occurrence of adverse political and economic conditions may deter growth in Internet usage or create uncertainty regarding our operating climate, which my adversely impact our business. Currently, we do not have political risk insurance to guard against business interruptions and other losses caused by political acts. Logistical problems or economic downturns that could result from the introduction of the Euro may affect our ability to operate and adversely impact our operating resultsOn January 1, 1999, 11 of the 15 European Union member countries adopted the Euro as their common legal currency, at which time their respective individual currencies became fixed at a rate of exchange to the Euro, and the Euro became a currency in its own right. During a January 1, 1999 to January 1, 2002 transition period, we must manage transactions with our customers and our third-party vendors who conduct business in Euro participating countries in both the Euro and the individual currencies. If we, our customers or our vendors experience systems problems in converting to the Euro, we could be unable to bill and collect from customers or pay vendors for services, and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. 8The establishment of the European Monetary Union may have a significant effect on the economies of the participant countries. Since a substantial portion of our revenue will be denominated in the Euro or currencies of European Union countries, our operating results could be adversely affected if there is a downturn in the economies of participating countries or if the Euro weakens against other currencies. Our brand names are difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third partiesWe are aware of other companies using or claiming to have rights to use our trademarks and variations of those marks, including the VIA NET.WORKS mark. In particular, one company has notified us that it believes our use of the VIA NET.WORKS mark in Brazil infringes upon its trademark applications. The users of these or similar marks may be found to have senior rights if they were ever to assert a claim against us for trademark infringement. If an infringement suit were instituted against us, even if groundless, it could result in substantial litigation expenses in defending the suit. If such a suit were to be successful, we could be forced to cease using the mark and to pay damagesWe have applied to register several of our trademarks in various countries. Our application to register in Argentina the trademark "VIA Net Works Argentina" has been opposed by a third party. If any of our applications are unsuccessful, we may be required to discontinue the use of those trademarks. Risks Related to our Industry Regulatory and economic conditions of the countries where our operating companies are located are uncertain and may decrease demand for our services, increase our cost of doing business or otherwise reduce our business prospectsOur operating companies are located in countries with rapidly changing regulatory and economic conditions which may affect the Internet services industry. Any new law or regulation pertaining to the Internet or telecommunications, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, could decrease demand for our services, increase our costs or otherwise reduce our profitability or business prospects. Specific examples of the types of laws or regulations that could adversely affect us include laws that . impose taxes on transactions made over the Internet . impose telecommunications access fees on Internet services providers . directly or indirectly affect telecommunications costs generally or the costs of Internet telecommunications specifically . prohibit the transmission over the Internet of various types of information and content . impose requirements on Internet services providers to protect Internet users' privacy or to permit government interception of data traffic . increase the likelihood or scope of competition from telecommunications or cable companiesFor example, some states of Brazil impose a tax of up to 30% on revenues generated by communications services. There has been no judicial determination that Internet access services constitute communications services. If Internet services providers are ultimately required to pay this tax, our Brazilian operations would be negatively and significantly impactedThese laws could require us to incur costs to comply with them or to incur new liability. They could also increase our competition or change our competitive environment so that customer demand for our products and services is affected. For a discussion of specific regulatory proposals that may affect our business, see "Business--Regulatory Matters."In addition to risks we face from new laws or regulations, we face uncertainties in connection with the application of existing laws to the Internet. It may take years to determine the manner in which existing laws 9 governing issues like property ownership, libel, negligence and personal privacy will be applied to communications and commerce over the Internet. Increasing competition for customers in our markets may cause us to reduce our prices or increase spending, which may negatively affect our revenues and operating resultsThere are competitors in our markets with more significant market presence and brand recognition and greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. As a result of this competition, we currently face and expect to continue to face significant pressure to reduce our prices and improve the products and services we offer. Although the competitors we face vary depending on the market and the country, these competitors may include local and regional Internet services providers, telecommunication companies and cable companies. Some of our competitors, especially the telecommunications companies, have large networks in place as well as a significant existing customer base. If demand for Internet services in our markets does not grow as we expect, our ability to grow our revenues will be negatively affectedInternet use in our markets is relatively low. If the market for Internet services fails to develop, or develops more slowly than expected, we may not be able to increase our revenues. Obstacles to the development of Internet services in our markets include: . low rates of personal computer ownership and usage . lack of developed infrastructure to develop Internet access and applications . limited access to Internet servicesIn particular, we depend on increasing demand for Internet services by small to mid-sized businesses in our geographic markets. Demand for Internet services by these businesses will depend partly on the degree to which these businesses' customers and suppliers adopt the Internet as a means of doing business, and partly on the extent to which these businesses adopt Internet technologies to deal with internal business processes, such as internal communications. We are in a rapidly evolving industry in which the products and services we offer, their methods of delivery and their underlying technologies are changing rapidly, and if we do not keep pace with these changes, we may fail to retain and attract customers, which would reduce our revenuesThe Internet services market is characterized by changing customer needs, frequent new service and product introductions, evolving industry standards and rapidly changing technology. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to recognize and respond to these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we fail to do so, we will not be able to compete successfully. We rely on telecommunications companies in our markets to provide our customers with reliable access to our services, and failures or delays in providing access could limit our ability to service our customers and impact our revenues and operating resultsOur customers access our services either through their normal telephone lines or dedicated lines provided by local telecommunications companies specifically for that use. In some of our markets, we experience delays in delivery of new telephone lines that have prevented our customers from accessing our services. These delays result in lost revenues. Additionally, some local telecommunications companies that provide Internet services provide delivery of telephone or dedicated lines to their Internet customers on a preferential basis, which may cause us to lose current and potential customers. We also lease network capacity from telecommunications companies and rely on the quality and availability of their service. These companies may experience disruptions of service which could disrupt our services to, or limit Internet access for, our customers. We may 10 not be able to replace or supplement these services on a timely basis or in a cost-effective manner, which may result in customer dissatisfaction and lost revenues. We depend on the reliability of our network, and a system failure or a breach of our security measures could result in a loss of customers and reduced revenuesWe are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damages from telecommunication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters and unauthorized access. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could impair our ability to provide Internet services to our customers and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers' data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches. Although we currently possess errors and omissions insurance and business interruption insurance, these policies may not provide effective coverage upon the occurrence of all events. We do not have insurance specifically to guard against losses resulting from computer viruses and security breaches. If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel or lose the services of our key personnel, our operating results may sufferOur success depends on our key management, engineers, sales and marketing personnel, technical support representatives and other personnel, many of whom may be difficult to replace. If we lose key personnel, we may not be able to find suitable replacements, which may negatively affect our business. In addition, since the demand for qualified personnel in our industry is very high, we may have to increase the salaries and fringe benefits we may offer to our personnel, which may affect our operating results. We do not maintain key person life insurance on, or restrictive employment agreements with, any of our executive officers. We may be liable for information disseminated over our networkWe may face liability for information carried on or disseminated through our network. Some types of laws that may result in our liability for information disseminated over our network include: . laws designed to protect intellectual property, including trademark and copyright laws . laws relating to publicity and privacy rights and laws prohibiting defamation . laws restricting the collection, use and processing of personal data and . laws prohibiting the sale, dissemination or possession of pornographic materialThe laws governing these matters vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For information about the applicable laws that may affect our liability for information carried or disseminated through our network, see "Business-- Regulatory Matters." The availability of protection for intellectual property rights in the context of the Internet remains uncertain We rely on trademark and copyright law, laws restricting unfair trade practices, laws relating to trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. The applicability and enforceability of legal principles concerning intellectual property rights in an Internet context remains substantially uncertain as the courts and legislatures in each country in which we operate continue to address the issues. Substantially all of the countries in which we operate are signatories to the same international treaties relating to the protection of intellectual property to which the United States adheres. Nonetheless, in many of these countries, the courts have not had the opportunity to address the legal issues within the Internet context to the same degree as U.S. courts. It is therefore uncertain whether the intellectual property of our non-U.S. operations will be subject to a lesser or different degree of protection than that generally afforded in the United States. 11 The Year 2000 issue could impair our ability to provide services to our customers, increase our costs, or reduce our revenues or profitabilityYear 2000 issues may adversely affect our business and our customers' businesses. Many computer systems may fail or malfunction because they are unable to distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates. We have incurred costs to upgrade our computers to address the year 2000 issue and may in the future incur additional costs. Our customers may also need to incur costs to either upgrade their computers or correct any problems their computers may encounter, which may reduce our revenues by diverting our customers' information systems resources away from our products and services. In addition, if our computer systems or those of our telecommunications suppliers fail or malfunction as a result of Year 2000 issues, our ability to provide services to our customers will be disrupted, which could result in lost revenues, lost customers or claims for damages, which could lead to costly litigation. For information on how we are addressing year 2000 issues, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure." Risks Related to this Offering We have discretion over the use of all of the net proceeds from this offering and may fail to use them effectively to grow our businessWe will retain discretion over how to use the net proceeds of this offering. Because the proceeds are not required to be allocated to any specific investment or transaction, you will not be able to determine at this time the value or appropriateness of our use of the proceeds. You will pay a higher price for our common stock than was paid by existing stockholders and will experience immediate and substantial dilutionIf you purchase common stock in this offering, you will pay more for your shares than the amounts paid by existing stockholders for their shares. As a result, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $14.54 per share, and our existing stockholders will experience an unrealized gain of $195.6 million in the aggregate. 42,068,821, or 73.7%, of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future. These sales could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing wellAfter this offering, we will have outstanding 57,068,821 shares of common stock, based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on January 14, 2000. This amount includes the 15,000,000 shares we are selling in this offering, which may be resold in the public market immediately. The remaining 73.7%, or 42,068,821 shares, of our total outstanding shares will become available for resale in the public market, subject to restrictions under federal securities laws, as shown in the chart below. For information regarding these restrictions, see "Shares Eligible for Future Sale."As restrictions on resale end, the market price could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. &lt;TABLE&gt; &lt;CAPTION&gt; Number of shares/ % of total outstanding Date of availability for resale into public market ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------- &lt;S&gt; &lt;C&gt; 41,613,184/ 180 days after the date of this prospectus due to an 72.9% agreement these stockholders have agreed to deliver to the underwriters. However, the underwriters can waive this restriction and allow these stockholders to sell their shares at any time. 455,637/ Between 90 and 365 days after the date of this 0.8% prospectus due to the requirements of the federal securities laws. &lt;/TABLE&gt; 12In addition, holders of approximately 41,340,721 shares of common stock and non-voting common stock will be entitled to registration rights with respect to their common stock. If these holders exercise their registration rights, causing a large number of shares to be sold in the public market, our market price may drop significantly. Our stock has not traded publicly and may not trade actively after this offeringPrior to this offering, you could not buy or sell our common stock publicly. We cannot assure you that an active public trading market for our stock will develop or be sustained after this offering. The market price of our common stock, like the market prices of stocks of other Internet-related and technology companies, may fluctuate widely and rapidlyThe securities of many companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, often unrelated to the companies' operating performance. Specifically, market prices for securities of Internet-related and technology companies have frequently reached elevated levels following their initial public offerings. These levels may be unsustainable and may not bear any relationship to these companies' operating performances. If the market price of our common stock reaches an elevated level following this offering, it may materially and rapidly decline. Fluctuations in our common stock's market price may affect our visibility and credibility in the Internet services provider marketIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company. If we were to become involved in a class action suit, it could be costly and divert the attention of management. Furthermore, if adversely determined, a class action suit may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The price per share of our common stock in this offering may not be indicative of the market price that will prevail after this offeringSince our stock has not yet traded publicly, our management and the underwriters will negotiate the common stock's initial public offering price per share. The price they determine may not be indicative of the market price that will prevail after this offering. For example, the market price of our common stock after this offering could vary from the initial public offering price in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond our control: . changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts . future announcements concerning us or our competitors of key personnel changes, significant contracts, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, technological innovations or capital commitments . additions or departures of key personnel . quarterly fluctuations in operating results . fluctuations in the stock price and volume of traded shares, especially in the traditionally volatile Internet-related and technology sectors 13</td>

      <td>risk factors an investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. prior to investing in our ordinary shares, we encourage each prospective investor to carefully read this entire prospectus, including, without limitation, the following risk factors and the section of this prospectus entitled cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements. any of the following factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. if any of these risks occur, the value of our ordinary shares could decline, and you could lose all or part of your original investment. risks related to our business the accessories, footwear and apparel industries are heavily influenced by general macroeconomic cycles that affect consumer spending, and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits. purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. the success of our operations depends on a number of factors impacting discretionary consumer spending, including general economic conditions, consumer confidence, wages and unemployment, housing prices, consumer debt, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, taxation and political conditions. a continuation or worsening of the current weakness in the economy may negatively affect consumer and wholesale purchases of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we may not be able to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and operating results. the accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. we believe that our success is largely dependent on our brand image and ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design, styling, production, merchandising and pricing of products. if we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately, consumers may not purchase our products and our brand name and brand image may be impaired. even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brand image to be outdated or associate our brand with styles that are no longer popular or trend-setting. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and operating results.the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within north america and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline. we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign accessories, footwear and apparel producers and retailers, including, among others, coach, burberry, ralph lauren, herms, louis vuitton, gucci, marc jacobs, chlo and prada. competition is based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, the following: anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner; establishing and maintaining favorable brand-name recognition; determining and maintaining product quality; maintaining key employees; 11 maintaining and growing market share; developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers; establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with retail customers; pricing products appropriately; providing appropriate service and support to retailers; optimizing retail and supply chain capabilities; determining size and location of retail and department store selling space; and protecting intellectual property. in addition, some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories, footwear and apparel industries, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products. the general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. competition, along with such other factors as consolidation and changes in consumer spending patterns, could also result in significant pricing pressure. these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers, which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.the departure of our founder, members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. we depend on the services and management experience of our founder and executive officers, who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. in particular, mr.kors, our honorary chairman and chief creative officer, has provided design and executive leadership to the company since its inception. he is instrumental to our marketing and publicity strategy and is closely identified with both the brand that bears his name and our company in general. our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr.kors name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. mr.kors has the right to terminate his employment with us without cause. in addition, the leadership of john d. idol, our chairman and chief executive officer, and joseph b. parsons, our executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief operating officer, has been a critical element of our success. we also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing, design and advertising operations. competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense, and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our executive officers and key employees. although we have entered into employment agreements with mr.kors and certain of our other executive officers, including mr.idol and mr.parsons, we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future. the loss of services of one or more of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to, or relating to, the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to open and operate new retail stores and increase the number of department stores and specialty stores that sell our products. as part of our growth strategy, we intend to open and operate new retail stores and shop-in-shops within select department stores, both domestically and internationally. our ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to: identify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops will be considered successful; negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances, to secure suitable store locations; hire, train and retain personnel and field management; assimilate new personnel and field management into our corporate culture; source sufficient inventory levels; and successfully integrate new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops into our existing operations and information technology systems. we will encounter pre-operating costs and we may encounter initial losses when new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops commence operations. while we expect to open a number of additional retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops in fiscal 2012, there can be no assurance that we will open the planned number, that we will recover the expenditure costs associated with opening these new retail stores, including concessions, and shop-in-shops or that the operation of these new venues will be successful or profitable. any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. we face additional risks with respect to our strategy to expand internationally, including our efforts to further expand our operations in european countries and in japan as well as other asian countries. in some of these countries we do not yet have significant operating experience, and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations. many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including, but not limited to, employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate (including lease terms) and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and, as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. in addition, in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we have grown rapidly in recent years and we have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations; if we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our brand image and financial performance may suffer. we have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating experience at our current size. our total revenue increased from $397.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $803.3 million in fiscal 2011. if our operations continue to grow, we will be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarter personnel. our continued growth could strain our existing resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, difficulties in hiring, training and managing an 13 increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products and delays in production and shipments. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.as we expand our store base, we may be unable to maintain the same comparable store sales or average sales per square foot that we have in the past, which could cause our share price to decline. as we expand our store base, we may not be able to maintain the levels of comparable store sales that we have experienced historically. in addition, we may not be able to maintain our historic average sales per square foot as we move into new markets. if our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations, the price of our ordinary shares could decline. in addition, the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. a variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot, including, among others, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. if we misjudge the market for our products, we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. these factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods and our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our ordinary shares.we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space under long-term, non-cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases; any failure to make these lease payments when due could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. we do not own any of our store facilities; instead, we lease all of our stores under operating leases. our leases generally have terms of 10 years with no renewal options. our leases generally require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs. for example, as of october 1, 2011, we were party to operating leases associated with our stores as well as other corporate facilities requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating $248.1million through fiscal 2016 and approximately $234.1 million thereafter through fiscal 2028. we expect that we will also lease any new stores we open under operating leases with terms similar to those contained in leases we have entered previously, which will further increase our operating lease expenses. our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including, among others: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; requiring a substantial portion of our available cash to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes; limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and placing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors. we depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us, we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs. our current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control. we have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell, under our trademarks, products requiring specialized expertise. we have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas, including, among others, korea, the philippines, singapore, malaysia, the middle east and turkey. our operations in china, hong kong, macau and taiwan are conducted pursuant to similar licensing agreements that we have entered into with entities that are indirectly owned by certain of our current shareholders, including mr.kors, mr.idol and sportswear holdings limited. see certain relationships and related party transactionsmichael kors far east holdings limited. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners, such arrangements may not be successful. our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the timing of new store openings, the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. in addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partners ability to: obtain capital; exercise operational and financial control over its business; manage its labor relations; maintain relationships with suppliers; manage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and maintain customer relationships. any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands. although we attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over store location and design, product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our stores and products, we may not be able to control the use by our licensing partners of each of our licensed brands. the misuse of our brands by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers, and the loss of any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenue. a small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales. net sales to our five largest wholesale customers were 30.4% of our total revenue for fiscal 2011 and 35.7% of our total revenue for fiscal 2010. our largest wholesale customer, a large, nationally recognized u.s. department store, accounted for 13.8% of our total revenue for fiscal 2011 and 14.5% of our total revenue for fiscal 2010. we do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale customers, and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. a decision by any of our major wholesale customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. during the past several years, the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes, and we expect such changes will continue. in addition, store closings by our wholesale customers decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a 15 smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. in the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores target markets. any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. these changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.a material disruption in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely extensively on our information technology (it) systems to track inventory, manage our supply chain, record and process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. the failure of our it systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or difficulty in integrating new systems could adversely affect our business. in addition, our it systems may be subject to damage and/or interruption from power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and usage errors by our employees. if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim. any significant disruption in our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.direct privacy breaches and the engagement of third parties to operate our e-commerce business could negatively affect our reputation, credibility and business. we are responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce website, michaelkors.com, and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. consumers are increasingly concerned over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. in addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our customers identity and privacy. we do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future. any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers. finally, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding unauthorized disclosure of personal information, to the extent they are applicable.increases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer. the costs of raw materials used in our products are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. we are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials, and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials. the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain, but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. if one or more of our distribution facilities becomes inoperable, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. we operate a limited number of distribution facilities. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities. if any of these distribution 16 facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our customers and retail stores. in addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged facility. in addition, we currently operate our california distribution from three separate warehouses totaling approximately 350,000 square feet. the leases for these three facilities expire on march31, 2012. we have executed a lease for an approximately 500,000 square foot distribution center in whittier, california, which we believe will allow us to significantly increase our distribution capabilities and efficiency. we took possession of the new distribution center in october 2011 and intend to complete our transition into this facility prior to the march31, 2012 expiration of the leases for our existing california distribution facilities. as part of this transition, we will implement a new warehouse management system that will supplement our current legacy system and further support our efforts to operate with increased efficiency and flexibility. there are risks inherent in transitioning our existing three distribution facilities into one new facility and in implementing a new warehouse management system, including the risk of late delivery of possession of the new facility, difficulty in negotiating acceptable terms to remain temporarily in the existing facilities in the event of any such late delivery and other operational difficulties that may arise in commencing operations in a new facility with a new management system. any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.we primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations. our products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors located mainly in countries in asia, europe and central and south america. a manufacturing contractors failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. the failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any of the following factors could negatively affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results: political or labor instability, labor shortages or increases in costs of labor or production in countries where manufacturing contractors and suppliers are located; political or military conflict involving the united states, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials and increase transportation costs; heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods of time or could result in increased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands; a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials; disease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas; the migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced; imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust in a timely manner to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed; increases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation; imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; 17 significant fluctuation of the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies; and restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located. we do not have written agreements with any of our third-party manufacturing contractors. as a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. in fiscal 2011, our largest manufacturing contractor, who primarily produces its products in china and who we have worked with for the last seven years, accounted for the production of 30.5% of our finished products. our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, we use third-party agents to source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf. we do not have written agreements with any of our agents. as a result, any single agent could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. in fiscal 2011, our largest third-party agent, whose primary place of business is hong kong and who we have worked with for the last seven years, sourced approximately 19.5% of our purchases of finished goods. our inability to promptly replace agents that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality service in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.if our manufacturing contractors fail to use acceptable, ethical business practices, our business and reputation could suffer. we require our manufacturing contractors to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those three areas in order to promote ethical business practices, and our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our manufacturing contractors to determine compliance. however, we do not control our manufacturing contractors or their labor and other business practices. if one of our manufacturing contractors violates applicable labor or other laws, rules or regulations or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. we have a $100.0 million
