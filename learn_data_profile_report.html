    <th>RISK FACTORS AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OFFERED BY THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS, THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN EVALUATING AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMMON STOCK. THIS PROSPECTUS CONTAINS CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSEPROJECTED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF ANY NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS. ABSENCE OF COMBINED OPERATING HISTORY; RISKS OF INTEGRATING FOUNDING COMPANIES. Metals USA was founded in 1996 but has conducted no operations and generated no net sales to date. Metals USA has entered into definitive agreements to acquire the Founding Companies simultaneously with, and as a condition to, the closing of this Offering. The Founding Companies have been operating as separate independent entities, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to integrate the operations of these businesses successfully or to institute the necessary systems and procedures, including accounting and financial reporting systems, to manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis. The Company's management group has been assembled only recently, and there can be no assurance that the management group will be able to manage the combined entity or to implement effectively the Company's acquisition and internal growth operating strategies. The pro forma combined historical financial results of the Founding Companies cover periods when theFounding Companies and Metals USA were not under common control or management and may not be indicative of the Company's future financial or operating results. The inability of the Company to integrate the Founding Companies successfully would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations and would make it unlikely that the Company's acquisition program will be successful. See "Business -- Strategy" and "Management." POSSIBLE IMPACT OF VARYING METAL PRICES. The principal raw materials used by the Company are steel, aluminum and various specialty metals. The metals industry as a whole is cyclical, and at times pricing and availability of raw materials in the metals industry can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including general, domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, production levels, competition, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for the Company, and may, therefore, adversely affect the Company's net sales, operating margin and net income. During the last five years, carbon steel prices for the FoundingCompanies have increased an average of 2.7% per year. Aluminum prices have declined approximately 7% per year for the past two years. While the overall trend of steel and aluminum prices has been relatively stable, prices have fluctuated approximately 10% up or down during interim periods. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations." The Company's service centers maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of its customers. Accordingly, the Company purchases metal in an effort to maintain its inventory at levels that it believes to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of its customers based on information derived from customers, market conditions, historic usage and industry research. TheCompany's commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time the Company places its orders. The Company has no long-term, fixed-price purchase contracts. During periods of rising raw materials pricing, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers. When raw material prices decline, customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and, as theCompany uses existing inventory, lower margins. Changing metal prices could adversely affect the Company's operating margin and net income. CYCLICALITY OF DEMAND. Many of the Company's products are sold to industries that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and other factors beyond the control of the Company. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its level of sales in periods of economic stagnation or downturn. 10 RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION STRATEGY. The Company intends to grow significantly through the acquisition of additional value-added metals processors/service centers and manufacturers. The Company expects to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify, acquire or manage profitably additional businesses or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses into the Company without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties. Further, acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results, diversion of management's attention, failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on theCompany's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Founding Companies or other businesses acquired in the future will achieve anticipated net sales and earnings. See "Business -- Strategy." RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITION FINANCING. The timing, size and success of the Company's acquisition efforts and the associated capital commitments cannot be readily predicted. The Company currently intends to finance future acquisitions by using shares of its Common Stock for all or a substantial portion of the consideration to be paid. If the Common Stock does not maintain a sufficient market value, or if potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept Common Stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses, the Company may be required to utilize more of its cash resources, if available, in order to initiate and maintain its acquisition program. Upon consummation of this Offering, the Company will have $13.1 million of net proceeds remaining for future acquisitions and working capital after payment of Merger and Offering expenses and the cash portion of the purchase price for the Founding Companies. If the Company does not have sufficient cash resources, its growth could be limited unless it is able to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financings. Upon consummation of this Offering, the Company has obtained a commitment for a bank line of credit of $150.0 million for working capital and acquisitions. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing it may need for its acquisition program on terms that the Company deems acceptable. See "Use ofProceeds" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Combined liquidity and capital resources." RISKS RELATED TO INTERNAL GROWTH AND OPERATING STRATEGIES. Key elements of the Company's strategy are to improve the profitability of the Founding Companies and subsequently acquired businesses and to continue to expand the net sales of the Founding Companies and any subsequently acquired businesses.Although the Company intends to seek to improve the profitability of the Founding Companies and any subsequently acquired businesses by various means, including realizing overhead and purchasing efficiencies, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to do so. The Company's ability to increase the net sales of the Founding Companies and any subsequently acquired businesses will be affected by various factors, including demand for metals, pricing and availability of raw materials, the Company's ability to expand the range of products and services offered by each Founding Company and any subsequently acquired businesses and the Company's ability to successfully enter new markets. Many of these factors are beyond the control of the Company, and there can be no assurance that the Company's strategies will be successful or that it will be able to generate cash flow adequate for its operations and to support internal growth. A key component of the Company's strategy is to operate the Founding Companies and subsequently acquired businesses on a decentralized basis, with local management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations, profitability and the growth of the business. If proper overall business controls are not implemented, this decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices at the Founding Companies and subsequently acquired businesses and the Company's overall profitability could be adversely affected. See "Business -- Strategy -- Operating on aDecentralized Basis." COMPETITION. The Company is engaged in a highly-fragmented and competitive industry. The Company competes with a large number of other value-added metals processors/service centers on a regional and local basis, some of which may have greater financial resources than the Company and several of which are public companies. The Company also competes to a lesser extent with primary metals 11 producers, who typically sell to very large customers requiring regular shipments of large volumes of metals. The Company may also face competition for acquisition candidates from those public companies that have acquired a number of metals service center businesses during the past decade. Other smaller metals processors/service centers may also seek acquisitions from time to time.Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net sales and profitability. See "Business -- Competition." REGULATION. The Company's operations are subject to a number of federal, state and local regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to workplace health and safety. In particular, the Company's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing waste disposal, air and water emissions, the handling of hazardous substances, environment protection, remediation, workplace exposure and other matters.Hazardous materials the Company uses in its operations primarily include lubricants, cleaning solvents and hydrochloric acid used in its pickling operations at two facilities. Some of the properties owned or leased by the Company are located in industrial areas close to properties with histories of heavy industrial use, three of which are on or near sites listed on the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA") National Priority List. The Company believes that as many as three of the properties leased by Founding Companies have been contaminated by pollutants which have migrated from neighboring facilities or have been deposited by prior occupants. Prior to entering into the agreements relating to the Mergers, the Company evaluated the properties owned or leased by the Founding Companies and engaged an independent environmental consulting firm to conduct or review assessments of environmental conditions at these properties. Although no environmental claims have been made against the Company and it has not been named as a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or any other party, it is possible that the Company could be identified by the Environmental ProtectionAgency, a state agency or one or more third parties as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or under analogous state laws. If so, the Company could incur substantial litigation costs to prove it is not responsible for the environmental damage. The Company has obtained limited indemnities from the stockholders of the Founding Companies (ranging from approximately $50,000 to $7.6 million per Founding Company) whose facilities are located at the contaminated sites. The Company believes that these indemnities will be adequate to protect it from a material adverse effect on its financial condition should the Company be found to be responsible for a share of the clean-up costs. The limited indemnities are subject to certain deductible amounts, however, and there can be no assurance that the limited indemnities will fully protect theCompany. See "Business -- Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters." RELIANCE ON KEY PERSONNEL. Due in part to the Company's decentralized operating strategy, the Company will be highly dependent on the continuing efforts of its executive officers and the senior management of the Founding Companies, and the Company likely will depend on the senior management of any significant business it acquires in the future. The business or prospects of theCompany could be affected adversely if any of these persons does not continue in his management role until the Company is able to attract and retain qualified replacements. See "Management." CONTROL BY EXISTING MANAGEMENT AND STOCKHOLDERS. Following the consummation of the Mergers and this Offering, the Company's executive officers and directors, former stockholders of the Founding Companies and entities affiliated with them will beneficially own approximately 71.6% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (68.7% if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), of which Notre, management of and consultants toMetals USA will own 4,753,414 shares of Common Stock, representing 22.9% of all shares of Common Stock outstanding, for which they paid $.01 per share. Of these shares of Common Stock, 3,122,914 shares are Restricted Common Stock, which are entitled to elect one member of the Company's Board of Directors and to 0.55 of one vote for each share held on all other matters on which they are entitled to vote. Holders of Restricted Common Stock are not entitled to vote on the election of any other directors. These holders of Common Stock will control in the aggregate 17.3% of 12 the votes of all shares of Common Stock, and, if acting in concert, will be able to exercise control over the Company's affairs, to elect the entire Board ofDirectors and to control the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders. See "Principal Stockholders." SUBSTANTIAL PROCEEDS OF OFFERING PAYABLE TO AFFILIATES OF FOUNDING COMPANIES. Of the net proceeds of this Offering, $27.8 million, or 54.7% will be paid as the cash portion of the purchase price for the Founding Companies.Certain of the Founding Companies have incurred indebtedness which has been personally guaranteed by their stockholders or by entities controlled by its stockholders. Some of the recipients of these funds will become directors of the Company or holders of more than 5% of the Common Stock. At March 31, 1997, the aggregate amount of indebtedness of these Founding Companies that was subject to personal guarantees was approximately $40.7 million. After March 31, 1997, theFounding Companies borrowed $18.6 million to fund the S Corporation Distributions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this Offering, together with borrowings available from the Company's revolving credit facility (see "Use of Proceeds"), to repay substantially all of the indebtedness of the Founding Companies. Additionally, Notre has agreed to advance to Metals USA until the consummation of the Mergers and the Offering such funds as are necessary to effect the Mergers and this Offering and will be reimbursed from the proceeds of this Offering in respect of such expenses. As of March 31, 1997,Notre had advanced the Company $1.1 million for such expenses. In 1997, 985,500 shares of Common Stock have been issued to management and certain consultants to the Company at a price of $0.01 per share. See "Certain Transactions." BENEFITS TO NOTRE AND MANAGEMENT. Notre, management and certain consultants to the Company own in the aggregate 4,753,414 shares of CommonStock. These stockholders acquired their Common Stock at a price of $0.01 per share. These parties will own, in the aggregate, appproximately 22.9% of the outstanding Common Stock following the consummation of this Offering, which have a value of approximately $47.5 million. Of these shares of Common Stock, 3,122,914 shares are Restricted Common Stock, which are entitled to elect one member of the Company's Board of Directors and to 0.55 of one vote for each share held on all other matters on which they are entitled to vote. Holders ofRestricted Common Stock are not entitled to vote on the election of any other directors and will control in the aggregate 8.9% of the votes of all shares of Common Stock. See "Principal Stockholders." NO PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET AND DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE. Prior to this Offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock. Therefore, the initial public offering price for the Common Stock was determined by negotiation between the Company and the Representatives of the Underwriters and may bear no relationship to the price at which the Common Stock will trade after theOffering. See "Underwriting" for the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price. The Common Stock has been approved for quotation on The New York Stock Exchange. However, there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop subsequent to this Offering or, if developed, that it will be sustained. After this Offering, the market price of the CommonStock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including the timing of any acquisitions by the Company, variations in the Company's annual or quarterly financial results or those of its competitors, changes by financial research analysts in their estimates of the future earnings of the Company, conditions in the economy in general or in the Company's industry in particular, unfavorable publicity or changes in applicable laws and regulations (or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof) affecting the Company or the metals industry. From time to time, the stock market experiences significant price and volume volatility, which may affect the market price of the Common Stock for reasons unrelated to the Company's performance. POTENTIAL EFFECT OF SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE ON PRICE OF COMMONSTOCK. Upon consummation of the Mergers and this Offering, 20,782,023 shares of Common Stock will be outstanding. The 5,900,000 shares sold in this Offering (other than shares that may be purchased by affiliates of the Company) will be freely tradable. The remaining outstanding shares may be resold publicly only following their registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or pursuant to an available exemption from registration (such as provided by Rule 144 following a one year holding period for previously unregistered shares). The holders of these remaining shares have certain demand rights to have their shares 13 registered in the future under the Securities Act, but may not exercise such demand registration rights, and have agreed with the Company that they will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of their shares, for one year following the consummation of this Offering. On completion of this Offering, theCompany also will have outstanding options to purchase up to a total of 2,171,024 shares of Common Stock. The Company intends to register all the shares subject to these options under the Securities Act for public resale. The Company intends to register 8,000,000 additional shares of Common Stock under the Securities Act within 90 days after completion of this Offering for issuance in connection with future acquisitions. These shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance by persons not affiliated with the Company unless the Company contractually restricts their resale. Sales, or the availability for sale of, substantial amounts of the Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices and the future ability of the Company to raise equity capital and complete any additional acquisitions for CommonStock. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." POSSIBLE ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECT OF CERTAIN CHARTER PROVISIONS. Metals USA's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") authorizes the Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, one or more series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights (including preferences over the Common Stock respecting dividends and distributions and voting rights) as the Board of Directors may determine. The issuance of this "blank-check" preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. In addition, the Certificate of Incorporation provides for a classified Board of Directors, which may also have the effect of inhibiting or delaying a change in control of the Company. Certain provisions of the DelawareGeneral Corporation Law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by the Board of Directors. See "Description of Capital Stock." IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION. Purchasers of Common Stock in this Offering will experience immediate, substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of their stock of $7.76 per share and may experience further dilution in that value from issuances of Common Stock in connection with future acquisitions. See "Dilution." 14</th>

    <th>RISK FACTORS This offering involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks before you decide to buy our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Because we have a short operating history, there is a limited amount of information about us upon which you can evaluate our business and potential for future successWe were incorporated in October 1996 and have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. You must consider the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets, such as the market for Internet professional services. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks and uncertainties, our ability to execute our business plan would be materially and adversely affected. We had an accumulated deficit of $8.3 million as of September 30, 1999, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable futureWe have had substantial losses since our inception and our operating losses may continue and even increase in the future. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly, especially in the areas of sales, marketing and recruiting, and, as a result, we will need to generate increased quarterly revenues to become profitable. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will ever become or remain profitable. If our revenues fail to grow at anticipated rates or our operating expenses increase without a commensurate increase in our revenues, our financial condition will be adversely affected. It is unlikely that the growth rates we have experienced in recent periods will continue at their current levels. Our inability to become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter in future periods, and, as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of our investors and analysts, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate or declineOur revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and could fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include: . demand for our services; . our ability to attract and retain clients; . our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; . the number, timing and significance of new services introduced by our competitors; . our ability to develop, market and introduce new and enhanced services on a timely basis; . the level of service and price competition; . changes in operating expenses; and . changes in the mix of services offered. Our operating expenses are relatively fixed A substantial portion of our operating expense is related to personnel costs, marketing programs and overhead, which cannot be adjusted quickly and are therefore relatively fixed in the short term. Our operating expense levels are based, in significant part, on our expectations of future revenue. If actual revenues are below our expectations, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. 8Period-to-period comparisons may be unreliable Due to all of the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed in this prospectus, you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this event, the market price of our common stock is likely to fall. Our success depends on a limited number of significant clients, and our revenues could be negatively affected by the loss of a major client or significant projectWe generate much of our revenues from a limited number of clients. As a result, if we lose a major client or large project, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In 1998, for example, our three largest clients, Chevron, Johnstone Supply and Toyota, accounted for approximately 51% of our total net revenues. During the nine months ended September 30, 1999, our three largest professional services clients, Allmerica, Chevron and U.S. West, collectively accounted for approximately 54% of our total net revenues. In addition, a fourth client, CEE, for whom we perform educational services, accounted for 18% of our total net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 1999We perform varying amounts of work for specific clients from year to year. A major client in one year may not use our services in another year. In addition, we may derive revenues from a major client that constitutes a large portion of a particular quarter's total revenues. If we lose any major clients or any of our clients cancel or significantly reduce a large project's scope, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we expect the size of these contracts to grow, resulting in a continued dependence on significant clients. Also, if we fail to collect a large account receivable, we could be subjected to significant financial exposure. Our lack of long-term client contracts reduces the predictability of our revenues because these contracts may be canceled on short notice and without penaltyOur clients generally retain us on a project-by-project basis, rather than under long-term contracts. As a result, a client may not engage us for further services once a project is completed. Also, most of our clients can reduce or cancel their contracts with little or no notice and without penalty. If a significant client, or a number of clients, terminate, significantly reduce or modify their contracts with us, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Consequently, you should not predict or anticipate our future revenues based on the number of clients we have or the number and size of our existing projects. When a client postpones, modifies or cancels a project, we must shift our consultants to other projects to minimize the adverse impact on our operating results. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in efficiently shifting our consultants to new projects in the event of project terminations. We may lose money on fixed-price contractsAs part of our strategy, we intend to enter into more fixed-price contracts, rather than contracts based on payment for time and materials. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 12% of our professional services revenues. In addition, the average size of our contracts has increased in recent periods, which increases our exposure to the financial risks of fixed-price contracts. We assume greater financial risk on fixed-price contracts than on time-and-materials engagements, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully price our larger contracts. We have only a limited history in estimating our costs for our engagements, particularly for larger projects. In the past, we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete certain projects, resulting in lower gross margins on these projects. We may experience similar situations in the future. If we fail to estimate accurately the resources and time required for an engagement, to manage client expectations effectively or to complete fixed- price engagements within our budget, on time and to our clients' satisfaction, we would be exposed to cost overruns, potentially leading to losses on these engagements. 9 We depend on our key personnel, and the loss of any key personnel could disrupt our operations, adversely affect our business and result in reduced revenuesOur future success will depend on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and other key employees, in particular the services of: . Joseph M. Bellini, our President and Chief Executive Officer; . Richard C. Putz, our Executive Vice President, Worldwide Industries; . R. Jeffrey Spurrier, our Executive Vice President, Worldwide Operations; . Mark A. Cosway, our Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; . Donald W. Amaya, our Executive Vice President, Human Resources; and . Richard O. Wester, our Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThe loss of the services of any of these individuals could seriously impair our ability to execute our business plan, which could reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to hire, train and retain qualified employees is crucial to our ability to compete effectivelyTo succeed, we must hire, train, motivate, retain and successfully manage employees with skills related to the Internet and its rapidly changing technologies. Because of the recent and rapid growth of the Internet, professionals who have Internet expertise and can perform the services we offer are scarce, and competition for these individuals is intense. We might not be able to hire enough experienced professionals or to train, motivate, retain and successfully manage the employees we do hire. This could hinder our ability to complete existing projects and bid for new projects. In addition, because the competition for qualified professionals in the Internet industry is intense, hiring, training, motivating and retaining professionals with the strategic, technical and creative skills we need is both time-consuming and expensive. While our key employees are subject to non-competition agreements, these agreements may be difficult to enforce. As a result, our employees may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own companies in competition with us. If we fail to attract, train and retain key personnel, our business would be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to successfully manage our growth which could adversely affect our businessWe have grown rapidly and expect to continue to grow rapidly, both by hiring new employees and serving new industry and geographic markets. Our recent growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our management and our operating and financial systems. Our headcount has grown from 57 as of December 31, 1997 to 183 as of September 30, 1999, and several members of our senior management team have only recently joined us. We do not believe our recent growth rate is sustainable for the long termOur personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations. In order to accommodate the increased number of projects, clients and the increased size of our operations, we will need to hire, train and retain appropriate personnel to manage our operations. We will also need to improve our financial and management controls, reporting systems and operating systems. We currently plan to redesign several internal systems, including our recruiting and engagement management systems. We may encounter difficulties in developing and implementing these new systems. Historically, we have depended on third-party educational seminars to generate a substantial majority of our client engagements, and the success of our business will depend on our ability to develop effective sales and marketing capabilitiesHistorically, we have derived a substantial majority of our client engagements from sales leads generated by educational seminars produced in conjunction with CEE and Professor John J. Donovan. In the event that 10 either CEE or Professor Donovan is no longer able to perform these services, our revenues could be adversely affected. While these seminars will continue to be an important source of sales leads for client engagements, we have begun to develop our own sales and marketing capabilities as well. However, there is intense competition for sales personnel in our business, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting, integrating, motivating and retaining new sales personnel. In addition, we have limited experience in marketing our services with a direct sales force. Unlike our educational seminars, our direct sales force may be unable to establish client contacts at senior management levels, which may limit the effectiveness of those contacts and limit future revenue growth. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the Internet's rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards and changing client requirementsThe market for Internet professional services is relatively new and evolving rapidly. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to provide services that are accepted by our existing and future clients as an integral part of their business model. Demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services are subject to a high level of uncertainty. The level of demand for Internet professional services will depend upon a number of factors, including the following: . the growth in consumer access to, and acceptance of, new interactive technologies such as the Internet; . the adoption of Internet-based business models; and . the development of technologies that facilitate two-way communication between companies and targeted audiencesSignificant issues concerning the commercial use of Internet technologies, including security, reliability, cost, ease of use and quality of service, remain unresolved and may inhibit the growth of eBusiness solutions that utilize these technologies. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to meet these challenges, which must be met in a timely and cost- effective manner. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in effectively meeting these challenges, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our businessIndustry analysts and others have made many predictions concerning the growth of the Internet as a business medium. Many of these historical predictions have overstated the growth of the Internet. These predictions should not be relied upon as conclusive. The market for our services may not develop, our services may not be adopted and individual personal computer users in business or at home may not use the Internet or other interactive media for commerce and communication. If the market for Internet professional services fails to develop, or develops more slowly than expected, or if our services do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Future acquisitions or investments could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our businessWe anticipate that a portion of any future growth may be accomplished by acquiring existing businesses. The success of any acquisitions will depend upon, among other things, our ability to integrate acquired personnel, operations, products and technologies into our organization effectively, to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers of acquired firms. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations. In addition, as a public company, it may be more difficult to acquire additional companies and the cost of acquiring businesses may increase relative to the cost of similar acquisitions when we were a private company. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Any future acquisitions would involve certain other risks, including the assumption of additional liabilities, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and diversion of management's attention from other 11 business concerns. Furthermore, we may issue equity securities or incur debt to pay for any future acquisitions. If we issue equity securities, your percentage ownership of our company would be reduced. Competition in the Internet professional services market is intense, and therefore we may lose projects to our competitors or prospective clients' internal IT departmentsWhile the market for Internet professional services is relatively new, it is already highly competitive. In many cases we compete with the in-house technical staff of our prospective clients. In addition, the market is characterized by an increasing number of entrants that have introduced or developed services similar to those offered by us. We believe that competition will intensify and increase in the future. Our target market is rapidly evolving and is subject to continuous technological change. As a result, our competitors may be better positioned to address these developments or may react more favorably to these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Existing or future competitors may develop or offer Internet professional services that provide significant technological, creative, performance, price or other advantages over the services we offer. There are many competitors in the market for Internet professional services We currently compete for client assignments and experienced personnel principally with the following: . Internet service firms: AGENCY.COM, iXL, Modem Media.Poppe Tyson, Online Marketing Communications, Organic Online, Proxicom, Razorfish, Scient, USWeb/CKS and Viant. . Systems integrators: Andersen Consulting, Cambridge Technology Partners, Cap Gemini, EDS, Sapient and WM-Data. . Management consulting firms: Bain, Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey. . Computer hardware and service vendors: Compaq, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and IBM. . Advertising agencies: Bates, DDB Needham, Grey Advertising, McCann- Erickson and Ogilvy & MatherMany of these businesses have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and managerial resources than we do. There are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. We have no patented or other proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the Internet professional services market. Therefore, we must rely on the skill of our personnel and the quality of our client service. The costs to develop and provide Internet professional services are low. We expect that we will continue to face additional competition from new entrants into the market in the future, and we are subject to the risk that our employees may leave us and may start competing businesses. Any one or more of these factors could hurt our business. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our businessOur future success will depend, in part, upon our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect these rights. We do not have any patents or patent applications pending. Existing trade secret and copyright laws afford us only limited protection. Third parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our solutions or technologies. This is particularly true in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Others may independently develop and obtain patents or copyrights for technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. If that happens, we may need to license these technologies and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in any future intellectual property litigation we may be forced to do one or more of the following: . cease selling or using technology or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 12 . obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to use the relevant technology; . configure services to avoid infringement; and . refund license fees or other payments that we have previously receivedGenerally, we develop software applications for specific client engagements. Issues relating to ownership of and rights to use software applications and frameworks can be complicated. We may become involved in disputes that affect our ability to resell or reuse these applications and frameworks. Also, we may have to pay economic damages in these disputes which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Difficulties in transitioning to new software systems may negatively affect our businessWe currently use PC and network-based software for our management systems. Our current financial software is designed for small to medium-sized companies. Our human resources, recruiting and resource management systems are mainly database and spreadsheet driven. We have purchased and are currently planning to implement Oracle's integrated financial, human resources and project software. We are also evaluating our recruiting and customer relationship management systems. However, these new systems are expensive, and we may encounter difficulties in transitioning to them. Difficulties encountered with developing, implementing or operating such systems could materially and adversely affect our business. Our failure to meet client expectations or deliver error-free services could result in losses and negative publicityOur client engagements involve the creation, implementation and maintenance of eBusiness solutions that are often critical to our clients' businesses. Any defects or errors in these applications or a failure to meet client expectations could result in: . delayed or lost revenues due to adverse client reaction; . the provision of additional services to a client at no charge; . negative publicity regarding us and our services, which could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients; and . claims for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for any damagesOur contracts generally contain provisions intended to limit our liability for damages that may arise from negligent acts, errors, mistakes or omissions in rendering services to our clients. However, we cannot assure you that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages. Furthermore, our general liability insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or be sufficient to cover large claims. In addition, the insurer may disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of any large claim against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. Problems relating to the "Year 2000 Issue" could adversely affect our businessYear 2000 issues may adversely affect our business and our clients' businesses. Many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two-digit year entries in the date code field. Consequently, on January 1, 2000, many of these systems could fail or malfunction because they may not be able to distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates. As a result, computer systems and software used by many companies, including us, our clients and our prospective clients, may need to be upgraded to comply with such "Year 2000" requirements. Any failure on the part of our principal internal systems, the systems that we create for our prospective clients and other existing systems of our clients, could seriously harm our business, financial condition and operating results. For a more detailed description of our Year 2000 assessment, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Impact of Year 2000." 13 To remain competitive, we may need additional financing, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at allWe expect the net proceeds from this offering, together with current cash and available borrowings under our credit facilities, will be sufficient for us to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need additional financing sooner if we: . decide to expand faster than planned; . develop new or enhanced services or products ahead of schedule; . need to respond to competitive pressures; or . decide to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologiesIf we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your percentage ownership will be reduced. In addition, these transactions may dilute the value of our common stock. We may have to issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If future financing is not available or is not available on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to fund our business plan which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our international expansion plans may not succeedA key element of our strategy is to expand our operations into international markets. We currently have professionals operating in London, England and Sydney, Australia. We have limited experience in marketing, selling and delivering our services internationally, and we may have difficulty in managing our international operations because of distance, as well as language and cultural differences. We cannot assure you that we will be able to market and deliver our services successfully in foreign marketsOther risks related to our international operations include: . fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the conversion to the euro by all members of the European Union by year-end 2003; . difficulties arising from staffing and managing foreign operations; . longer payment cycles; . restrictions and the reduced protection of intellectual property; . restrictions on the import and export of sensitive U.S. technologies, such as data security and encryption technologies that we may wish to use in solutions we develop for customers; . legal and regulatory requirements of different countries, such as differing tax or labor laws; and . potential political and economic instabilityIf any of these risks materialize, we may have difficulty in managing our international operations and expansion. Risks Related to the Internet Professional Services Industry Our future success will depend on the continued growth and development of the Internet and its infrastructure Our future success will depend on the continued growth and use of the Internet. We cannot assure you that this growth will continue or that a sufficient number of consumers will adopt and continue to use the Internet. Internet usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons, including: . inadequate Internet infrastructure; 14 . security concerns; . inconsistent quality of service; or . unavailability of cost-effective, high-speed access servicesWe cannot assure you that the Internet infrastructure will be able to support expected growth or that the performance and reliability of the Internet will not decline as a result of this growth. Recently, many web sites, including those of our clients, have experienced a variety of interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the Internet network infrastructure. If these outages or delays frequently occur in the future, web usage could grow more slowly than anticipated or decline. Our future success will depend on the development of the eBusiness market, which remains uncertainOur future success will depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the Internet as an effective medium of commerce by businesses and consumers. Rapid growth in the use of the Internet and commercial online services is a recent phenomenon. Demand for recently introduced services and products over the Internet and online services is subject to a high level of uncertainty. The continued development of the Internet and eBusiness as a viable commercial marketplace is subject to a number of factors, including the following: . the willingness of buyers to shift their purchasing habits from traditional vendors to eBusiness vendors; . insufficient availability of telecommunications services providing sufficiently fast response times; and . adverse publicity and consumer concern about the security of eBusiness transactions. Breaches of security and computer viruses on the Internet may adversely affect our business by slowing the growth of eBusinessThe need to securely transmit confidential information, such as credit card and other personal information, over the Internet has been a significant barrier to eBusiness and Internet communications. Any well-publicized compromise of security could deter consumers and businesses from using the Internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information, such as purchases of goods or services. Furthermore, computer viruses that spread over the Internet could disable or damage the systems we develop for our clients. Decreased Internet traffic or eBusiness sales as a result of general security concerns or viruses could cause companies to reduce their amount of technology spending, which could hurt our results of operations. We face risks associated with government regulation of, and legal uncertainties surrounding, the InternetAny new law or regulation pertaining to the Internet, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, could increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications, commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent. The laws governing the Internet, however, remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws governing intellectual property, copyright, privacy, obscenity, libel and taxation apply to the Internet. In addition, the growth and development of eBusiness may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad. 15 Risks Associated With This Offering The future sale of substantial amounts of our common stock may negatively affect our stock priceThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of shares of common stock in the market after this offering, or the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, we have a significant number of shares that are subject to outstanding options and warrants. The exercise of these options and warrants and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock could cause a further decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. For a more detailed description of the number of shares that may be sold following this offering, see "Shares Eligible for Future Sale" on page 61. The future issuance of preferred stock may dilute the rights of our common stockholdersFollowing this offering, our board of directors will have the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, privileges and other terms of the shares. The board of directors may exercise this authority without any further approval of the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. We have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attemptsCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that you as a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include: . authorizing the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a hostile takeover attempt; . prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which will allow a majority of stockholders to control the election of all directors; . requiring super-majority voting to effect certain amendments to our ce</th>

    <th>RISK FACTORS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS AND OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE PURCHASING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS VERY CYCLICAL, AND AN INDUSTRY DOWNTURN WOULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES The semiconductor industry is characterized by: - rapid technological change; - cyclical market patterns; - significant price erosion; - periods of over-capacity and production shortages; - variations in manufacturing costs and yields; and - significant expenditures for capital equipment and product developmentThe semiconductor industry has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions. In the past, business conditions in this industry have rapidly changed from periods of strong demand to periods of weak demand. Any future downturn in the industry could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. We cannot assure you that we will not experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions or other factors. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND EXPECT THESE FLUCTUATIONS TO CONTINUE, WHICH MAY CAUSE OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE TO DECLINEOur quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect our net sales, gross margins and operating results. These factors include: - the volume and timing of orders received; - market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers; - competitive pricing pressures; - our ability to expand manufacturing output to meet increasing demand; - the timing and extent of our research and development expenses; and - fluctuations in manufacturing yieldsHistorically in the semiconductor industry, average selling prices of products have decreased over time. If we are unable to introduce new proprietary products with higher margins or reduce manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our existing products, then our operating results will be harmed. Our business is characterized by short-term orders and shipment schedules, and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer. Because most of our backlog is cancelable without penalty, we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. In addition, because of fixed costs in the semiconductor industry, we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls. As a result of the foregoing factors, or the other risk factors discussed in this prospectus, we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in future periods. 8 IF WE CANNOT INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY SUFFERThe markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions. Our success depends upon our ability to develop improved power semiconductors for new and existing markets, to introduce these products in a timely manner, and to have these products gain market acceptance. The development of new power semiconductors is highly complex and from time to time we have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products. Successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors, including: - proper new product definition; - timely completion of design and testing of new products; - achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields; and - market acceptance of our products and the products of our customersWe cannot assure you we will be able to meet these challenges or adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost-effectively as necessary to compete successfully. Due to the complexity and variety of power semiconductors, the limited number of qualified development engineers and the limited effectiveness of computer-aided design systems in the design of such circuits, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that any products introduced by us will be adopted by existing or potential customers, or that any products initially accepted by our customers will become industry standard products. Our failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could significantly harm our business and cause our operating results to sufferOur results of operations are also dependent on our ability to optimize the mix between sales of relatively higher margin but lower volume products and relatively higher volume but lower margin products. In order to improve our margins, sales of higher margin products must in the future represent a greater percentage of our net sales, requiring us to develop, introduce and market new proprietary products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing new proprietary products with the features and functionality that customers in our key markets will demand. DISRUPTION, TERMINATION OR REDUCTION IN THE FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY OUR KEY SUBCONTRACTORS COULD REDUCE OUR SALESWe depend on third party subcontractors in Europe and Asia for manufacturing, assembly and packaging of most of our products. We have entered into a wafer foundry agreement with Infineon Technologies, an outside foundry located in Europe, which currently provides a significant percentage of our wafers. We also rely on an agreement with Team Pacific, a subcontractor in the Philippines, for assembly and packaging of most of our products. Our agreement with Team Pacific extends through January 2003, and requires Team Pacific to assemble all products we send them, based on rolling periodic forecasts. Our agreement with Infineon is for a minimum term of five years from 1999, and requires Infineon to produce increasing quantities of wafers over its term. Disruption or termination of either of these arrangements could harm our business and operating results. Political instability, labor disputes or natural disasters could disrupt the operations of our subcontractors. If any of our subcontractors experience financial, operational, production or quality assurance difficulties resulting in a reduction or interruption in supply to us, our operating results would suffer until alternate subcontractors, if any, become available. Infineon Technologies may not be able to maintain the technological capability to meet our future needs. In addition, our subcontractors also manufacture and package products for our competitors, and there is a risk that our subcontractors could allocate less of their production capacity and resources to our needs. 9 IF OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES BECOME OBSOLETE, OUR MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY WILL BE HARMEDSemiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change, requiring large expenditures for research and development in order to improve product performance and increase manufacturing yields. We cannot assure you that our current process technology will not become obsolete. If we are unable to develop or obtain access to advanced silicon wafer processing technologies as they become needed, our future operating results will suffer. IF WE CANNOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY SUFFEROur success depends on our ability to obtain or maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Our competitors may, however, misappropriate our technology or independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours. We currently hold 17 U.S. patents, eight foreign patents and have six patents pending on semiconductor devices and methods. The first patent on our core technology expires on March 21, 2006. We cannot assure you that any patent owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Moreover, the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and we cannot assure you that our current patents are or any new patents that may be issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or any competitive advantage to us. We may also become subject to or initiate interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, which can demand significant financial and management resources and could harm our financial resultsIn addition, we have licensed a portion of our intellectual property rights to European and Japanese entities and have entered into a joint venture and licensing and technology transfer agreement in China. Intellectual property law and practice differs in foreign jurisdictions, and it may prove difficult for us to protect our rights in certain foreign countries. We cannot assure you that our licensing and other arrangements with foreign entities will not result in infringements on our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, either in the U.S. or abroad, we could face increased competition in the market for our products and technologies, which could negatively affect our sales and ability to expand our business. WE MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN COSTLY AND LENGTHY PATENT INFRINGEMENT OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESSThe semiconductor industry in general is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Protecting our proprietary rights may require us to defend claims of intellectual property infringement by our competitors. If any such infringements arise or are claimed in the future, we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages and may need to obtain licenses from the patent owners, discontinue or change our processes or products or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies. We cannot be certain that licenses would be available under reasonable terms or that we could successfully develop or acquire non-infringing technologies. Moreover, such efforts would likely be time-consuming and divert management attention and resources. Our future involvement in patent infringement or intellectual property litigation could harm our operating results and financial condition. STRONG COMPETITION IN THE POWER SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET MAY REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR THE PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND HARM OUR BUSINESSThe power semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Significant competitive factors in the power semiconductor market include: - product features and performance; 10 - product quality; - product reliability; - technical knowledge; - breadth of product line; - competitive pricing; and - customer service and supportBecause the market for power semiconductors is diverse and highly fragmented, we encounter different competitors in our various product markets. Our principal competitors in one or more of our product areas include International Rectifier, IXYS and ST Microelectronics. Many of our competitors have substantially greater technical, financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do. We expect intensified competition from existing power semiconductor suppliers and the possible entry of new competitors. Increased competition could harm our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not harm our financial condition or our operating results. Competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could harm our business and our financial condition. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WOULD BE HARMED IF WE WERE TO LOSE ONE OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS OR KEY DISTRIBUTORSSeveral of our major customers account for a significant portion of our net sales each year. During 1999, our top five customers accounted for 39.5% of our net sales, and one customer, Advanced Energy Industries accounted for 14.6% of our net sales. If we lost Advanced Energy Industries or one of our other major customers, or if one of them reduced or canceled significant orders, our net income and operating results could be harmed. Richardson Electronics serves as a significant distributor of our products. If this relationship were discontinued, or if Richardson Electronics should fail to provide adequate service to our customers, we could lose sales and our operating results would suffer. IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY, WE MAY LOSE BUSINESS AND EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITABILITYWe have recently experienced rapid revenue growth, and we anticipate continued growth if demand increases in the markets for our products. To manage this growth successfully, we will need to manage increased production requirements, attract, retain and train new employees and management, improve our operational and administrative systems, and manage multiple relationships with customers and suppliers. We may be unable to accomplish any of these requirements, and our failure to do so would harm our operating results. WE MAY ENGAGE IN FUTURE ACQUISITIONS THAT DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND CAUSE US TO INCUR DEBT AND ASSUME CONTINGENT LIABILITIESFrom time to time, we may review acquisition prospects or joint ventures that would complement our current product offering, enhance our design capability or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities. We have no current agreements or formal negotiations underway with respect to any acquisitions. However, we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could: - use a significant portion of our available cash, including the cash proceeds from this offering; - issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders' percentage ownership; - incur substantial debt; or 11 - assume contingent liabilitiesSuch actions by us could harm our operating results and/or the price of our common stock. Acquisitions also entail numerous risks, including: - difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products; - unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or joint venture; - adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers; and - potential loss of key employees of acquired organizationsOur ability to successfully manage these risks would be limited by the small size of our management team. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES In 1999, approximately 43% of our revenues were from sales to customers located outside of the U.S. We are vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, including tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, political and economic instability, currency fluctuations and difficulties in staffing and management of overseas operations. In addition, we have supply agreements, assembly agreements, and other relationships with foreign companies that are subject to similar risks. FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTSOur success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, particularly our development engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, particularly experienced development engineers, systems applications engineers and sales managers. There is intense competition for the services of development engineers in our industry. The loss of the services of one or more of our development engineers, executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could harm our business. We do not currently carry life insurance payable to APT with respect to any of our management employees. OUR PRODUCTS ARE COMPLEX AND COULD CONTAIN DEFECTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS OR RESULT IN CLAIMS AGAINST USWe develop complex and evolving products. Despite testing by us and our customers, defects or other performance problems may be found in existing or new products. This could result in delay in recognition or loss of revenues, loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. These defects may also cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with our customers. Any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses. Even an unsuccessful product liability claim would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend. INTERRUPTIONS IN WAFER PRODUCTION MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTSAny prolonged inability to utilize our Bend, Oregon foundry or the Infineon Technologies foundry as a result of fire, natural disaster or otherwise would harm our financial condition and cause our operating results to suffer. If we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required, our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our sales would likely be reduced. We may not be able to make arrangements for additional foundry capacity in a timely fashion or at all, and such 12 arrangements, if any, may not be on terms favorable to us. Moreover, if we are able to secure additional foundry capacity, we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties. These penalties may be expensive and could harm our operating results. WE DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, AND A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTSWe rely on raw materials to manufacture our products, including silicon, various chemicals, gases and compounds. In particular, we obtain silicon wafers and some packages through limited sources of supply, and in the event of a shortage, we may be forced to locate alternative sources and be forced to pay higher prices. A severe shortage or an increase in the price of silicon wafers or some packages may harm our gross margins and our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis, if at all. OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS INVOLVE HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, AND THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTSOur manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air, water and soil. In the conduct of our manufacturing operations, we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state and local laws. The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated, and if such an accidental release occurs, we could be held financially responsible for clean-up costs and other consequences of the release. In addition, if environmental laws become more stringent over time, or existing laws are more stringently enforced, we could incur greater compliance costs and be subject to increased risks and penalties for violations. We could be held liable for significant damages for violating environmental laws and could lose certain licenses or permits, which could harm our financial results. AN ACCIDENT AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY COULD CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE FOR WHICH WE COULD BE RESPONSIBLEOur manufacturing operations involve high voltage equipment, explosive gases and hazardous chemicals. An accident at our manufacturing facility could result in serious personal injury or property damage for which we could be held financially responsible. Any financial obligation in excess of available insurance could harm our financial results. OUR CHARTER CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT MAY HINDER OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN THE CONTROL OF OUR COMPANYThe authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of APT. These and other provisions in our charter may defer hostile takeovers or delay changes in control or management, which could reduce our stock price. Also, there are provisions of Delaware law that may have similar effects. See "Description of Capital Stock." SIX MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT, AS A GROUP, WILL OWN A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN OUR COMMON STOCK AFTER THIS OFFERINGSix members of our senior management (Messrs. Sireta, Crecraft, Haugen, Hess, Loder and Tsang) will beneficially own approximately 54.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock following the completion of this offering, and 51.6% if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. As a result, these members of management will exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval. The concentrated holdings of management may result in a delay of, or serve as a 13 deterrent to, possible changes in control of APT, which may reduce the market price of our common stock. See "Management" and "Principal and Selling Stockholders." OUR MANAGEMENT WILL HAVE BROAD DISCRETION OVER THE USE OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF THIS OFFERING AND MAY FAIL TO USE SUCH FUNDS EFFECTIVELYWe will repay approximately $8.3 million in debt, plus accrued interest, from the net proceeds of this offering, and the remainder of the net proceeds will be utilized for general corporate purposes, including research and development and possible acquisitions. Consequently, our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Management's allocation of the proceeds of this offering may not benefit the business, and could harm our financial results. FUTURE SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY LOWER OUR STOCK PRICEIf our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock following this offering, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. In addition, the perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of our common stock, regardless of the actual plans of our existing stockholders. Immediately after this offering, approximately 7,914,000 shares of our common stock will be outstanding, or 8,289,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. Of these shares, all of the shares included in this offering will be available for immediate resale in the public market, except those held by our "affiliates." Of the remaining shares outstanding, all but 520 shares are subject to lock-up agreements restricting the sale of such shares for 180 days from the date of this prospectus. However, the underwriters may waive this restriction and allow the stockholders to sell their shares at any time. PURCHASERS IN THIS OFFERING WILL IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION IN PRO FORMA NET TANGIBLE BOOK VALUEThe initial public offering price per share is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our outstanding common stock. Purchasers of shares in this offering will experience immediate dilution in the pro forma net tangible book value of their shares. Based on an initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, dilution per share in this offering will be $10.94 per share (or 72.9% of the price). In addition, we have issued options and warrants to acquire our common stock at prices significantly below the initial public offering price. To the extent these outstanding options and warrants are exercised, there will be further dilution to investors in this offering. See "Dilution." 14</th>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OFFERED BY THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS, THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN EVALUATING AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMMON STOCK. THIS PROSPECTUS CONTAINS CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSEPROJECTED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF ANY NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS. ABSENCE OF COMBINED OPERATING HISTORY; RISKS OF INTEGRATING FOUNDING COMPANIES. Metals USA was founded in 1996 but has conducted no operations and generated no net sales to date. Metals USA has entered into definitive agreements to acquire the Founding Companies simultaneously with, and as a condition to, the closing of this Offering. The Founding Companies have been operating as separate independent entities, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to integrate the operations of these businesses successfully or to institute the necessary systems and procedures, including accounting and financial reporting systems, to manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis. The Company's management group has been assembled only recently, and there can be no assurance that the management group will be able to manage the combined entity or to implement effectively the Company's acquisition and internal growth operating strategies. The pro forma combined historical financial results of the Founding Companies cover periods when theFounding Companies and Metals USA were not under common control or management and may not be indicative of the Company's future financial or operating results. The inability of the Company to integrate the Founding Companies successfully would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations and would make it unlikely that the Company's acquisition program will be successful. See "Business -- Strategy" and "Management." POSSIBLE IMPACT OF VARYING METAL PRICES. The principal raw materials used by the Company are steel, aluminum and various specialty metals. The metals industry as a whole is cyclical, and at times pricing and availability of raw materials in the metals industry can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including general, domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, production levels, competition, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for the Company, and may, therefore, adversely affect the Company's net sales, operating margin and net income. During the last five years, carbon steel prices for the FoundingCompanies have increased an average of 2.7% per year. Aluminum prices have declined approximately 7% per year for the past two years. While the overall trend of steel and aluminum prices has been relatively stable, prices have fluctuated approximately 10% up or down during interim periods. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations." The Company's service centers maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of its customers. Accordingly, the Company purchases metal in an effort to maintain its inventory at levels that it believes to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of its customers based on information derived from customers, market conditions, historic usage and industry research. TheCompany's commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time the Company places its orders. The Company has no long-term, fixed-price purchase contracts. During periods of rising raw materials pricing, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers. When raw material prices decline, customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and, as theCompany uses existing inventory, lower margins. Changing metal prices could adversely affect the Company's operating margin and net income. CYCLICALITY OF DEMAND. Many of the Company's products are sold to industries that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and other factors beyond the control of the Company. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its level of sales in periods of economic stagnation or downturn. 10 RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION STRATEGY. The Company intends to grow significantly through the acquisition of additional value-added metals processors/service centers and manufacturers. The Company expects to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify, acquire or manage profitably additional businesses or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses into the Company without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties. Further, acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results, diversion of management's attention, failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on theCompany's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Founding Companies or other businesses acquired in the future will achieve anticipated net sales and earnings. See "Business -- Strategy." RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITION FINANCING. The timing, size and success of the Company's acquisition efforts and the associated capital commitments cannot be readily predicted. The Company currently intends to finance future acquisitions by using shares of its Common Stock for all or a substantial portion of the consideration to be paid. If the Common Stock does not maintain a sufficient market value, or if potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept Common Stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses, the Company may be required to utilize more of its cash resources, if available, in order to initiate and maintain its acquisition program. Upon consummation of this Offering, the Company will have $13.1 million of net proceeds remaining for future acquisitions and working capital after payment of Merger and Offering expenses and the cash portion of the purchase price for the Founding Companies. If the Company does not have sufficient cash resources, its growth could be limited unless it is able to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financings. Upon consummation of this Offering, the Company has obtained a commitment for a bank line of credit of $150.0 million for working capital and acquisitions. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing it may need for its acquisition program on terms that the Company deems acceptable. See "Use ofProceeds" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Combined liquidity and capital resources." RISKS RELATED TO INTERNAL GROWTH AND OPERATING STRATEGIES. Key elements of the Company's strategy are to improve the profitability of the Founding Companies and subsequently acquired businesses and to continue to expand the net sales of the Founding Companies and any subsequently acquired businesses.Although the Company intends to seek to improve the profitability of the Founding Companies and any subsequently acquired businesses by various means, including realizing overhead and purchasing efficiencies, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to do so. The Company's ability to increase the net sales of the Founding Companies and any subsequently acquired businesses will be affected by various factors, including demand for metals, pricing and availability of raw materials, the Company's ability to expand the range of products and services offered by each Founding Company and any subsequently acquired businesses and the Company's ability to successfully enter new markets. Many of these factors are beyond the control of the Company, and there can be no assurance that the Company's strategies will be successful or that it will be able to generate cash flow adequate for its operations and to support internal growth. A key component of the Company's strategy is to operate the Founding Companies and subsequently acquired businesses on a decentralized basis, with local management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations, profitability and the growth of the business. If proper overall business controls are not implemented, this decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices at the Founding Companies and subsequently acquired businesses and the Company's overall profitability could be adversely affected. See "Business -- Strategy -- Operating on aDecentralized Basis." COMPETITION. The Company is engaged in a highly-fragmented and competitive industry. The Company competes with a large number of other value-added metals processors/service centers on a regional and local basis, some of which may have greater financial resources than the Company and several of which are public companies. The Company also competes to a lesser extent with primary metals 11 producers, who typically sell to very large customers requiring regular shipments of large volumes of metals. The Company may also face competition for acquisition candidates from those public companies that have acquired a number of metals service center businesses during the past decade. Other smaller metals processors/service centers may also seek acquisitions from time to time.Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net sales and profitability. See "Business -- Competition." REGULATION. The Company's operations are subject to a number of federal, state and local regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to workplace health and safety. In particular, the Company's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing waste disposal, air and water emissions, the handling of hazardous substances, environment protection, remediation, workplace exposure and other matters.Hazardous materials the Company uses in its operations primarily include lubricants, cleaning solvents and hydrochloric acid used in its pickling operations at two facilities. Some of the properties owned or leased by the Company are located in industrial areas close to properties with histories of heavy industrial use, three of which are on or near sites listed on the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA") National Priority List. The Company believes that as many as three of the properties leased by Founding Companies have been contaminated by pollutants which have migrated from neighboring facilities or have been deposited by prior occupants. Prior to entering into the agreements relating to the Mergers, the Company evaluated the properties owned or leased by the Founding Companies and engaged an independent environmental consulting firm to conduct or review assessments of environmental conditions at these properties. Although no environmental claims have been made against the Company and it has not been named as a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or any other party, it is possible that the Company could be identified by the Environmental ProtectionAgency, a state agency or one or more third parties as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or under analogous state laws. If so, the Company could incur substantial litigation costs to prove it is not responsible for the environmental damage. The Company has obtained limited indemnities from the stockholders of the Founding Companies (ranging from approximately $50,000 to $7.6 million per Founding Company) whose facilities are located at the contaminated sites. The Company believes that these indemnities will be adequate to protect it from a material adverse effect on its financial condition should the Company be found to be responsible for a share of the clean-up costs. The limited indemnities are subject to certain deductible amounts, however, and there can be no assurance that the limited indemnities will fully protect theCompany. See "Business -- Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters." RELIANCE ON KEY PERSONNEL. Due in part to the Company's decentralized operating strategy, the Company will be highly dependent on the continuing efforts of its executive officers and the senior management of the Founding Companies, and the Company likely will depend on the senior management of any significant business it acquires in the future. The business or prospects of theCompany could be affected adversely if any of these persons does not continue in his management role until the Company is able to attract and retain qualified replacements. See "Management." CONTROL BY EXISTING MANAGEMENT AND STOCKHOLDERS. Following the consummation of the Mergers and this Offering, the Company's executive officers and directors, former stockholders of the Founding Companies and entities affiliated with them will beneficially own approximately 71.6% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (68.7% if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), of which Notre, management of and consultants toMetals USA will own 4,753,414 shares of Common Stock, representing 22.9% of all shares of Common Stock outstanding, for which they paid $.01 per share. Of these shares of Common Stock, 3,122,914 shares are Restricted Common Stock, which are entitled to elect one member of the Company's Board of Directors and to 0.55 of one vote for each share held on all other matters on which they are entitled to vote. Holders of Restricted Common Stock are not entitled to vote on the election of any other directors. These holders of Common Stock will control in the aggregate 17.3% of 12 the votes of all shares of Common Stock, and, if acting in concert, will be able to exercise control over the Company's affairs, to elect the entire Board ofDirectors and to control the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders. See "Principal Stockholders." SUBSTANTIAL PROCEEDS OF OFFERING PAYABLE TO AFFILIATES OF FOUNDING COMPANIES. Of the net proceeds of this Offering, $27.8 million, or 54.7% will be paid as the cash portion of the purchase price for the Founding Companies.Certain of the Founding Companies have incurred indebtedness which has been personally guaranteed by their stockholders or by entities controlled by its stockholders. Some of the recipients of these funds will become directors of the Company or holders of more than 5% of the Common Stock. At March 31, 1997, the aggregate amount of indebtedness of these Founding Companies that was subject to personal guarantees was approximately $40.7 million. After March 31, 1997, theFounding Companies borrowed $18.6 million to fund the S Corporation Distributions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this Offering, together with borrowings available from the Company's revolving credit facility (see "Use of Proceeds"), to repay substantially all of the indebtedness of the Founding Companies. Additionally, Notre has agreed to advance to Metals USA until the consummation of the Mergers and the Offering such funds as are necessary to effect the Mergers and this Offering and will be reimbursed from the proceeds of this Offering in respect of such expenses. As of March 31, 1997,Notre had advanced the Company $1.1 million for such expenses. In 1997, 985,500 shares of Common Stock have been issued to management and certain consultants to the Company at a price of $0.01 per share. See "Certain Transactions." BENEFITS TO NOTRE AND MANAGEMENT. Notre, management and certain consultants to the Company own in the aggregate 4,753,414 shares of CommonStock. These stockholders acquired their Common Stock at a price of $0.01 per share. These parties will own, in the aggregate, appproximately 22.9% of the outstanding Common Stock following the consummation of this Offering, which have a value of approximately $47.5 million. Of these shares of Common Stock, 3,122,914 shares are Restricted Common Stock, which are entitled to elect one member of the Company's Board of Directors and to 0.55 of one vote for each share held on all other matters on which they are entitled to vote. Holders ofRestricted Common Stock are not entitled to vote on the election of any other directors and will control in the aggregate 8.9% of the votes of all shares of Common Stock. See "Principal Stockholders." NO PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET AND DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE. Prior to this Offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock. Therefore, the initial public offering price for the Common Stock was determined by negotiation between the Company and the Representatives of the Underwriters and may bear no relationship to the price at which the Common Stock will trade after theOffering. See "Underwriting" for the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price. The Common Stock has been approved for quotation on The New York Stock Exchange. However, there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop subsequent to this Offering or, if developed, that it will be sustained. After this Offering, the market price of the CommonStock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including the timing of any acquisitions by the Company, variations in the Company's annual or quarterly financial results or those of its competitors, changes by financial research analysts in their estimates of the future earnings of the Company, conditions in the economy in general or in the Company's industry in particular, unfavorable publicity or changes in applicable laws and regulations (or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof) affecting the Company or the metals industry. From time to time, the stock market experiences significant price and volume volatility, which may affect the market price of the Common Stock for reasons unrelated to the Company's performance. POTENTIAL EFFECT OF SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE ON PRICE OF COMMONSTOCK. Upon consummation of the Mergers and this Offering, 20,782,023 shares of Common Stock will be outstanding. The 5,900,000 shares sold in this Offering (other than shares that may be purchased by affiliates of the Company) will be freely tradable. The remaining outstanding shares may be resold publicly only following their registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or pursuant to an available exemption from registration (such as provided by Rule 144 following a one year holding period for previously unregistered shares). The holders of these remaining shares have certain demand rights to have their shares 13 registered in the future under the Securities Act, but may not exercise such demand registration rights, and have agreed with the Company that they will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of their shares, for one year following the consummation of this Offering. On completion of this Offering, theCompany also will have outstanding options to purchase up to a total of 2,171,024 shares of Common Stock. The Company intends to register all the shares subject to these options under the Securities Act for public resale. The Company intends to register 8,000,000 additional shares of Common Stock under the Securities Act within 90 days after completion of this Offering for issuance in connection with future acquisitions. These shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance by persons not affiliated with the Company unless the Company contractually restricts their resale. Sales, or the availability for sale of, substantial amounts of the Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices and the future ability of the Company to raise equity capital and complete any additional acquisitions for CommonStock. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." POSSIBLE ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECT OF CERTAIN CHARTER PROVISIONS. Metals USA's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") authorizes the Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, one or more series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights (including preferences over the Common Stock respecting dividends and distributions and voting rights) as the Board of Directors may determine. The issuance of this "blank-check" preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. In addition, the Certificate of Incorporation provides for a classified Board of Directors, which may also have the effect of inhibiting or delaying a change in control of the Company. Certain provisions of the DelawareGeneral Corporation Law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by the Board of Directors. See "Description of Capital Stock." IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION. Purchasers of Common Stock in this Offering will experience immediate, substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of their stock of $7.76 per share and may experience further dilution in that value from issuances of Common Stock in connection with future acquisitions.

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS This offering involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks before you decide to buy our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business Because we have a short operating history, there is a limited amount of information about us upon which you can evaluate our business and potential for future successWe were incorporated in October 1996 and have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. You must consider the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets, such as the market for Internet professional services. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks and uncertainties, our ability to execute our business plan would be materially and adversely affected. We had an accumulated deficit of $8.3 million as of September 30, 1999, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable futureWe have had substantial losses since our inception and our operating losses may continue and even increase in the future. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly, especially in the areas of sales, marketing and recruiting, and, as a result, we will need to generate increased quarterly revenues to become profitable. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will ever become or remain profitable. If our revenues fail to grow at anticipated rates or our operating expenses increase without a commensurate increase in our revenues, our financial condition will be adversely affected. It is unlikely that the growth rates we have experienced in recent periods will continue at their current levels. Our inability to become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter in future periods, and, as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of our investors and analysts, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate or declineOur revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and could fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include: . demand for our services; . our ability to attract and retain clients; . our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; . the number, timing and significance of new services introduced by our competitors; . our ability to develop, market and introduce new and enhanced services on a timely basis; . the level of service and price competition; . changes in operating expenses; and . changes in the mix of services offered. Our operating expenses are relatively fixed A substantial portion of our operating expense is related to personnel costs, marketing programs and overhead, which cannot be adjusted quickly and are therefore relatively fixed in the short term. Our operating expense levels are based, in significant part, on our expectations of future revenue. If actual revenues are below our expectations, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. 8Period-to-period comparisons may be unreliable Due to all of the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed in this prospectus, you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this event, the market price of our common stock is likely to fall. Our success depends on a limited number of significant clients, and our revenues could be negatively affected by the loss of a major client or significant projectWe generate much of our revenues from a limited number of clients. As a result, if we lose a major client or large project, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In 1998, for example, our three largest clients, Chevron, Johnstone Supply and Toyota, accounted for approximately 51% of our total net revenues. During the nine months ended September 30, 1999, our three largest professional services clients, Allmerica, Chevron and U.S. West, collectively accounted for approximately 54% of our total net revenues. In addition, a fourth client, CEE, for whom we perform educational services, accounted for 18% of our total net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 1999We perform varying amounts of work for specific clients from year to year. A major client in one year may not use our services in another year. In addition, we may derive revenues from a major client that constitutes a large portion of a particular quarter's total revenues. If we lose any major clients or any of our clients cancel or significantly reduce a large project's scope, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we expect the size of these contracts to grow, resulting in a continued dependence on significant clients. Also, if we fail to collect a large account receivable, we could be subjected to significant financial exposure. Our lack of long-term client contracts reduces the predictability of our revenues because these contracts may be canceled on short notice and without penaltyOur clients generally retain us on a project-by-project basis, rather than under long-term contracts. As a result, a client may not engage us for further services once a project is completed. Also, most of our clients can reduce or cancel their contracts with little or no notice and without penalty. If a significant client, or a number of clients, terminate, significantly reduce or modify their contracts with us, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Consequently, you should not predict or anticipate our future revenues based on the number of clients we have or the number and size of our existing projects. When a client postpones, modifies or cancels a project, we must shift our consultants to other projects to minimize the adverse impact on our operating results. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in efficiently shifting our consultants to new projects in the event of project terminations. We may lose money on fixed-price contractsAs part of our strategy, we intend to enter into more fixed-price contracts, rather than contracts based on payment for time and materials. For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 12% of our professional services revenues. In addition, the average size of our contracts has increased in recent periods, which increases our exposure to the financial risks of fixed-price contracts. We assume greater financial risk on fixed-price contracts than on time-and-materials engagements, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully price our larger contracts. We have only a limited history in estimating our costs for our engagements, particularly for larger projects. In the past, we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete certain projects, resulting in lower gross margins on these projects. We may experience similar situations in the future. If we fail to estimate accurately the resources and time required for an engagement, to manage client expectations effectively or to complete fixed- price engagements within our budget, on time and to our clients' satisfaction, we would be exposed to cost overruns, potentially leading to losses on these engagements. 9 We depend on our key personnel, and the loss of any key personnel could disrupt our operations, adversely affect our business and result in reduced revenuesOur future success will depend on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and other key employees, in particular the services of: . Joseph M. Bellini, our President and Chief Executive Officer; . Richard C. Putz, our Executive Vice President, Worldwide Industries; . R. Jeffrey Spurrier, our Executive Vice President, Worldwide Operations; . Mark A. Cosway, our Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; . Donald W. Amaya, our Executive Vice President, Human Resources; and . Richard O. Wester, our Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThe loss of the services of any of these individuals could seriously impair our ability to execute our business plan, which could reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to hire, train and retain qualified employees is crucial to our ability to compete effectivelyTo succeed, we must hire, train, motivate, retain and successfully manage employees with skills related to the Internet and its rapidly changing technologies. Because of the recent and rapid growth of the Internet, professionals who have Internet expertise and can perform the services we offer are scarce, and competition for these individuals is intense. We might not be able to hire enough experienced professionals or to train, motivate, retain and successfully manage the employees we do hire. This could hinder our ability to complete existing projects and bid for new projects. In addition, because the competition for qualified professionals in the Internet industry is intense, hiring, training, motivating and retaining professionals with the strategic, technical and creative skills we need is both time-consuming and expensive. While our key employees are subject to non-competition agreements, these agreements may be difficult to enforce. As a result, our employees may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own companies in competition with us. If we fail to attract, train and retain key personnel, our business would be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to successfully manage our growth which could adversely affect our businessWe have grown rapidly and expect to continue to grow rapidly, both by hiring new employees and serving new industry and geographic markets. Our recent growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our management and our operating and financial systems. Our headcount has grown from 57 as of December 31, 1997 to 183 as of September 30, 1999, and several members of our senior management team have only recently joined us. We do not believe our recent growth rate is sustainable for the long termOur personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations. In order to accommodate the increased number of projects, clients and the increased size of our operations, we will need to hire, train and retain appropriate personnel to manage our operations. We will also need to improve our financial and management controls, reporting systems and operating systems. We currently plan to redesign several internal systems, including our recruiting and engagement management systems. We may encounter difficulties in developing and implementing these new systems. Historically, we have depended on third-party educational seminars to generate a substantial majority of our client engagements, and the success of our business will depend on our ability to develop effective sales and marketing capabilitiesHistorically, we have derived a substantial majority of our client engagements from sales leads generated by educational seminars produced in conjunction with CEE and Professor John J. Donovan. In the event that 10 either CEE or Professor Donovan is no longer able to perform these services, our revenues could be adversely affected. While these seminars will continue to be an important source of sales leads for client engagements, we have begun to develop our own sales and marketing capabilities as well. However, there is intense competition for sales personnel in our business, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting, integrating, motivating and retaining new sales personnel. In addition, we have limited experience in marketing our services with a direct sales force. Unlike our educational seminars, our direct sales force may be unable to establish client contacts at senior management levels, which may limit the effectiveness of those contacts and limit future revenue growth. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the Internet's rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards and changing client requirementsThe market for Internet professional services is relatively new and evolving rapidly. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to provide services that are accepted by our existing and future clients as an integral part of their business model. Demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services are subject to a high level of uncertainty. The level of demand for Internet professional services will depend upon a number of factors, including the following: . the growth in consumer access to, and acceptance of, new interactive technologies such as the Internet; . the adoption of Internet-based business models; and . the development of technologies that facilitate two-way communication between companies and targeted audiencesSignificant issues concerning the commercial use of Internet technologies, including security, reliability, cost, ease of use and quality of service, remain unresolved and may inhibit the growth of eBusiness solutions that utilize these technologies. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to meet these challenges, which must be met in a timely and cost- effective manner. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in effectively meeting these challenges, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our businessIndustry analysts and others have made many predictions concerning the growth of the Internet as a business medium. Many of these historical predictions have overstated the growth of the Internet. These predictions should not be relied upon as conclusive. The market for our services may not develop, our services may not be adopted and individual personal computer users in business or at home may not use the Internet or other interactive media for commerce and communication. If the market for Internet professional services fails to develop, or develops more slowly than expected, or if our services do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Future acquisitions or investments could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our businessWe anticipate that a portion of any future growth may be accomplished by acquiring existing businesses. The success of any acquisitions will depend upon, among other things, our ability to integrate acquired personnel, operations, products and technologies into our organization effectively, to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers of acquired firms. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations. In addition, as a public company, it may be more difficult to acquire additional companies and the cost of acquiring businesses may increase relative to the cost of similar acquisitions when we were a private company. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Any future acquisitions would involve certain other risks, including the assumption of additional liabilities, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and diversion of management's attention from other 11 business concerns. Furthermore, we may issue equity securities or incur debt to pay for any future acquisitions. If we issue equity securities, your percentage ownership of our company would be reduced. Competition in the Internet professional services market is intense, and therefore we may lose projects to our competitors or prospective clients' internal IT departmentsWhile the market for Internet professional services is relatively new, it is already highly competitive. In many cases we compete with the in-house technical staff of our prospective clients. In addition, the market is characterized by an increasing number of entrants that have introduced or developed services similar to those offered by us. We believe that competition will intensify and increase in the future. Our target market is rapidly evolving and is subject to continuous technological change. As a result, our competitors may be better positioned to address these developments or may react more favorably to these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Existing or future competitors may develop or offer Internet professional services that provide significant technological, creative, performance, price or other advantages over the services we offer. There are many competitors in the market for Internet professional services We currently compete for client assignments and experienced personnel principally with the following: . Internet service firms: AGENCY.COM, iXL, Modem Media.Poppe Tyson, Online Marketing Communications, Organic Online, Proxicom, Razorfish, Scient, USWeb/CKS and Viant. . Systems integrators: Andersen Consulting, Cambridge Technology Partners, Cap Gemini, EDS, Sapient and WM-Data. . Management consulting firms: Bain, Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey. . Computer hardware and service vendors: Compaq, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and IBM. . Advertising agencies: Bates, DDB Needham, Grey Advertising, McCann- Erickson and Ogilvy & MatherMany of these businesses have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and managerial resources than we do. There are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. We have no patented or other proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the Internet professional services market. Therefore, we must rely on the skill of our personnel and the quality of our client service. The costs to develop and provide Internet professional services are low. We expect that we will continue to face additional competition from new entrants into the market in the future, and we are subject to the risk that our employees may leave us and may start competing businesses. Any one or more of these factors could hurt our business. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our businessOur future success will depend, in part, upon our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect these rights. We do not have any patents or patent applications pending. Existing trade secret and copyright laws afford us only limited protection. Third parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our solutions or technologies. This is particularly true in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Others may independently develop and obtain patents or copyrights for technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. If that happens, we may need to license these technologies and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in any future intellectual property litigation we may be forced to do one or more of the following: . cease selling or using technology or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 12 . obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to use the relevant technology; . configure services to avoid infringement; and . refund license fees or other payments that we have previously receivedGenerally, we develop software applications for specific client engagements. Issues relating to ownership of and rights to use software applications and frameworks can be complicated. We may become involved in disputes that affect our ability to resell or reuse these applications and frameworks. Also, we may have to pay economic damages in these disputes which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Difficulties in transitioning to new software systems may negatively affect our businessWe currently use PC and network-based software for our management systems. Our current financial software is designed for small to medium-sized companies. Our human resources, recruiting and resource management systems are mainly database and spreadsheet driven. We have purchased and are currently planning to implement Oracle's integrated financial, human resources and project software. We are also evaluating our recruiting and customer relationship management systems. However, these new systems are expensive, and we may encounter difficulties in transitioning to them. Difficulties encountered with developing, implementing or operating such systems could materially and adversely affect our business. Our failure to meet client expectations or deliver error-free services could result in losses and negative publicityOur client engagements involve the creation, implementation and maintenance of eBusiness solutions that are often critical to our clients' businesses. Any defects or errors in these applications or a failure to meet client expectations could result in: . delayed or lost revenues due to adverse client reaction; . the provision of additional services to a client at no charge; . negative publicity regarding us and our services, which could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients; and . claims for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for any damagesOur contracts generally contain provisions intended to limit our liability for damages that may arise from negligent acts, errors, mistakes or omissions in rendering services to our clients. However, we cannot assure you that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages. Furthermore, our general liability insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or be sufficient to cover large claims. In addition, the insurer may disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of any large claim against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. Problems relating to the "Year 2000 Issue" could adversely affect our businessYear 2000 issues may adversely affect our business and our clients' businesses. Many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two-digit year entries in the date code field. Consequently, on January 1, 2000, many of these systems could fail or malfunction because they may not be able to distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates. As a result, computer systems and software used by many companies, including us, our clients and our prospective clients, may need to be upgraded to comply with such "Year 2000" requirements. Any failure on the part of our principal internal systems, the systems that we create for our prospective clients and other existing systems of our clients, could seriously harm our business, financial condition and operating results. For a more detailed description of our Year 2000 assessment, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Impact of Year 2000." 13 To remain competitive, we may need additional financing, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at allWe expect the net proceeds from this offering, together with current cash and available borrowings under our credit facilities, will be sufficient for us to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need additional financing sooner if we: . decide to expand faster than planned; . develop new or enhanced services or products ahead of schedule; . need to respond to competitive pressures; or . decide to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologiesIf we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your percentage ownership will be reduced. In addition, these transactions may dilute the value of our common stock. We may have to issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If future financing is not available or is not available on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to fund our business plan which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our international expansion plans may not succeedA key element of our strategy is to expand our operations into international markets. We currently have professionals operating in London, England and Sydney, Australia. We have limited experience in marketing, selling and delivering our services internationally, and we may have difficulty in managing our international operations because of distance, as well as language and cultural differences. We cannot assure you that we will be able to market and deliver our services successfully in foreign marketsOther risks related to our international operations include: . fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the conversion to the euro by all members of the European Union by year-end 2003; . difficulties arising from staffing and managing foreign operations; . longer payment cycles; . restrictions and the reduced protection of intellectual property; . restrictions on the import and export of sensitive U.S. technologies, such as data security and encryption technologies that we may wish to use in solutions we develop for customers; . legal and regulatory requirements of different countries, such as differing tax or labor laws; and . potential political and economic instabilityIf any of these risks materialize, we may have difficulty in managing our international operations and expansion. Risks Related to the Internet Professional Services Industry Our future success will depend on the continued growth and development of the Internet and its infrastructure Our future success will depend on the continued growth and use of the Internet. We cannot assure you that this growth will continue or that a sufficient number of consumers will adopt and continue to use the Internet. Internet usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons, including: . inadequate Internet infrastructure; 14 . security concerns; . inconsistent quality of service; or . unavailability of cost-effective, high-speed access servicesWe cannot assure you that the Internet infrastructure will be able to support expected growth or that the performance and reliability of the Internet will not decline as a result of this growth. Recently, many web sites, including those of our clients, have experienced a variety of interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the Internet network infrastructure. If these outages or delays frequently occur in the future, web usage could grow more slowly than anticipated or decline. Our future success will depend on the development of the eBusiness market, which remains uncertainOur future success will depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the Internet as an effective medium of commerce by businesses and consumers. Rapid growth in the use of the Internet and commercial online services is a recent phenomenon. Demand for recently introduced services and products over the Internet and online services is subject to a high level of uncertainty. The continued development of the Internet and eBusiness as a viable commercial marketplace is subject to a number of factors, including the following: . the willingness of buyers to shift their purchasing habits from traditional vendors to eBusiness vendors; . insufficient availability of telecommunications services providing sufficiently fast response times; and . adverse publicity and consumer concern about the security of eBusiness transactions. Breaches of security and computer viruses on the Internet may adversely affect our business by slowing the growth of eBusinessThe need to securely transmit confidential information, such as credit card and other personal information, over the Internet has been a significant barrier to eBusiness and Internet communications. Any well-publicized compromise of security could deter consumers and businesses from using the Internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information, such as purchases of goods or services. Furthermore, computer viruses that spread over the Internet could disable or damage the systems we develop for our clients. Decreased Internet traffic or eBusiness sales as a result of general security concerns or viruses could cause companies to reduce their amount of technology spending, which could hurt our results of operations. We face risks associated with government regulation of, and legal uncertainties surrounding, the InternetAny new law or regulation pertaining to the Internet, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, could increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications, commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent. The laws governing the Internet, however, remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws governing intellectual property, copyright, privacy, obscenity, libel and taxation apply to the Internet. In addition, the growth and development of eBusiness may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad. 15 Risks Associated With This Offering The future sale of substantial amounts of our common stock may negatively affect our stock priceThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of shares of common stock in the market after this offering, or the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, we have a significant number of shares that are subject to outstanding options and warrants. The exercise of these options and warrants and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock could cause a further decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. For a more detailed description of the number of shares that may be sold following this offering, see "Shares Eligible for Future Sale" on page 61. The future issuance of preferred stock may dilute the rights of our common stockholdersFollowing this offering, our board of directors will have the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, privileges and other terms of the shares. The board of directors may exercise this authority without any further approval of the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. We have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attemptsCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that you as a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include: . authorizing the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a hostile takeover attempt; . prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which will allow a majority of stockholders to control the election of all directors; . requiring super-majority voting to effect certain amendments to our ce</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS AND OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE PURCHASING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS VERY CYCLICAL, AND AN INDUSTRY DOWNTURN WOULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES The semiconductor industry is characterized by: - rapid technological change; - cyclical market patterns; - significant price erosion; - periods of over-capacity and production shortages; - variations in manufacturing costs and yields; and - significant expenditures for capital equipment and product developmentThe semiconductor industry has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions. In the past, business conditions in this industry have rapidly changed from periods of strong demand to periods of weak demand. Any future downturn in the industry could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. We cannot assure you that we will not experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions or other factors. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND EXPECT THESE FLUCTUATIONS TO CONTINUE, WHICH MAY CAUSE OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE TO DECLINEOur quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect our net sales, gross margins and operating results. These factors include: - the volume and timing of orders received; - market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers; - competitive pricing pressures; - our ability to expand manufacturing output to meet increasing demand; - the timing and extent of our research and development expenses; and - fluctuations in manufacturing yieldsHistorically in the semiconductor industry, average selling prices of products have decreased over time. If we are unable to introduce new proprietary products with higher margins or reduce manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our existing products, then our operating results will be harmed. Our business is characterized by short-term orders and shipment schedules, and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer. Because most of our backlog is cancelable without penalty, we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. In addition, because of fixed costs in the semiconductor industry, we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls. As a result of the foregoing factors, or the other risk factors discussed in this prospectus, we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in future periods. 8 IF WE CANNOT INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY SUFFERThe markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions. Our success depends upon our ability to develop improved power semiconductors for new and existing markets, to introduce these products in a timely manner, and to have these products gain market acceptance. The development of new power semiconductors is highly complex and from time to time we have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products. Successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors, including: - proper new product definition; - timely completion of design and testing of new products; - achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields; and - market acceptance of our products and the products of our customersWe cannot assure you we will be able to meet these challenges or adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost-effectively as necessary to compete successfully. Due to the complexity and variety of power semiconductors, the limited number of qualified development engineers and the limited effectiveness of computer-aided design systems in the design of such circuits, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that any products introduced by us will be adopted by existing or potential customers, or that any products initially accepted by our customers will become industry standard products. Our failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could significantly harm our business and cause our operating results to sufferOur results of operations are also dependent on our ability to optimize the mix between sales of relatively higher margin but lower volume products and relatively higher volume but lower margin products. In order to improve our margins, sales of higher margin products must in the future represent a greater percentage of our net sales, requiring us to develop, introduce and market new proprietary products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing new proprietary products with the features and functionality that customers in our key markets will demand. DISRUPTION, TERMINATION OR REDUCTION IN THE FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY OUR KEY SUBCONTRACTORS COULD REDUCE OUR SALESWe depend on third party subcontractors in Europe and Asia for manufacturing, assembly and packaging of most of our products. We have entered into a wafer foundry agreement with Infineon Technologies, an outside foundry located in Europe, which currently provides a significant percentage of our wafers. We also rely on an agreement with Team Pacific, a subcontractor in the Philippines, for assembly and packaging of most of our products. Our agreement with Team Pacific extends through January 2003, and requires Team Pacific to assemble all products we send them, based on rolling periodic forecasts. Our agreement with Infineon is for a minimum term of five years from 1999, and requires Infineon to produce increasing quantities of wafers over its term. Disruption or termination of either of these arrangements could harm our business and operating results. Political instability, labor disputes or natural disasters could disrupt the operations of our subcontractors. If any of our subcontractors experience financial, operational, production or quality assurance difficulties resulting in a reduction or interruption in supply to us, our operating results would suffer until alternate subcontractors, if any, become available. Infineon Technologies may not be able to maintain the technological capability to meet our future needs. In addition, our subcontractors also manufacture and package products for our competitors, and there is a risk that our subcontractors could allocate less of their production capacity and resources to our needs. 9 IF OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES BECOME OBSOLETE, OUR MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY WILL BE HARMEDSemiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change, requiring large expenditures for research and development in order to improve product performance and increase manufacturing yields. We cannot assure you that our current process technology will not become obsolete. If we are unable to develop or obtain access to advanced silicon wafer processing technologies as they become needed, our future operating results will suffer. IF WE CANNOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY SUFFEROur success depends on our ability to obtain or maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Our competitors may, however, misappropriate our technology or independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours. We currently hold 17 U.S. patents, eight foreign patents and have six patents pending on semiconductor devices and methods. The first patent on our core technology expires on March 21, 2006. We cannot assure you that any patent owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Moreover, the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and we cannot assure you that our current patents are or any new patents that may be issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or any competitive advantage to us. We may also become subject to or initiate interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, which can demand significant financial and management resources and could harm our financial resultsIn addition, we have licensed a portion of our intellectual property rights to European and Japanese entities and have entered into a joint venture and licensing and technology transfer agreement in China. Intellectual property law and practice differs in foreign jurisdictions, and it may prove difficult for us to protect our rights in certain foreign countries. We cannot assure you that our licensing and other arrangements with foreign entities will not result in infringements on our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, either in the U.S. or abroad, we could face increased competition in the market for our products and technologies, which could negatively affect our sales and ability to expand our business. WE MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN COSTLY AND LENGTHY PATENT INFRINGEMENT OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESSThe semiconductor industry in general is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Protecting our proprietary rights may require us to defend claims of intellectual property infringement by our competitors. If any such infringements arise or are claimed in the future, we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages and may need to obtain licenses from the patent owners, discontinue or change our processes or products or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies. We cannot be certain that licenses would be available under reasonable terms or that we could successfully develop or acquire non-infringing technologies. Moreover, such efforts would likely be time-consuming and divert management attention and resources. Our future involvement in patent infringement or intellectual property litigation could harm our operating results and financial condition. STRONG COMPETITION IN THE POWER SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET MAY REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR THE PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND HARM OUR BUSINESSThe power semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Significant competitive factors in the power semiconductor market include: - product features and performance; 10 - product quality; - product reliability; - technical knowledge; - breadth of product line; - competitive pricing; and - customer service and supportBecause the market for power semiconductors is diverse and highly fragmented, we encounter different competitors in our various product markets. Our principal competitors in one or more of our product areas include International Rectifier, IXYS and ST Microelectronics. Many of our competitors have substantially greater technical, financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do. We expect intensified competition from existing power semiconductor suppliers and the possible entry of new competitors. Increased competition could harm our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not harm our financial condition or our operating results. Competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could harm our business and our financial condition. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WOULD BE HARMED IF WE WERE TO LOSE ONE OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS OR KEY DISTRIBUTORSSeveral of our major customers account for a significant portion of our net sales each year. During 1999, our top five customers accounted for 39.5% of our net sales, and one customer, Advanced Energy Industries accounted for 14.6% of our net sales. If we lost Advanced Energy Industries or one of our other major customers, or if one of them reduced or canceled significant orders, our net income and operating results could be harmed. Richardson Electronics serves as a significant distributor of our products. If this relationship were discontinued, or if Richardson Electronics should fail to provide adequate service to our customers, we could lose sales and our operating results would suffer. IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY, WE MAY LOSE BUSINESS AND EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITABILITYWe have recently experienced rapid revenue growth, and we anticipate continued growth if demand increases in the markets for our products. To manage this growth successfully, we will need to manage increased production requirements, attract, retain and train new employees and management, improve our operational and administrative systems, and manage multiple relationships with customers and suppliers. We may be unable to accomplish any of these requirements, and our failure to do so would harm our operating results. WE MAY ENGAGE IN FUTURE ACQUISITIONS THAT DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND CAUSE US TO INCUR DEBT AND ASSUME CONTINGENT LIABILITIESFrom time to time, we may review acquisition prospects or joint ventures that would complement our current product offering, enhance our design capability or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities. We have no current agreements or formal negotiations underway with respect to any acquisitions. However, we may acquire businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we could: - use a significant portion of our available cash, including the cash proceeds from this offering; - issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders' percentage ownership; - incur substantial debt; or 11 - assume contingent liabilitiesSuch actions by us could harm our operating results and/or the price of our common stock. Acquisitions also entail numerous risks, including: - difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products; - unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or joint venture; - adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers; and - potential loss of key employees of acquired organizationsOur ability to successfully manage these risks would be limited by the small size of our management team. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES In 1999, approximately 43% of our revenues were from sales to customers located outside of the U.S. We are vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, including tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, political and economic instability, currency fluctuations and difficulties in staffing and management of overseas operations. In addition, we have supply agreements, assembly agreements, and other relationships with foreign companies that are subject to similar risks. FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTSOur success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, particularly our development engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, particularly experienced development engineers, systems applications engineers and sales managers. There is intense competition for the services of development engineers in our industry. The loss of the services of one or more of our development engineers, executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could harm our business. We do not currently carry life insurance payable to APT with respect to any of our management employees. OUR PRODUCTS ARE COMPLEX AND COULD CONTAIN DEFECTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS OR RESULT IN CLAIMS AGAINST USWe develop complex and evolving products. Despite testing by us and our customers, defects or other performance problems may be found in existing or new products. This could result in delay in recognition or loss of revenues, loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. These defects may also cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with our customers. Any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses. Even an unsuccessful product liability claim would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend. INTERRUPTIONS IN WAFER PRODUCTION MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTSAny prolonged inability to utilize our Bend, Oregon foundry or the Infineon Technologies foundry as a result of fire, natural disaster or otherwise would harm our financial condition and cause our operating results to suffer. If we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required, our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our sales would likely be reduced. We may not be able to make arrangements for additional foundry capacity in a timely fashion or at all, and such 12 arrangements, if any, may not be on terms favorable to us. Moreover, if we are able to secure additional foundry capacity, we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties. These penalties may be expensive and could harm our operating results. WE DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, AND A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTSWe rely on raw materials to manufacture our products, including silicon, various chemicals, gases and compounds. In particular, we obtain silicon wafers and some packages through limited sources of supply, and in the event of a shortage, we may be forced to locate alternative sources and be forced to pay higher prices. A severe shortage or an increase in the price of silicon wafers or some packages may harm our gross margins and our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis, if at all. OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS INVOLVE HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, AND THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTSOur manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air, water and soil. In the conduct of our manufacturing operations, we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state and local laws. The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated, and if such an accidental release occurs, we could be held financially responsible for clean-up costs and other consequences of the release. In addition, if environmental laws become more stringent over time, or existing laws are more stringently enforced, we could incur greater compliance costs and be subject to increased risks and penalties for violations. We could be held liable for significant damages for violating environmental laws and could lose certain licenses or permits, which could harm our financial results. AN ACCIDENT AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY COULD CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE FOR WHICH WE COULD BE RESPONSIBLEOur manufacturing operations involve high voltage equipment, explosive gases and hazardous chemicals. An accident at our manufacturing facility could result in serious personal injury or property damage for which we could be held financially responsible. Any financial obligation in excess of available insurance could harm our financial results. OUR CHARTER CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT MAY HINDER OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN THE CONTROL OF OUR COMPANYThe authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of APT. These and other provisions in our charter may defer hostile takeovers or delay changes in control or management, which could reduce our stock price. Also, there are provisions of Delaware law that may have similar effects. See "Description of Capital Stock." SIX MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT, AS A GROUP, WILL OWN A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN OUR COMMON STOCK AFTER THIS OFFERINGSix members of our senior management (Messrs. Sireta, Crecraft, Haugen, Hess, Loder and Tsang) will beneficially own approximately 54.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock following the completion of this offering, and 51.6% if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. As a result, these members of management will exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval. The concentrated holdings of management may result in a delay of, or serve as a 13 deterrent to, possible changes in control of APT, which may reduce the market price of our common stock. See "Management" and "Principal and Selling Stockholders." OUR MANAGEMENT WILL HAVE BROAD DISCRETION OVER THE USE OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF THIS OFFERING AND MAY FAIL TO USE SUCH FUNDS EFFECTIVELYWe will repay approximately $8.3 million in debt, plus accrued interest, from the net proceeds of this offering, and the remainder of the net proceeds will be utilized for general corporate purposes, including research and development and possible acquisitions. Consequently, our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Management's allocation of the proceeds of this offering may not benefit the business, and could harm our financial results. FUTURE SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY LOWER OUR STOCK PRICEIf our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock following this offering, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. In addition, the perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of our common stock, regardless of the actual plans of our existing stockholders. Immediately after this offering, approximately 7,914,000 shares of our common stock will be outstanding, or 8,289,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. Of these shares, all of the shares included in this offering will be available for immediate resale in the public market, except those held by our "affiliates." Of the remaining shares outstanding, all but 520 shares are subject to lock-up agreements restricting the sale of such shares for 180 days from the date of this prospectus.

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this prospectus, before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks and uncertainty that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that negatively affect us. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. in that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or even all of your investment. risks related to our business and industry we have a history of losses and anticipate continued losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. we have incurred significant losses to date, with an accumulated deficit of $550.5 million as of december 31, 2012. for the years ended december31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we incurred net loss of $(148.4) million, $(92.4) million and $(89.7) million, respectively. we expect these losses to continue. we anticipate negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future, as we expect to incur significant operating expenses in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business. our expenses include research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, selling and marketing expenses and customer service and support expenses. many of these expenses relate to prospective utility customers that may never place any orders and products that may not be introduced or generate revenue until later periods, if at all. there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations, and, as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. our revenue, billings and other operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. while our revenue and billings have increased in recent periods, there can be no assurances that our revenue and billings will continue to increase or will not decrease on a quarterly or annual basis. for example, we had lower revenue for the three months ended december31, 2012 compared to the three months ended december31, 2011. we also expect revenue and billings for the three months ending march 31, 2013 to decline sequentially from the results for the three months ended december 31, 2012. in particular, the expected revenue decline for the three months ending march 31, 2013 may be substantial and may lead to a gross loss for the period, revenue in 2013 may not reach the levels achieved in 2012, and we anticipate that revenue will fluctuate from period to period throughout 2013. in addition, gross margin on billings for the three months ended december 31, 2012 declined period over period. we anticipate gross margin on billings will decline sequentially and period over period for the three months ending march 31, 2013 and expect gross margin on billings to fluctuate from period to period throughout 2013 and beyond. we also expect operating losses and we anticipate adjusted ebitda may be negative in certain future periods. see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. 18 the factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results and cause our stock price to fluctuate include, but are not limited to: long, and sometimes unpredictable, sales and customer deployment cycles; changes in the mix of products and services sold; our dependence on a limited number of utility customers; the timing of acceptance of our products and services by our utility customers, which can have a material impact on when we recognize related revenue under our revenue recognition policies; changing market conditions; competition; failures of our products, components that we use in our products or third-party devices containing our products that delay deployments, harm our reputation or result in high warranty costs, contractual penalties or terminations; product or project failures by third-party vendors, utility customers or competitors that result in the cancellation, slowing down or deferring of projects; liquidated damages provisions in our contracts, which could result in significant financial penalties if triggered or, even if not triggered, could affect our ability to recognize revenue in a given period; the ability of our suppliers and manufacturers to deliver supplies and products to us on a timely basis; delays associated with government funding programs for smart grid projects; delays in regulatory approvals for our utility customers and utility customer deployments; political and consumer sentiment and the related impact on the scope and timing of smart grid deployment; and economic, regulatory and political conditions in the markets where we operate or anticipate operating. as a result, we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be. it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock may decline.sales cycles to utility customers can be lengthy and unpredictable and require significant employee time and financial resources with no assurances that a prospective customer will select our products and services. sales cycles with utilities, our potential customers, tend to be long and unpredictable. utilities generally have extensive budgeting, procurement, competitive bidding, technical and performance review, and regulatory approval processes that can take up to several years to complete. utilities may choose, and many historically have often chosen, to follow industry trends rather than be early adopters of new products or services, which can extend the lead time for or prevent acceptance of more recently introduced products or services such as ours. in addition, in many instances, a utility may require one or more pilot programs to test our new products and services before committing to a larger deployment. these pilot programs may be quite lengthy and further delay the sales cycle with no 19 assurance that they will lead to a larger deployment or future sales. furthermore, to the extent our products are required to be deployed with the products of others, such as meters, delays related to such third-party products will further lengthen the sales cycle. this extended sales process requires us to dedicate significant time by our senior management, and sales and marketing and customer services personnel, and to use significant financial resources without any assurance of success or recovery of our related expenses. similarly, we are likely to incur these significant operating expenses well ahead of recognizing the related revenue because our ability to recognize revenue is typically dependent on meeting contractual customer acceptance and other requirements. the lengthy sales cycles of our products and services also make it difficult to forecast new customer deployments, as well as the volume and timing of orders, which, in turn makes forecasting our future results of operations challenging. in the event that we publicly disclose any forecasts of our future results of operations or other performance metrics and those forecasts ultimately turn out to be inaccurate, the value of our common stock could significantly decline. in addition, we have agreements with both of our primary contract manufacturers, which provide for tiered volume-based pricing. to the extent our volumes decrease below specific thresholds, our gross profit and gross margins will be negatively impacted, which has occurred previously. alternatively, in order to take advantage of the tiered volume-based pricing in any one quarter, we may purchase, and have previously purchased, additional inventory exposing us to the risk that we may incur costs for excess and obsolete inventory.our revenue is not predictable and recognition of a significant portion of it will be deferred into future periods. once a utility decides to move forward with a large-scale deployment of our products and services, the timing of and our ability to recognize related revenue will depend on several factors, some of which may not be under our control. these factors include shipment schedules that may be delayed or subject to modification, the rate at which our utility customers choose to deploy our smart energy platform, customer acceptance of all or any part of our products and services, our contractual commitments to provide new or enhanced functionality at some point in the future, other contractual provisions such as liquidated damages, our manufacturers ability to provide an adequate supply of components, the requirement to obtain regulatory approval, and our ability to deliver quality products according to expected schedules. in light of these factors, the application of complex revenue recognition rules to our products and services has required us to defer, and in the future will likely continue to require us to defer, a significant amount of revenue until undetermined future periods. as of december31, 2012, we had $508.1million in deferred revenue. it may be difficult to predict the amount of revenue that we will recognize in any given period and amounts recognized may fluctuate significantly from one period to the next.amounts included in our total backlog and order backlog may not result in actual billings or revenue or translate into profits. our total backlog represents future product and service billings that we expect to generate pursuant to contracts that we have entered into with our utility customers and meter manufacturers. our total backlog includes our order backlog, which represents future billings for open purchase orders and other firm commitments. we anticipate that our total backlog and order backlog will fluctuate from period to period throughout 2013 and beyond. we cannot guarantee that our total backlog or order backlog will result in actual billings in the originally anticipated period or at all. in addition, the contracts reflected in our total backlog and order 20 backlog may not generate margins equal to or better than our historical operating results. we only recently began to track total backlog and order backlog on a consistent basis as performance measures and as a result, we do not have significant experience in determining the level of realization that we will actually achieve on our total backlog and order backlog. our customer contracts are typically structured as master purchase and service agreements, or msas, under which the customer may place purchase orders over the course of a deployment. these deployments can extend for a number of years. because our msas do not typically require a customer or meter partner to purchase a minimum amount of product or services, total backlog is an estimate based upon contractual terms, existing purchase orders and other available information regarding the amount and timing of expected future purchase orders to be placed by our utility customers and meter manufacturers, including non-binding forecasts. no assurance can be made that firm purchase orders will be placed under these msas in the amounts we estimate, within the time period we expect, or at all. total backlog is subject to adjustments due to the long-term nature of our customer deployments. adjustments can result from a variety of factors, including changes in the nature or scope of customer deployments, the impact of contingency provisions related to future delivery or performance, customer cancellations, market conditions, delayed regulatory approvals and customer defaults. delays due to external market factors or delays in deployments and required regulatory approvals have in the past and may in the future cause us to extend the deployment schedule or make modifications under customer contracts. for example, ongoing regulatory uncertainties have affected the timing of the planned deployment schedule of commonwealth edison company, or comed, following the illinois commerce commissions decision in october 2012 to deny comed recovery from its customers of certain costs.following this decision, comed announced that it would delay key elements of its grid modernization project until 2015, which will cause our billings to comed to be correspondingly delayed. comed represents a substantial portion of our total backlog. in addition, under our msas, our utility customers generally have the right to terminate the msa for any reason, including for their sole convenience, a material breach or insolvency on our part or their inability to obtain required regulatory approval. the occurrence of such adjustments or terminations could materially reduce the amount of, or delay the fulfillment of, our total and order backlog. if our total backlog or order backlog fails to materialize as expected, we could experience a material reduction in future billings, revenue, operating results or cash flow.we are dependent on the utility industry, which has experienced volatility in capital spending. this volatility could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from period to period. similar to other industries, the utility industry has been affected by recent economic factors, including continued global economic uncertainty, concerns over the downgrade of u.s. sovereign debt and continued sovereign debt, monetary and financial uncertainties in european and other foreign countries. we derive substantially all of our revenue from sales of products and services directly and indirectly to utilities. purchases of our products and services may be reduced or deferred as a result of many factors including economic downturns and uncertainty, slowdowns in new residential and commercial construction, a utilitys access to capital on acceptable terms, the timing and availability of government grants or incentives, utility specific financial circumstances, mergers and acquisitions, regulatory decisions, weather conditions, consumer opposition and fluctuating interest rates. even with economic recovery, it may take time for our utility customers to establish new budgets and return to normal purchasing patterns. we cannot predict the reoccurrence of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of the economic recovery, worldwide, in the united states or in our industry. we have experienced, and may in the future experience, variability in operating results on an annual and a quarterly basis as a result of these factors. because a significant portion of our expenses is fixed in the short term or is incurred in advance of anticipated sales, we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales. this could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. substantially all of our current products depend on the availability and are subject to the regulation of radio spectrum in the united states and abroad. substantially all of our current hardware products are designed to communicate wirelessly via radio frequencies and therefore depend on the availability of adequate radio spectrum in order to operate. while these products could be designed to operate in a variety of different frequencies or by using other technologies such as cellular, in the united states they are primarily designed to form a wireless rf mesh using the unlicensed 902-928 megahertz, or mhz, band. the 902-928 mhz band is available for a wide variety of uses and requires us to manage interference by other users who operate in accordance with the federal communications commission, or fcc, rules. the unlicensed frequencies are also often the subject of proposals to the fcc requesting a change in the rules under which such frequencies may be used. in the past, the fcc has re-allocated spectrum for new or additional uses, and has adopted changes to the requirements for equipment using radio spectrum. it is possible that the fcc or the u.s. congress could adopt additional changes, which may be incompatible with our current or future product offerings, as well as products currently installed in the field, or require them to be modified at significant, or even prohibitive, cost. if the unlicensed frequencies become unacceptably crowded, restrictive or subject to changed laws, regulations or rules governing their use, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. our international growth and future success also depend on the availability of radio spectrum that is compatible with our products or on our ability to develop products that use alternative communications technology, such as gen4, our next-generation networking technology, which is available to utility customers in some products today, with more products coming this year, and will support cellular communications. in australia, we primarily use unlicensed spectrum in the 915-928mhz band with relatively minimal modifications needed to our products. in many other countries, however, there may not be spectrum available or we may be required to obtain a license to operate in any frequency band that is compatible with our products, including, but not limited to, the 902-928 mhz band. licenses to appropriate spectrum in these countries may be unavailable or only available at unreasonably high prices. similarly, in the event that we were only able to obtain a license outside of the 902-928 mhz band, the cost of modifying or redesigning our products to make them compatible with available spectrum could be significant or even cost-prohibitive. alternatively, if we are not able to obtain available spectrum on financially advantageous terms, we may not be able to compete without investing in alternative communication technology. if limitations on the availability of spectrum or the cost of making necessary modifications or investments in new technology preclude us from selling our products in markets outside of the united states, our growth, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.a limited number of our utility customers are responsible for a significant portion of our billings, revenue and cash flow. a decrease in sales to these utility customers or delays in customer deployments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. a substantial majority of our revenue, billings and cash flow depends on relatively large sales to a limited number of utility customers. the combination of lengthy sales cycles and relatively large sales to a small number of utility customers increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our billings, revenue and operating results. please see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationskey elements of operating and financial performance for further information regarding customer concentration. our master purchase and service agreements, or msas, do not impose purchase obligations on our utility customers until we have received a purchase order or agreed to a statement of work. further, the msas are typically subject to termination for any reason, including for convenience following a specified notice period. we expect that a limited number of utility customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in future periods. changes 22 in the business requirements, vendor selection, or purchasing behavior of our utility customers could significantly decrease our sales. in addition, our msas are complex, often requiring close coordination with our customers over extended preparation and deployment periods and involving large-scale delivery of our products and services.from time to time we have experienced and may in the future experience challenges in satisfying our customers throughout these preparation and deployment periods regarding all aspects of our performance. additionally, we have, in the past, received correspondence from customers claiming that there have been deficiencies in our timeliness and coordination regarding hardware, software and services for deployment, and requesting that we remedy the deficiencies noted.if we are unable to address customers concerns, we could be required to pay penalties, liquidated damages or other expenses, the customer could terminate our msa and our reputation could be damaged. additionally, delays in customer deployments can affect our results of operations. for example, ongoing regulatory uncertainties have affected the timing of comeds planned deployment schedule following the illinois commerce commissions decision in october 2012 to deny comed recovery from its customers of certain costs.following this decision, comed announced that it would delay key elements of its grid modernization project until 2015, which will cause our billings to comed to be correspondingly delayed. comed represents a substantial portion of our total backlog. any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.our marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to receive positive references from our existing utility customers. our marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to call on our current utility customers to provide positive references to new, potential utility customers. given our limited number of utility customers, the loss or dissatisfaction of any customer could substantially harm our brand and reputation, inhibit the market acceptance of our products and services, and impair our ability to attract new utility customers and maintain existing utility customers. any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.the market for our products and services, and smart grid technology generally, is still developing. if the market develops less extensively or more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. the market for our products and services, and smart grid technology generally, is still developing, and it is uncertain whether our products and services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. our near-term and long-term success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness and ability of utilities to implement smart grid technology. many utilities lack the financial resources and/or technical expertise required to evaluate, deploy and operate smart grid technology. utilities activities are governed by regulatory agencies, including public utility commissions, which may not create a regulatory environment that is conducive to the implementation of smart grid technologies in a particular jurisdiction. furthermore, some utilities may be reluctant or unwilling to adopt smart grid technology because they do not perceive the benefits or are unable to develop a business case to justify the up-front and ongoing expenditures. if utilities do not implement smart grid technology or do so in fewer numbers or more slowly than we expect, our business and operating results would be adversely affected. for example, in 2010, the rate of smart grid adoption slowed due to uncertainty surrounding the timing and tax treatment of u.s. government stimulus funding, negative publicity and consumer opposition, and regulatory investigations. these uncertainties caused many potential utility customers that had been considering smart grid programs in the united states to further evaluate their smart grid initiatives and delay their procurement processes or extend their deployment schedules. smart grid adoption in international markets has trailed adoption in the united states as international markets continue to explore the technology and define the benefits and regulatory requirements for the smart grid. 23 similarly, our success depends on our ability to expand beyond advanced metering sales and sell additional products and services, such as distribution automation and demand-side management solutions, to our existing utility customers. there can be no assurance that these products and services will be accepted by utilities or consumers. other competing products and services may emerge and may be more successful.adverse publicity about, or consumer or political opposition to, the smart grid could inhibit the growth of the overall market. the safety and security of the power grid, the accuracy and protection of the data collected by meters and transmitted via the smart grid, and concerns about the safety and perceived health risks of using radio frequency communications have been the focus of recent adverse publicity. for example, in northern california, pg&es full-scale deployment of our networking platform and advanced metering solution has been subject to continued scrutiny following allegations of inaccurate bills generated by newly-installed smart meters and safety concerns about the levels of radio frequency electromagnetic fields emitted by the wireless communications technology used by the meters. as a result, the california state senate created a special committee and the california public utilities commission, or cpuc, hired an independent investigator to review the installation and use of advanced metering products. negative publicity and consumer opposition in california, maine and elsewhere has caused other utilities or their regulators to respond by delaying or modifying planned smart grid initiatives, mandating that utilities allow their customers to opt out of smart metering programs, or calling for investigations and/or implementation of unfavorable regulations and legislation. for example, in january 2012, the cpuc ruled that pg&e must let its customers retain or receive an analog meter, for nominal initial and monthly fees, if they, for any reason, opt out of pg&es deployment of pg&es smart meters. similarly, outside the united states, public concern over smart grid projects in places such as victoria, australia has resulted in increased government scrutiny. additionally, testing commissioned by the cpuc and other organizations could, in the future, contain negative information regarding the accuracy and safety of smart grid solutions. finally, smart grid projects by other companies may be, or could be viewed by the public as, unsuccessful. any of the foregoing factors could directly impact our current or future deployments, as well as inhibit the growth of the overall smart grid market, either of which could cause our business to suffer.security breaches involving our smart grid products or services, publicized breaches in smart grid products and services offered by others, or the public perception of security risks or vulnerability created by the deployment of the smart grid in general, whether or not valid, could harm our business. the security technologies we have integrated into our networking platform and solutions that are designed to detect unauthorized activity and prevent or minimize security breaches may not function as expected and there can be no assurance that our products and services, those of other companies with whose products our products and services are integrated or interact, or even the products of other smart grid solutions providers will not be subject to significant real or perceived security breaches. our networking platform allows utilities to collect, monitor, store, compile and analyze sensitive information related to consumers energy usage, as well as the performance of different parts of the power grid. as part of our data transfer and managed services and saas, we may store and/or come into contact with sensitive consumer information and data when we perform operational, installation or maintenance functions for our utility customers. if, in handling this information, we, our partners or our utility customers fail to comply with privacy or security laws, we could face significant legal and financial exposure to claims of government agencies, utilitycustomers and consumers whose privacy is compromised. even the perception that we, our partners or our utility customers have improperly handled sensitive, confidential information could have a negative effect on our business. in addition, 24 third parties may attempt to breach our security measures or inappropriately use or access our network services or the network hardware and software we have in the field through computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and other means. if a breach is successful, sensitive information may be improperly obtained, manipulated or corrupted, and we may face legal and financial exposure. in addition, a breach could lead to a loss of confidence in our products and services and our business could suffer. our current and anticipated future products and services allow authorized personnel to remotely control equipment at residential and commercial locations, as well as at various points on the power grid. for example, our software allows a utility to remotely connect and disconnect electricity at specific customer locations. if an unauthorized third party were to breach our security measures and disrupt, gain access to or take control of any of our products or services, our business and reputation could be severely harmed. our products and services may also be integrated or interface with products and services sold by third parties, and rely on the security of those products and their secure transmission of proprietary data over the internet and cellular networks. because we do not have control over the security measures implemented by third parties in their products or in the transmission of data over the internet and cellular networks, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such third-party products and transmissions. concerns about security or customer privacy may result in the adoption of state or federal legislation that restricts the implementation of smart grid technology or requires us to make modifications to our products, which could significantly limit the deployment of our technologies or result in significant expense to modify our products. any real or perceived security breach could seriously harm our reputation and result in significant legal and financial exposure, including increased remediation costs and security protection costs, inhibit market acceptance of our products and services, halt or delay the deployment by utilities of our products and services, cause us to lose customers, harm our reputation, trigger unfavorable legislation and regulatory action, and inhibit the growth of the overall market for smart grid products and services. any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.if our products contain defects or otherwise fail to perform as expected, we could be liable for damages and incur unanticipated warranty, recall and other related expenses, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose market share and, as a result, our financial condition or results of operations could suffer. our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design, materials, deployment and/or use. if any of our products contain a defect, compatibility or interoperability issue or other error, we may have to devote significant time and resources to find and correct the issue. such efforts could divert the attention of our management team and other relevant personnel from other important tasks. a product recall or a significant number of product returns could: be expensive; damage our reputation and relationships with utilities, meter vendors and other third-party vendors; result in the loss of business to competitors; and result in litigation against us. costs associated with field replacement labor, hardware replacement, </td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors investing in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information appearing elsewhere in this prospectus, including our financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects and cause the market price of our common stock to decline, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our business and industry we have incurred significant net losses since our inception and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability on an annual basis in the future. we have incurred significant net losses since our inception. for the years ended december31, 2009, 2010, and 2011, we had net losses of $58.7 million, $15.4 million, and $4.3 million, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $224.9million as of june30, 2012. we cannot predict if we will achieve or maintain annual profitability in the near future or at all. our recent growth, including our growth in revenue and customer base, may not be sustainable or may decrease, and we may not generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain annual profitability. moreover, we expect to continue to make significant expenditures to maintain and expand our business, operate as a consolidated entity with our newly acquired subsidiary, id analytics, and transition to operating as a public company. these increased expenditures will make it more difficult for us to achieve and maintain future annual profitability. our ability to achieve and maintain annual profitability depends on a number of factors, including our ability to attract and service customers on a profitable basis. if we are unable to achieve or maintain annual profitability, we may not be able to execute our business plan, our prospects may be harmed, and our stock price could be materially and adversely affected.if the security of confidential information used in connection with our services is breached or otherwise subject to unauthorized access, our reputation and business may be materially harmed. our services require us to collect, store, use, and transmit significant amounts of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, credit card information, and other critical data. we employ a range of information technology solutions, controls, procedures, and processes designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical assets, including our data and information technology systems. while we engage in a number of measures aimed to protect against security breaches and to minimize problems if a data breach were to occur, our information technology systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, compromise, disruption, and shutdown due to attacks or breaches by hackers or due to other circumstances, such as employee error or malfeasance or technology malfunction. the occurrence of any of these events, as well as a failure to promptly remedy these events should they occur, could compromise our systems, and the information stored in our systems could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, stolen, or damaged. any such circumstance could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain customers as well as strategic partnerships, cause us to suffer negative publicity, and subject us to legal claims and liabilities or regulatory penalties. in addition, unauthorized parties might alter information in our databases, which would adversely affect both the reliability of that information and our ability to market and perform our services. techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are difficult to recognize and react to effectively and are constantly evolving. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or reactive measures. several recent, highly publicized data security breaches at other companies have heightened 14 consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems or those of our strategic partners or enterprise customers. security technologies and information, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties, are a key aspect of our security measures designed to secure our critical assets. while we routinely seek to update these technologies and information, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments may result in the technology we use becoming obsolete, breached, or compromised and cause us to incur additional expenses associated with upgrading our security systems. in addition, security information provided to us by third parties may be inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated, which could cause us to make misinformed security decisions and could materially and adversely affect our business. under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses if there is a breach of payment card information that we store. in addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or pay their fees. if we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be materially harmed. many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. in the united states, federal and state laws provide for over 45 laws and notification regimes, all of which we are subject to, and additional requirements may be instituted in the future. in the event of a data security breach, these mandatory disclosures often lead to widespread negative publicity. in addition, complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of a data security breach is often expensive, difficult, and time consuming, and the failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability and harm our reputation. any actual or perceived security breach, whether successful or not and whether or not attributable to the failure of our services or our information technology systems, as well as our failure to promptly and appropriately react to a breach, would likely harm our reputation, adversely affect market perception of our services, and cause the loss of customers and strategic partnerships. our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses or failures that may occur. our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost, and our decisions with respect to risk retention.our business is highly dependent upon our brand recognition and reputation, and the failure to maintain or enhance our brand recognition or reputation would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. our brand recognition and reputation are critical aspects of our business. we believe that maintaining and further enhancing our lifelock and id analytics brands as well as our reputation will be critical to retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. we also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation will continue to increase as competition in our markets continues to develop. our success in this area will be dependent on a wide range of factors, some of which are out of our control, including the following: the efficacy of our marketing efforts; our ability to retain existing and obtain new customers and strategic partners; the quality and perceived value of our services; actions of our competitors, our strategic partners, and other third parties; 15 positive or negative publicity, including material on the internet; regulatory and other governmental related developments; and litigation related developments. sales and marketing expenses have historically been our largest operating expense, and we anticipate these expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to seek to grow our business and customer base and enhance our brand. these brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and the efficacy of these activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to do the following: determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for advertising, marketing, and promotional expenditures; select the right markets, media, and specific media vehicles in which to advertise; identify the most effective and efficient level of spending in each market, media, and specific media vehicle; and effectively manage marketing costs, including creative and media expenses, in order to maintain acceptable customer acquisition costs. increases in the pricing of one or more of our marketing and advertising channels could increase our marketing and advertising expenses or cause us to choose less expensive but possibly less effective marketing and advertising channels. if we implement new marketing and advertising strategies, we may utilize marketing and advertising channels with significantly higher costs than our current channels, which in turn could adversely affect our operating results. implementing new marketing and advertising strategies also would increase the risk of devoting significant capital and other resources to endeavors that do not prove to be cost effective. further, we may over time become disproportionately reliant on one channel or strategic partner, which could limit our marketing and advertising flexibility and increase our operating expenses. we also may incur marketing and advertising expenses significantly in advance of the time we anticipate recognizing revenue associated with such expenses, and our marketing and advertising expenditures may not generate sufficient levels of brand awareness or result in increased revenue. even if our marketing and advertising expenses result in increased revenue, the increase might not offset our related expenditures. if we are unable to maintain our marketing and advertising channels on cost-effective terms or replace or supplement existing marketing and advertising channels with similarly or more effective channels, our marketing and advertising expenses could increase substantially, our customer base could be adversely affected, and our business, operating results, financial condition, and reputation could suffer. furthermore, negative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, our strategic partners, our affiliates, or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our services and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful.we face intense competition, and we may not be able to compete effectively, which could reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our business, growth, reputation, revenue, and market share. we operate in a highly competitive business environment. our primary competitors are the credit bureaus that include experian, equifax, and transunion, as well as others, such as affinion, early 16 warning systems, intersections, and lexisnexis. some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them competitive advantages. as a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of services, to deliver competitive services at lower prices or for free, and to introduce new solutions and respond to market developments and customer requirements more quickly than we can. in addition, some of our competitors may have data that we do not have or cannot obtain without difficulty. any of these factors could reduce our growth, revenue, access to valuable data, or market share. our ability to compete successfully in our markets depends on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. some of these factors include the following: access to a breadth of identity and consumer transaction data; breadth and effectiveness of service offerings, including designing and introducing new services; brand recognition; technology; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of customer acquisition; customer satisfaction; price; quality and reliablity of customer service; and accurate identification of appropriate target markets for our business. any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or similar areas may reduce the demand for our services and the robustness of the lifelock ecosystem, as well as adversely affect our business, growth, reputation, revenue, and market share. moreover, new competitors, alliances among our competitors, or new service introductions by our competitors may emerge and potentially adversely affect our business and prospects.we could lose our access to data sources, which could cause us competitive harm and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. our services depend extensively upon continued access to and receipt of data from external sources, including data received from customers and fulfillment partners. our data providers could stop providing data, provide untimely data, or increase the costs for their data for a variety of reasons, including a perception that our systems are insecure as a result of a data security breach, budgetary constraints, a desire to generate additional revenue, or for competitive reasons. in addition, upon the termination of the contracts we have with certain of our enterprise customers, we are required to remove from our repositories the data contributed by and through those customers. we could also become subject to legislative, regulatory, or judicial restrictions or mandates on the collection, disclosure, or use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by our providers in a way that allows us to legally use the data. if we were to lose access to a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources or certain data already in the lifelock ecosystem, or if our access or use were restricted or became less economical or desirable, our ability to provide our services and the efficacy and attractiveness of the lifelock ecosystem could be negatively affected, and this would adversely affect us from a competitive standpoint. this would also adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. we may not be successful in maintaining our relationships with these external data source providers and may not be able to continue to obtain data from them on 17 acceptable terms or at all. furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain data from alternative or additional sources if our current sources become unavailable.we may lose customers and significant revenue and fail to attract new customers if our existing services become less desirable or obsolete, or if we fail to develop and introduce new services with broad appeal or fail to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner. the introduction of new services by competitors, the emergence of new industry standards, or the development of new technologies could render our existing or future services less desirable or obsolete. in addition, professional thieves continue to develop more sophisticated and creative methods to steal personal and financial information as consumers and enterprises today become increasingly interconnected and engage in a large number of daily activities that involve personal or financial information. consequently, our financial performance and growth depends upon our ability to enhance and improve our existing services, develop and successfully introduce new services that generate customer interest, and sell our services in new markets. as our existing services mature, encouraging customers to purchase enhancements or upgrades becomes more challenging unless new service offerings provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value. to achieve market acceptance for our services, we must effectively anticipate and offer services that meet changing customer demands in a timely manner. customers may require features and capabilities that our current services lack. in addition, any new markets in which we attempt to sell our services, including new industries, countries, or regions, may not be receptive to our service offerings. if we fail to enhance our existing services in a timely and cost-effective manner, successfully develop and introduce new services, or sell our services in new markets, our ability to retain our existing or attract new customers and our ability to create or increase demand for our services could be harmed, which would have an adverse affect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. we will be required to make significant investments in developing new services. we also will be subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new services, including unanticipated technical or other development problems, which could result in material delays in the launch and acceptance of the services or significantly increased costs. in some cases, we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on service offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets. because new service offerings are inherently risky, they may not be successful and may harm our operating results and financial condition. the number of people who access services through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers, and tablets, has increased dramatically in recent years. we have limited experience to date in developing services for users of these alternative devices, and versions of our services developed for these devices may not be attractive to customers. as new devices, platforms, and technologies are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our services for use with these devices, platforms, and technologies and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such offerings. if we are slow to develop services and technologies that are compatible with these devices, platforms, and technologies, or if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, which could adversely affect our business.our revenue and operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing customers, and any decline in our retention rates will harm our future revenue and operating results. our revenue and operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing customers. in our consumer business from which we derive a significant majority of our revenue, we 18 sell our services to our members on a monthly or annual subscription basis. our members may cancel their membership with us at any time without penalty. in our enterprise business, our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us after the contractual term expires and approximately half of our direct enterprise customers do not have monthly transaction minimums and, accordingly, may reduce their utilization of our services during the contractual term. we therefore may be unable to retain our existing members and enterprise customers on the same or on more profitable terms, if at all, and may generate lower revenue as a result of less utilization of our services by our enterprise customers. in addition, we may not be able to predict or anticipate accurately future trends in customer retention or enterprise customer utilization, or effectively respond to such trends. our customer retention rates and enterprise customer utilization may decline or fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including the following: our customers levels of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services; the quality, breadth, and prices of our services; our general reputation and events impacting that reputation; the services and related pricing offered by our competitors; our customer service and responsiveness to any customer complaints; customer dissatisfaction if they do not receive the full benefit of our services due to their failure to provide all relevant data; customer dissatisfaction with the methods or extent of our remediation services; our guarantee may not meet our customers expectations; and changes in our target customers spending levels as a result of general economic conditions or other factors. if we do not retain our existing customers, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our operating results and gross margins will be harmed. in addition, our business and operating results may be harmed if we are unable to increase our retention rates. we also must continually add new customers both to replace customers who cancel or elect not to renew their agreements with us and to grow our business beyond our current customer base. if we are unable to attract new customers in numbers greater than the percentage of customers who cancel or elect not to renew their agreements with us, which we call churn, our customer base will decrease and our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected. churn negatively impacts the predictability of our subscription revenue model and the efficacy and attractiveness of the lifelock ecosystem by decreasing the amount of data being added to our data repositories.we depend on strategic partners in our consumer business, and our inability to maintain our existing and secure new relationships with strategic partners could harm our revenue and operating results. we have derived, and intend to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from members who subscribe to our consumer services through one of our strategic partners. in 2011, we derived approximately 45% of our gross new members from our strategic partner distribution channels. these distribution channels involve various risks, including the following: we may be unable to maintain or secure favorable relationships with strategic partners; our strategic partners may not be successful in expanding our membership base; our strategic partners may seek to renegotiate the economic terms of our relationships; 19 our strategic partners may terminate their relationships with us; bad publicity and other issues faced by our strategic partners could negatively impact us; and our strategic partners, some of which already compete with us, may present increased competition for us in the future. our inability to maintain our existing and secure new relationships with strategic partners could harm our revenue and operating results. many of our key strategic partnerships are governed by agreements that may be terminated without cause and without penalty by our strategic partners upon notice of as few as 30 days. under many of our agreements with strategic partners, our partners may cease or reduce their marketing of our services at their discretion, which may cause us to lose access to prospective members and significantly reduce our revenue and operating results. some of our strategic partners possess significant resources and advanced technical abilities. some offer services that are competitive with ours and more may do so in the future, either alone or in collaboration with other competitors. those strategic partners could give a higher priority to competing services or decide not to continue to offer our services at all. if any of our strategic partners discontinue or reduce the sale or marketing of our services, promote competitive services, or, either independently or jointly with others, develop and market services that compete with our services, our business and operating results may be harmed. in addition, some of our strategic partners may experience financial or other difficulties, causing our revenue through those strategic partners to decline, which would adversely affect our operating results. in order for us to implement our business strategy and grow our revenue, we must effectively manage and expand our relationships with qualified strategic partners. we expend significant time and resources in attracting qualified strategic partners, training those partners in our technology and service offerings, and then maintaining relationships with those partners. in order to continue to develop and expand our distribution channels, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our partnerships. those processes and procedures could become increasingly complex and difficult to manage. our competitors also use arrangements with strategic partners, and it could be more difficult for us to maintain and expand our distribution channels if they are more successful in attracting strategic partners or enter into exclusive relationships with strategic partners. if we fail to maintain our existing or secure new relationships with strategic partners, our business will be harmed.a limited number of enterprise customers provide a significant portion of our enterprise revenue, and our inability to retain these customers or attract new customers could harm our revenue and operating results and the efficacy and attractiveness of the lifelock ecosystem. id analytics has historically derived, and continues to derive, a significant portion of its revenue from a limited number of enterprise customers. for example, in 2010, 2011, and the six months ended june 30, 2012, sales derived through id analytics top ten customers accounted for 77%, 70%, and 66%, respectively, of id analytics revenue for those periods. in addition, some of these customers provide services that compete with our consumer services and, accordingly, may seek alternative identity risk assessment and fraud protection services in the future. the loss of several of our enterprise customers, or of any of our large enterprise customers, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations, as well as the efficacy and attractiveness of the lifelock ecosystem. in addition, new customer acquisition in our enterprise business is often a lengthy process requiring significant up-front investment. accordingly, we may devote substantial resources in an effort 20 to attract new enterprise customers that may not result in customer engagements or lead to an increase in revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.if we experience system failures or interruptions in our telecommunications or information technology infrastructure, it may impair the availability of our services, our revenue could decrease, and our reputation could be harmed. our operations depend upon our ability to protect the telecommunications and information technology systems utilized in our services against damage or system interruptions from natural disasters, technical failures, human error, and other events. we send and receive credit and other data, as well as key communications to and from our members, electronically, and this delivery method is susceptible to damage, delay, or inaccuracy. a portion of our business involves telephonic customer service and online enrollments, which depends upon the data generated from our computer systems. unanticipated problems with our telecommunications and information technology systems may result in data loss, which could interrupt our operations. our telecommunications or information technology infrastructure upon which we rely also may be vulnerable to computer viruses, hackers, or other disruptions.we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development, operational, support, sales, accounting, and financial reporting activities, the failure of which could disrupt our business operations and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our reputation. we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development, operational, support, sales, accounting, and financial reporting activities. we routinely invest resources to update and improve these systems and environments with the goal of better meeting the existing, as well as the growing and changing requirements of our customers. if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture, we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain service offerings and develop new service offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive. such improvements and upgrades often are complex, costly, and time consuming. in addition, such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may result in problems with our existing technology systems. unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages, disruption in our business operations, loss of revenue, or damage to our reputation. our systems and data are hosted by a third-party data center. if the third-party data center experiences any disruptions, outages, or catastrophes, it could disrupt our business and result in a loss of customers, loss of revenue, or damage to our reputation. we recently experienced an outage in one of our data centers in our enterprise business, which interrupted our business. we are planning to replace this facility with a more modern facility in a different location, but the relocation could be more time consuming, expensive, and complicated than anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will not experience outages in the future.natural or man-made disasters and other similar events may significantly disrupt our and our strategic partners or service providers businesses, and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. our enterprise business headquarters and the back up data center for our enterprise business are located in san diego, california, which is situated on or near earthquake fault lines. our primary data center for our enterprise business is located in atlanta, georgia, although we expect to relocate this data center to las vegas, nevada in the fall of 2012. in our consumer business, we have data centers in rancho cordova, california and scottsdale, arizona. any of our or our strategic partners or service providers facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, 21 including earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, floods, nuclear disasters, acts of terrorism or other criminal activities, infectious disease outbreaks, and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us or our strategic partners or service providers to operate our respective businesses for some period of time. our and our strategic partners or service providers facilities would likely be costly to repair or replace, and any such efforts would likely require substantial time. any disruptions in our or our strategic partners or service providers operations could negatively impact our business and results of operations, and harm our reputation. in addition, we and our strategic partners or service providers may not carry business insurance or may not carry sufficient business insurance to compensate for losses that may occur. any such losses or damages could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.changes in the economy may significantly affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. our business may be affected by changes in the economic environment. our services, particularly our consumer services, are discretionary purchases, and members may reduce or eliminate their discretionary spendin</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES, BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ANY OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT WE DO NOT KNOW ABOUT NOW OR THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. OUR BRIEF OPERATING HISTORY MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT OUR SUCCESSAppNet was formed in late 1997. We have a brief operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Our historical results of operations do not fully give effect to the operations of the companies we have acquired and the pro forma financial information included in this prospectus is based in part on the separate pre-acquisition financial information of the acquired companies. As a result, our historical results of operations and pro forma financial information may not give you an accurate indication of our future results of operations or prospects. Companies like us in an early stage of development frequently encounter risks, expenses and difficulties associated with starting a new business, many of which may be beyond their control. These risks and difficulties apply particularly to AppNet because our markets, Internet and electronic commerce professional services, are new and rapidly changing. WE HAVE AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $30.7 MILLION AND ANTICIPATE FUTURE LOSSESWe have incurred substantial losses since AppNet was founded, and we anticipate we will continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $30.7 million as of March 31, 1999 and a net loss of $14.4 million and $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 and the quarter ended March 31, 1999, respectively. We intend to continue to invest in internal expansion, infrastructure, integration of our acquired companies into our existing operations, acquisitions and our marketing and sales efforts. We cannot predict when we will operate profitably, if at all. AS OF MARCH 31, 1999, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $133.1 MILLION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETSNET OF ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, AND WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITION-RELATED COMPENSATION CHARGES We cannot assure you that we will have earnings or cash flow sufficient to cover our fixed charges or to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facilities. Our acquisitions significantly increased our intangible assets, such as goodwill, which represent a significant portion of our assets, and the charges we expect to incur in connection with the amortization of these intangible assets will have a material adverse impact on our net income for the foreseeable future. At March 31, 1999, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $133.1 million, net of accumulated amortization. In addition, in connection with the acquisitions we have completed, we expect to continue to incur through the end of the year 2000, acquisition-related compensation charges which will fluctuate based on the market price of our common stock and the level of achievement of agreed-upon operating targets. If all of the operating targets are fully met, the aggregate amounts of compensation expense and additional goodwill that will be recognized will be approximately $22.6 million and $8.2 million, respectively, assuming the market price of our common stock when the contingent payments are made is $12.00, the initial public offering price, for all shares issued in connection with these contingent payments. The compensation expense will be recognized during 1999 and 2000. See "--Our intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets; amortization of our intangible assets will adversely impact our net income and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets" for a discussion of accounting treatment issues regarding intangible assets that will affect our future results of operations. 4 QUARTER-TO-QUARTER FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS COULDAFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK Our revenues and operating results may vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of a number of factors including: - number, size and type of client engagements commenced or completed during a quarter; - effectiveness of integrating acquisitions with existing operations; - our ability to attract, train and retain skilled management, technical and creative personnel; - timing of acquisitions and related costs; and - timing and size of acquisition-related compensation charges which fluctuate based on the market price of our common stockBecause a high percentage of our expenses is fixed, such as compensation and rent, any of the factors listed above could cause significant variations in our operating results in any given quarter. Any decline in revenues or earnings or a greater than expected loss for any quarter could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, even if not reflective of any long-term problems with our business. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE ACQUIREDCOMPANIES AND MANAGE OUR GROWTH Our growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and operational and financial resources. We have acquired 12 companies since March 1998. Our number of employees has increased from eight as of March 15, 1998 to approximately 755 as of May 1, 1999. We are in the process of integrating the companies we have acquired since March 1998 into our operational, financial and managerial systems. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of their time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to service current clients, attract new clients and develop new products and services. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if any of the companies we have acquired experienced problems in the past of which we are not currently aware. Claims asserted against us relating to the operation of the companies we acquired prior to acquisition could exceed the indemnification we are entitled to or can obtain from the former owners of the acquired companiesAs we continue to grow, we expect we will hire more employees and expand the scope of our operating and financial systems, which will increase our operating complexity and the level of responsibility exercised by our management personnel. To manage our growth effectively, we must continue to develop and improve our own operational and financial systems, including our internal systems and controls as well as those of the companies we acquired. The failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. WE MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN PROFESSIONAL STAFF IN ORDER TO COMPLETE OUR PROJECTSAND OBTAIN NEW PROJECTS Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees could impair our ability to complete existing projects and bid for or obtain new projects and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to grow and increase our market share largely depends on our ability to hire, train, retain and manage highly skilled employees, including project managers and technical, creative, consulting and marketing and sales personnel. There is a significant shortage of, and intense competition for, personnel who are qualified to perform the services we provide. This shortage will probably continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, to maintain our position as a provider of Internet and electronic commerce end-to-end solutions, we must 5 make sure our employees maintain their technical expertise and business skills. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees or that we will successfully train and manage the employees we hireIn addition, our employees, including key technical personnel, may leave us to join our competitors or start new businesses which may compete with us. We cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our proprietary knowledge, practices and procedures if our employees leave us. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR FUTURE GROWTHOur ability to remain competitive and expand our operations through acquisitions and internal growth largely depends on our access to capital. Historically, we have financed capital expenditures and acquisitions primarily by incurring debt and issuing equity securities. We may incur additional debt and issue equity securities in the future to finance our growth strategy or capital expenditures. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all. Additional indebtedness would make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures. The terms of any additional indebtedness may include restrictive financial and operating covenants which would limit our ability to compete and expand. Additional issuances of our common stock may significantly dilute the equity interests of our existing stockholders. Our failure to obtain any required additional financing, on satisfactory terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a further discussion of our liquidity and capital requirements over the next 18 months. OUR REVENUES ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT BECAUSE THEY ARE PRIMARILY GENERATED ON APROJECT-BY-PROJECT BASIS AND OUR PROJECTS CAN BE TERMINATED If our existing agreements with clients are terminated before we complete our engagements, or if we are unable to enter into new engagements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our success will depend on our ability to establish relationships with additional medium-sized and large businesses and other corporate users of Internet and electronic commerce professional services. We derive our revenues in large part from fees for services generated on a project-by-project basis. These projects vary in size, scope and duration. A client that accounts for a significant portion of our revenues in a particular period may not account for a similar portion of our revenues in future periods. A client may or may not engage us for further services once a project is completed. As a result, our revenues are not recurring from period to period, which makes them more difficult to predict. OUR CONTRACTS CONTAIN PRICING RISKSGenerally, we charge our clients for the time, materials and expenses incurred. Although we have limited experience pricing and managing fixed-price contracts, we intend to increase the percentage of our work that is billed at a fixed price. However, if we underestimate the resources and time required to complete our projects, we could be subject to cost overruns leading to losses on our engagements. LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OURBUSINESS The loss of our senior managers' services or other key members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends heavily on the efforts of the members of our senior management team. We cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our proprietary knowledge, practices and procedures if our senior managers leave us. See "Management" for additional information about our senior managers. 6 WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITIONThe markets for Internet and electronic commerce professional services are relatively new, intensely competitive, quickly evolving and subject to rapid technological change. We expect competition to continue and intensify in the foreseeable future. Our competitors can be divided into several groups: - Internet professional services providers, such as Agency.com, iXL, Proxicom, Razorfish, Scient, Think New Ideas, US Interactive, USWeb/CKS and Viant; - large information technology consulting services providers, such as Andersen Consulting, Cambridge Technology Partners, CSC, EDS, IBM and Sapient; - interactive advertising agencies, such as Darwin Digital, Giant Step, Grey Interactive, Modem Media . Poppe Tyson and Thunderhouse; - electronic commerce software and service providers, such as BroadVision, Harbinger, Open Market and Sterling Commerce; and - Internet access and service providers, such as Abovenet, Exodus and Frontier/GlobalOur competitors have begun to offer multiple Internet and electronic commerce professional services, rather than specialize in one area, or have announced their intention to do so. These companies may continue to expand their operations so that they offer a full range of Internet and electronic commerce professional services and products. Some of our competitors, IBM, USWeb and EDS, currently provide all of the services that we provideMany of our competitors have longer operating histories and client relationships, greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources, larger client bases and greater brand or name recognition than we have. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to technological developments and changes in clients' needs. We must promote and enhance our reputation and brand in order to attract new clients and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. See "Business-- Competition" for a further discussion of competition within our industry. THE BARRIERS TO ENTER OUR BUSINESS ARE LOWThere are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. We do not own any technologies that preclude or inhibit competitors from entering our markets. Our competitors may independently develop and patent or copyright technologies that are superior or substantially similar to our technologies. The costs to develop and provide Internet or electronic commerce professional services are low. Therefore, we expect to continue to face additional competition from new entrants into our markets. WE MUST RESPOND TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCESOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to keep pace with: - rapidly changing technology; - evolving industry standards and practices; - frequent new service and product introductions and enhancements; and - changing user and client requirements and preferences Any delay or failure on our part in responding quickly, cost-effectively and sufficiently to these developments could render our existing products and services obsolete and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may have to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure to respond to the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes. We must stay abreast of cutting-edge technological developments and evolving service offerings to remain competitive, increase the utility of our services and attract and retain qualified employees. We must be 7 able to incorporate new technologies into the Internet and electronic commerce solutions we design and develop to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of our customer base. OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUED USE AND GROWTH OF THE INTERNET ANDELECTRONIC COMMERCE Our business would be adversely affected if use of the Internet and electronic commerce does not continue to develop, or develops more slowly than expected. Our market is relatively new and rapidly evolving. Our future success depends on the acceptance by current and future clients of Internet and electronic commerce professional services as an integral part of their businesses. Demand and market acceptance for these new technological services are subject to a high level of uncertaintyIn addition, if use of the Internet grows, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it. The performance and reliability of the Internet may decline as the number of users and the amount of traffic increases. Internet sites have experienced interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the Internet network infrastructure. To cope with growth in the use of the Internet, the Internet will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security and the timely development of complementary products, such as high-speed modems, for providing reliable Internet access and services. If the necessary infrastructure, products, services or facilities are not developed or if use of the Internet as a medium for communication and commerce does not develop, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. WE HAVE POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS WHO ARE DISSATISFIED WITH OUR SERVICESWe design, develop, implement and manage Internet and electronic commerce solutions that are crucial to the operation of our clients' businesses. Defects in the solutions we develop could result in delayed or lost revenues, adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about us or our services or require expensive corrections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Clients who are not satisfied with our services could bring claims against us for substantial damages. Any claims asserted against us could exceed the level of our insurance. We cannot assure you that the insurance we carry will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms, or at all. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are uninsured, exceed our insurance coverage or result in changes to our insurance policies, including premium increases, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. OUR FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR MAINTAIN OUR RIGHTSTO USE LICENSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS We believe our success depends, in part, on protecting our proprietary intellectual property. We have not received patent or copyright protection for most of our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent infringement or detect misappropriation of our intellectual property. A failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operationsWe rely on technologies licensed from third parties. We cannot assure you that these licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. The loss of these technologies could require us to obtain substitute technologies of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operationsThird parties may assert or prosecute infringement claims against us in connection with the services and products we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend any such claims. We generally indemnify our clients against any third-party intellectual property claims. Any significant claim against us or for which we have indemnified others could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 8 In connection with our Internet and electronic commerce professional services, we develop intellectual property for our clients. We frequently assign ownership of such intellectual property to the client and retain only a license for limited uses. Issues relating to ownership of and rights to use intellectual property can be complicated. We may become involved in disputes that affect our ability to resell or reuse this intellectual property. In addition, many of our projects involve the use of material that is confidential or proprietary client information. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us by our clients or other third parties could adversely affect us. WE SOMETIMES AGREE NOT TO PERFORM SERVICES FOR OUR CLIENTS' COMPETITORSOur customer contracts may contain restrictive provisions which are in effect during the term of the contract and may remain in effect for a limited period, generally one year, thereafter. The scope of the restrictive provisions varies and can include provisions restricting our employees who are engaged on a project for a client from performing the same or substantially similar services for a competitor of that client and provisions prohibiting us from developing products or performing services for our clients' competitors. These restrictive provisions may limit our ability to enter into engagements with new clients for specified periods of time. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND EXPANSION INVOLVE FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONALRISKS We intend to expand our business into international markets. Revenues from our existing international operations were insignificant in 1998. We may incur significant costs in connection with our international expansion There are also risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, such - changes in legal and regulatory requirements; - export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers; - currency fluctuations and the on-going conversion to the euro in several member states of the European Union; - difficulties in staffing and managing foreign offices as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences; - longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable; - political and economic instability; - seasonal reductions in business activity; and - potentially adverse tax consequencesAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our international and domestic business, financial condition and results of operations. OUR ELECTRONIC COMMERCE OUTSOURCING CENTERS COULD BE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY AND TECHNICAL RISKS AND MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT We provide electronic commerce outsourcing services to our customers. We perform electronic commerce functions that would otherwise be handled by the customer's internal staff using the customer's resourcesOur electronic commerce outsourcing services rely on encryption and authentication technology licenses from third parties to provide the security and authentication needed to safely transmit confidential information. Although we have designed and implemented a variety of network security measures, unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional acts and other disruptions 9 may occur. Our electronic commerce outsourcing centers may experience delays or service interruptions as a result of the accidental or intentional acts of Internet users, current and former employees or others. Such acts could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, such as credit card and bank account numbers, stored in our and our clients' computer systems. Such a breach in security could result in liability to us and in the loss of existing clients or the deterrence of potential clientsAlthough we plan to continue using industry-standard security measures, such measures have been circumvented in the past, and ours may be circumvented in the future. The costs required to eliminate computer viruses and alleviate other security problems could be prohibitively expensive, and efforts to address such problems could result in delays or interruption of service to our clients. These could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operationsIn the event our hardware malfunctions and our back-up systems fail, we may not be able to maintain our standard of service to our customers. In addition, each of our electronic commerce outsourcing centers has been configured to provide services that facilitate commerce and communication either between businesses and consumers, known as business-to-consumer services, or between businesses and their trading partners, known as business-to-business services, but not both. If we were unable to provide outsourcing services at one of our outsourcing centers, it would materially adversely impact our ability to continue to provide the type of electronic commerce outsourcing services processed through that center. We may be required to make additional investments in our electronic commerce outsourcing centers in order to increase capacity and respond to technological developments. OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ASSETS;AMORTIZATION OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR NET INCOME AND WE MAY NEVER REALIZE THE FULL VALUE OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS Our acquisitions have resulted in significant goodwill and other intangible assets, which are being amortized over various periods, primarily two to three years. At March 31, 1999, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $133.1 million, net of accumulated amortization. Charges we would have incurred in connection with the amortization of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 1998 and the three months ended March 31, 1999, after giving pro forma effect to the acquisitions we made in 1998 and 1999, would have decreased our net income by $49.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The amount of goodwill associated with the acquisitions we made in 1998 and 1999 may increase in the future as a result of a portion of the contingent purchase consideration that may become payable if the agreed-upon operating targets for the following four acquired companies are fully met: LOGEX International, L.L.C., New Media Publishing, Internet Outfitters and TransForm IT. The actual amount of goodwill that will be recorded will depend in part on the price per share of our common stock and such goodwill will be recorded through the end of the year 2000. We will continue to incur non-cash charges in connection with the amortization of our intangible assets over their respective useful lives, and we expect such charges will have a significant adverse impact on our net income for the foreseeable futureWe cannot assure you that we will ever realize the value of these intangible assets. In the future, as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our intangible assets may not be recoverable, we will evaluate the carrying value of our intangible assets and may take an additional charge to our earnings. Any future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a further discussion of our intangible assets. 10 THE YEAR 2000 PROBLEM MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSThe risks posed by the Year 2000 problem could adversely affect our business in a number of significant ways. Many of our clients and potential clients maintain their operations on systems that could be impacted by Year 2000 problems. If our clients fail to ensure their systems are Year 2000 compliant and Year 2000 problems materially adversely affect them, our business could be materially adversely affected, particularly if demand for our services declines while companies redirect their resources to upgrade their computer systems. We also depend heavily on the availability of the Internet infrastructure to conduct our business and provide services to our clients. Disruptions in the Internet infrastructure arising from Year 2000 problems could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operationsIn addition, our business could be materially adversely affected if we cannot obtain products, services or systems that are Year 2000 compliant when we need them. We rely on our suppliers for hardware, software and services. We are in the process of obtaining assurances from our suppliers that they are Year 2000 compliant. Our internal information systems may experience operations difficulties because of undetected errors or defects in the technology used. The expense to correct such defects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionBecause we provide computer-related services, the risk we will be involved in a lawsuit relating to Year 2000 issues is likely to be greater than that of companies in other industries. Because the solutions we deliver are sometimes dependent upon third-party products and components, it may be difficult to determine which component of our solution may cause a Year 2000 problem. As a result, we may become involved in litigation concerning our services or products and components of a third party. We sometimes provide an express warranty to clients that our work is Year 2000 compliant. However, even absent an express Year 2000 warranty, there is a risk that clients for whom we have provided services will try to hold us liable for damages caused by the Year 2000 problemWe cannot guarantee that we will be Year 2000 compliant in a timely manner. Moreover, the costs related to Year 2000 compliance could be significant. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a further discussion of the potential effects of the Year 2000 problem on our business. GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE INTERNET COULDADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS Increased regulation of the Internet might slow the growth in use of the Internet, which could decrease demand for our services, increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Congress has recently passed legislation regulating certain aspects of the Internet, including on-line content, children's protection, copyright infringement, user privacy, taxation, access charges, liability for third-party activities, transmission of sexually explicit material and jurisdiction. In addition, federal, state and local governmental organizations as well as foreign governments are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet. Areas of potential regulation include libel, pricing, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership. We do not know how courts will interpret laws governing the Internet or the extent to which they will apply existing laws regulating issues such as property ownership, libel and personal privacy to the Internet. Therefore, we are not certain how new laws governing the Internet or other existing laws will affect our business. APPNET IS CONTROLLED BY ITS SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDERSUpon completion of this offering, Ken Bajaj, AppNet's President and Chief Executive Officer, and GTCR will beneficially own 9.6% and 44.2%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. As a result, GTCR and Mr. Bajaj will be able to exercise a controlling influence over the outcome of matters 11 submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, appointment of new management, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and mergers or sales of all of our assets. GTCR and Mr. Bajaj will have the power to delay, defer or prevent a change in control of AppNet. See "Management--Board of Directors," "Principal Stockholders" and "Certain Relationships and Transactions" for a further discussion of Mr. Bajaj's and GTCR's ownership of our capital stock and their respective relationships with INVESTORS IN THIS OFFERING WILL EXPERIENCE IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE DILUTIONIf you purchase common stock in this offering, you will pay more for your shares than the amounts paid by existing stockholders for their shares. As a result you will experience immediate and complete dilution of approximately $12.12, representing the difference between our net tangible book value per share as of March 31, 1999, after giving pro forma effect to this offering, and the acquisitions we made in 1999. In addition, you may experience further dilution to the extent that shares of our common stock are issued upon the exercise of stock options and warrants, </td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS The following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this Prospectus before purchasing the shares of Common Stock offered hereby. This Prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Risk Factors below and elsewhere in this Prospectus. ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED IT PROFESSIONALSThe Company's success depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified IT professionals with the technical skills and experience necessary to meet its clients' requirements for technical personnel. Competition for individuals with proven technical skills, particularly in the Windows, Unix, CAD and other technology environments for which the Company provides services, is intense, and the Company expects that competition for IT professionals will increase in the future. Furthermore, IT professionals typically provide services on an assignment-by-assignment basis and can terminate an assignment with the Company at any time. The Company competes for such individuals with other providers of technical staffing services, systems integrators, providers of outsourcing services, computer consultants and temporary personnel agencies. Many of the IT professionals who work with the Company also work with the Company's competitors, and there can be no assurance that IT professionals currently working on projects for the Company will not choose to work for competitors on future assignments. There also can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain qualified IT professionals in sufficient numbers in the future. The Company's net revenues in any period are related, among other factors, to the number of IT professionals it has on staff and engaged on assignments. If the Company is unable to hire or retain such personnel, the Company's business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. See "Business--Business Strategy," "--IT Professionals" and "--Competition." RISKS INHERENT IN ADDITION OF PRACTICE GROUPS AND EXPANSION INTO NEW MARKETSThe Company's growth depends on its ability to successfully expand existing Practice Groups, add additional Practice Groups within its existing regional markets and enter new regional markets. This expansion is dependent on a number of factors, including the Company's ability to: attract, hire, integrate and retain qualified revenue generating employees; develop, recruit and maintain a base of qualified IT professionals within a regional market; accurately assess the demand of a new market; and initiate, develop and sustain corporate client relationships in each new regional market. There can be no assurance that the addition of Practice Groups and entrance into new regional markets will occur on a timely basis or achieve anticipated financial results. The addition of new Practice Groups and entrance into new regional markets typically results in increases in operating expenses, primarily due to increased headcount. Expenses are incurred in advance of forecasted revenue, and there is typically a delay before the Company's new recruiting personnel and sales employees reach full productivity. If the Company is unable to add Practice Groups or enter new regional markets in a cost-effective manner or if those Practice Groups and regional markets do not achieve anticipated financial results, the Company's business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Business-- Growth Strategy." FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS; SEASONALITYThe Company's quarterly operating results have in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly depending on a number of factors, including but not limited to: the rate of hiring and the productivity of revenue-generating personnel; the availability of qualified IT professionals; changes in the relative mix between the Company's contract services and permanent placement services; changes in the pricing of the Company's 7 services; the timing and rate of entrance into new regional markets and the addition of practice groups; departures or temporary absences of key revenue- generating personnel; the structure and timing of acquisitions; changes in the demand for IT professionals; and general economic factors. In addition, because the Company provides services on an assignment-by-assignment basis, which clients can terminate at any time, there can be no assurance that existing clients will continue to use the Company's services at historical levels. Although the impact of seasonal factors will vary, the Company experiences a certain amount of seasonality in its first quarter due primarily to the number of holidays and the number of internal training and incentive programs in the first quarter, which may reduce the number of days worked by IT professionals and revenue-generating employees during such quarter. As a result, the Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance. In the event the Company's operating results fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the price of the Company's Common Stock would likely be materially adversely affected. Although the Company has experienced substantial revenue growth in recent years, there can be no assurance that, in the future, the Company will sustain revenue growth or profitability on a quarterly or annual basis at historical levels. See "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." INTEGRATION OF TEAMALLIANCEIn December 1996, the Company acquired certain assets of TeamAlliance, which was comprised of six affiliated but separate entities that were located in five states. These management companies now operate as a separate practice group within the Company's Contract Services Division. The integration of TeamAlliance, its clients, IT professionals and employees has required a significant amount of management time and attention, and has resulted in significant integration-related expenses, including expenses associated with training TeamAlliance employees and relocating certain TeamAlliance offices. The Company expects that it may incur additional integration related expenses in future periods, and there can be no assurance that the integration of TeamAlliance will not involve disruptions or difficulties, such as departures of clients, IT professionals or employees, resulting in a material adverse impact on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNELThe Company's future business and operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of its key employees and senior management personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss or temporary absence of any of the Company's senior management, significant revenue generating employees, other key personnel and, in particular, Brenda C. Hall, its Chief Executive Officer, or the inability to attract and retain key employees or management personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. See "Management." MANAGEMENT OF GROWTHThe Company has recently experienced a period of rapid growth that has placed and will continue to place significant demands upon its management and other resources. The Company's net revenues increased 72.1% from $29.4 million in 1995 to $50.6 million in 1996, while headcount increased from 141 employees to 327 employees in the same period. The Company's ability to effectively manage future growth will require the Company to expand its operational, financial and other internal systems. Implementing a new or expanded financial and management information system can be time-consuming and expensive and require significant management resources. There can be no assurance that the Company's current personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support the Company's future operations or that any new system can be implemented effectively. Any failure to manage its growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. See "Business--Growth Strategy." 8 RISKS OF ACQUISITIONSA component of the Company's growth strategy is the acquisition of complementary businesses. The successful implementation of this strategy is dependent upon the Company's ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, obtain requisite financing, acquire such companies on suitable terms and integrate their operations successfully with those of the Company. To date, the Company has completed one acquisition and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition candidates or that the Company will be able to acquire such candidates on favorable terms. Moreover, other providers of IT professional services are also competing for acquisition candidates, which could result in an increase in the price of acquisition targets and a diminished pool of companies available for acquisition. Acquisitions also involve a number of other risks, including adverse effects on the Company's reported operating results from increases in amortized goodwill and interest expense, the diversion of management attention and the subsequent integration of acquired businesses. To the extent the Company seeks to acquire complementary businesses for cash, the Company may be required to obtain additional financing and there can be no assurance such financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Due to all of the foregoing, acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if the Company issues stock to complete any future acquisitions, existing stockholders will experience further ownership dilution. See "Business--Growth Strategy." INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONThe Company's business is dependent on the trends prevalent in, and the continued growth and rate of change of, the high technology industry. In 1996, substantially all of the Company's net revenues were derived by providing services to clients in the high technology industry. In addition, approximately 73.2% of the Company's net revenues in 1996 were derived from services provided to clients located in Silicon Valley (56.9% on a pro forma basis for the TeamAlliance Acquisition). A substantial deterioration in general economic conditions in Silicon Valley or in the high technology industry as a whole would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and operating results. See "Business--Clients." HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETThe IT staffing industry is highly competitive and fragmented and has low barriers to entry. The Company competes for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants, other providers of IT staffing services and temporary personnel agencies. Many of the Company's current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and marketing resources, greater name recognition and a larger installed base of IT professionals and clients than the Company. In addition, many of these competitors, including numerous smaller privately held companies, may be able to respond more quickly to customer requirements and to devote greater resources to the marketing of services than the Company. Because there are relatively low barriers to entry, the Company expects that competition will increase in the future. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. Further, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition. See "Business--Competition." CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERSUpon completion of this Offering, the Company's principal stockholders, Brenda C. Hall, Todd J. Kinion and entities affiliated with the Sprout Group, will beneficially own approximately 70.6% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock (approximately 66.5% if the over-allotment option is exercised in full). As a result, these stockholders as a group will be able to exercise control over almost all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of the 9 Company and may discourage third parties from attempting to do so. See "Management" and "Principal and Selling Stockholders." LIABILITY RISKSThe Company is exposed to liability with respect to actions taken by its IT professionals while on assignment, such as damages caused by errors of IT professionals, misuse of client proprietary information or theft of client property. The Company often indemnifies its clients from the foregoing. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage, due to the nature of the Company's assignments, and in particular the access by IT professionals to client information systems and confidential information, and the potential liability with respect thereto, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or that it will be adequate to cover any such liability. The Company may be exposed to claims of discrimination and harassment and other similar claims as a result of inappropriate actions allegedly taken against IT professionals by corporate clients. As an employer, the Company is also exposed to possible claims of wrongful discharge and violations of immigration laws. Employment related claims may result in negative publicity, litigation and liability for money damages and fines. See "Business--Employees." SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE; REGISTRATION RIGHTSSales of substantial numbers of shares of Common Stock in the public market after the Offering could adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. Upon completion of the Offering, the Company will have outstanding 8,866,955 shares of Common Stock. All of the 2,515,000 shares sold in this Offering will be freely transferable as of the date of this Prospectus by persons other than "affiliates" of the Company without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and an additional 28,550 shares held by an existing shareholder will be eligible for sale in the public market in reliance on Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act. The remaining 6,323,405 shares of Common Stock that will be outstanding upon completion of this Offering (the "Restricted Shares") will be held by officers, directors, employees, IT professionals and other stockholders of the Company. The Restricted Shares were sold by the Company in reliance upon exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and are "restricted securities" under the Securities Act. Beginning 90 days after the date of this Prospectus, 46,048 shares will be eligible for sale in the public market subject to Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. Certain holders of Restricted Shares have agreed not to sell their shares without the prior written consent of Montgomery Securities for a period of 180 days from the date of this Prospectus. Beginning 180 days after commencement of the Offering unless earlier released, in whole or in part, by Montgomery Securities, 6,277,357 Restricted Shares that are subject to lock-up agreements will become eligible for sale in the public market subject to Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. As of June 30, 1997, 2,438,186 shares were issuable upon exercise of currently outstanding options. Certain holders of such options have agreed pursuant to existing agreements with the Company not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any Common Stock for a period of 180 days from the date of this Prospectus. In addition, certain holders of such options have additionally agreed not to sell any Common Stock acquired without the prior written consent of Montgomery Securities for a period of 180 days from the date of this Prospectus. As of June 30, 1997, 250,000 shares were issuable upon exercise of currently outstanding warrants, all of which are also subject to the lock-up agreements described above and will become eligible for sale in the public markets subject to Rule 144 beginning 180 days after commencement of this Offering unless earlier released, in whole or in part, by Montgomery Securities. Upon completion of this Offering, certain holders of 5,886,221 shares of Common Stock and securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock have certain registration rights under a registration rights agreement among such holders and the Company and certain other agreements. In addition, following completion of the Offering, the Company intends to register under the Securities Act approximately 3,238,186 shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding stock options or reserved for issuance under the Company's 1997 Stock Option Plan, IT Professional Stock Option Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Stock Plans") as well as stock options granted outside the Stock Plans. See "Management--1997 Stock Option Plan," "-- IT Professional Plan," "--Employee Stock Purchase Plan," "Principal and Selling Stockholders," "Description of Capital Stock--Registration Rights," "Shares Eligible for Future Sale" and "Underwriting." 10 NO PRIOR TRADING MARKET FOR COMMON STOCK; POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICEPrior to this Offering, there has been no public market for the Company's Common Stock. There can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop or be sustained after this Offering or that the market price of the Company's Common Stock will not fall below the offering price. The initial public offering price was determined through negotiations among the Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Representatives of the Underwriters based on several factors and may not be indicative of the market price of the Common Stock after this Offering. The market price of the shares of Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company's operating results, announcements of acquisitions by the Company or its competitors, conditions or trends in the IT staffing industry or in technology stocks generally, adoption of new tax and accounting standards affecting the IT staffing industry, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, general market conditions and other factors. In addition, the technology sector of the stock market has experienced in recent years significant price and volume fluctuations. Because the Company's business is dependent on the trends prevalent in, and the continued growth and rate of change of, the high technology industry, these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company's Common Stock following this Offering. See "-- Industry and Geographic Concentration" and "Underwriting." EFFECT OF CERTAIN CHARTER PROVISIONS; ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS, DELAWARE LAWUpon completion of this Offering, the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate") and Bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an unsolicited change in control of the Company, which may adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock or the ability of shareholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price. Such provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in the management of the Company. These provisions provide that all stockholder action must be taken at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders, that only the Board of Directors may call special meetings of the stockholders and that the Board of Directors be divided into three classes to serve for staggered three-year terms. In addition, the Certificate authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock ("Preferred Stock") without shareholder approval and on such terms as the Board of Directors may determine. Although no shares of Preferred Stock will be outstanding upon the closing of this Offering and the Company has no present plans to issue any shares of Preferred Stock, the rights of the holders of Common Stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any Preferred Stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, the Company is subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company. See "Description of Capital Stock--Preferred Stock" and "--Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware Law." IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTIONInvestors participating in this Offering will incur immediate, substantial dilution in net tangible book value per share of $12.67 from the initial public offering price per share. To the extent outstanding options or warrants to purchase the Company's Common Stock are exercised, there will be further dilution. See "Dilution." 11</td>

that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our business and industry our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business and may result in decreases in the price of our common stock. our quarterly and annual results of operations, including our revenues, profitability and cash flow may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. accordingly, the results of any one quarter or period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. our quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. fluctuation in quarterly and annual results may negatively impact the value of our common

with existing clients; client renewal rates; changes in strategic and client relationships; the timing and success of new product and feature introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, clients or strategic partners; network outages or security breaches, which may result in lost clients, client credits and harm to our reputation; inaccessibility or failure of our cloud contact center software due to failures in the products or services provided by third parties; the timing of recognition of revenues; the amount and timing of costs and expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; increases or decreases in the elements of our solution or pricing changes upon any renewals of client agreements; changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; the level of professional services and support we provide to clients; the

training and retention of key employees; 11 litigation or other claims against us; our ability to obtain additional financing; and advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards.if we are unable to attract new clients or sell additional services and functionality to our existing clients, our revenue and revenue growth will be harmed. to increase our revenue, we must add new clients, encourage existing clients to renew their subscriptions on terms favorable to us and to add additional agent seats and sell additional functionality to existing clients. as our industry matures, or as competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete favorably with ours, our ability to add new clients and renew or upsell existing clients based on pricing, technology and functionality could be impaired. as a result, we may be unable to renew our agreements with existing clients or attract new clients or new business from existing clients, which could harm our revenue and growth. a portion of our revenue is generated by acquiring domestic and international telecommunications minutes from wholesale telecommunication service providers and reselling those minutes to our clients. we must resell more minutes if telecommunications rates decrease to maintain our level of usage revenue.our recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may fail to manage our growth effectively. for the years ended december31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, our revenue was $43.2 million, $63.8million and $84.1million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 48% and 32%, respectively. we expect that, in the future, as our revenue increases, our revenue growth rate may decline. we believe growth of our revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to: capture market share from providers of legacy on-premise contact center systems as contact center systems are refreshed; attract new clients, increase our existing clients use of our solution and further develop our partner ecosystem; introduce our solution to new markets outside of the united states and increase global awareness of our brand; strengthen and improve our solution through significant investments in research and development; and selectively pursue acquisitions. if we are not successful in achieving these objectives, our revenue may be harmed. in addition, we plan to continue our investment in future growth, including expending substantial financial and other resources on: sales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our sales organization; our technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, management tools, scalability, availability, performance and security, as well as disaster recovery measures; solution development, including investments in our solution development team and the development of new applications and features for existing solutions; international expansion; and general administration, including legal and accounting expenses related to being a public company. moreover, we have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations. in particular, we grew from 332 employees as of december31, 2011, to 442 employees as of december31, 2012, to 533employees as of december31, 2013. we have also significantly increased the size of our client base to over 12 2,000clients. we anticipate that we will significantly expand our operations and headcount in the near term. this growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively. to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in adding new clients, declines in quality or client satisfaction, increases in costs, system failures, difficulties in introducing new features or solutions or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could harm our business performance and results of operations. the expected addition of new employees and the capital investments that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth will make it more difficult for us to generate earnings or offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing costs and expenses in the short term. if we fail to manage our anticipated growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan successfully.the markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for contact center solutions is highly competitive. our clients are not subject to long-term contractual commitments to purchase our solution and can terminate our service and switch to competitors offerings on short notice. we currently compete with large legacy technology vendors that offer on-premise enterprise telephony and contact center systems, such as avaya inc., or avaya, and cisco systems, inc., or cisco, and legacy on-premise software companies that come from a computer telephony integration, or cti, heritage, such as aspect software, inc., or aspect, genesys telecommunications laboratories, inc., or genesys, and interactive intelligence group, inc., or interactive intelligence. these companies are supplementing their traditional on-premise contact center systems with cloud offerings, either through acquisition or in-house development. additionally, we compete with vendors that historically provided other contact center services and technologies and expanded to offer cloud contact center software. these companies include incontact, inc., or incontact, and liveops, inc., or liveops. we also face competition from smaller contact center service providers with specialized contact center software offerings. our actual and potential competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial or technical resources. with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. some of our competitors can devote significantly greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services and many have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. current or potential competitors may also be acquired by third parties with significantly greater resources. in addition, many of our competitors have stronger name recognition, longer operating histories, established relationships with clients, more comprehensive product offerings, larger installed bases and major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product offerings or resources. if our competitors products, services or technologies become more accepted than our solution, if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours, or if their products or services are less expensive or more technologically capable than ours, then our revenues could be harmed. pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins and loss of, or a failure to maintain or improve, our competitive market position, any of which could harm our business.if we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure, our existing clients may experience service outages, our new clients may experience delays in the deployment of our solution and we could be subject to, among other things, claims for credits or damages. our success depends in large part upon the capacity, stability and performance of our operations infrastructure. from time to time, we have experienced interruptions in service, and may experience such interruptions in the future. for example, on march20, 2014, we experienced an extended interruption in service due to an issue with third-party equipment that affected our santa clara, california colocation facility. 13 consistent with prior service interruptions, we anticipate that we will issue client credits and, therefore, revenue for the quarter ending march31, 2014 will be impacted. while we cannot currently quantify the impact this interruption will have on our revenue, the impact will likely result in our revenue for the quarter ending march31, 2014 being slightly below our revenue for the quarter ended december31, 2013. this interruption in service does not impact revenue previously reported for any prior period. these service interruptions may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, fraud, spikes in client usage and denial of service issues. in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. our failure to achieve or maintain expected performance levels, stability and security could harm our relationships with our clients, result in claims for credits or damages, damage our reputation and significantly reduce client demand for our solution and harm our business. any future service interruptions could: cause our clients to seek credits or damages for losses incurred; require us to replace existing equipment; affect our reputation as a reliable service provider; cause existing clients to cancel or elect not to renew their contracts; or make it more difficult for us to attract new clients or expand our business with existing clients. we have experienced significant growth in the number of agents and interactions that our infrastructure supports. as our client base grows and their use of our service increases, we will be required to make additional investments in our capacity to maintain adequate stability and performance, the availability of which may be limited or the cost of which may be prohibitive. in addition, we need to properly manage our operations infrastructure in order to support version control, changes in hardware and software parameters and the evolution of our solution. if we do not accurately predict or improve our infrastructure requirements to keep pace with growth in our business, our business could be harmed.if our dollar-based retention rate declines, our revenues, gross margins and net income could decrease and we may be required to spend more money to grow our client base and maintain our revenues. we calculate our dollar-based retention rate by dividing our retained net invoicing by our retention base net invoicing on a monthly basis, which we then average using the rates for the trailing twelve months for the period being presented. we define retention base net invoicing as recurring net invoicing from all clients in the comparable prior year period, and we define retained net invoicing as recurring net invoicing from that same group of clients in the current period. we define recurring net invoicing as subscription and related usage revenue excluding the impact of service credits, reserves and deferrals. historically, recurring net invoicing has been within 10% of our subscription and related usage revenue. we analyze our dollar-based retention rate data to gain insight into our ability to retain and grow revenue from our clients and measure the long-term value of our client relationships. we offer both annual and monthly contracts to our clients, with 30 days notice required for changes in the number of agent seats. our clients can use this notice period to rapidly adjust the number of agent seats used to meet their changing contact center volume needs, including to reduce the number of agent seats to zero. as a general matter, this means that a client can effectively terminate its agreement with us upon 30days notice. as a result, our dollar-based retention rate could decrease in the future if clients are not satisfied with our service, competition increases from other contact center providers, we experience system outages, alternative technologies emerge, the u.s. or global economy declines or due to many other factors. if our dollar-based retention rate decreases, we will need to acquire new clients to maintain our existing level of revenues. there can be no assurance that the market for our solution will continue to grow or that we will not lose market share to current or future competitors, either of which would magnify the impact of any decrease in our dollar-based retention rate. we incur significant costs and expenses, including sales and marketing expenses, to acquire new clients, and those costs and expenses are an important factor in determining our net profitability. therefore, if we are unsuccessful in maintaining our dollar-based retention rate or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new clients, our revenues, gross margins and net income could decrease. we sell our solution to larger organizations that require longer sales and implementation cycles and often demand more configuration and integration services or customized features and functions that we may not offer, any of which could delay or prevent these sales and harm our growth rates, business and operating results. as we target our sales efforts at larger organizations, we face greater costs, longer sales and implementation cycles and less predictability in completing our sales. these larger organizations typically require more configuration and integration services, which increases our upfront investment in sales and deployment efforts, with no guarantee that these clients will subscribe to our solution or increase the scope of their subscription. furthermore, with larger organizations, we must provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our solution to a broader group of people. as a result of these factors, we must devote a significant amount of sales support and professional services resources to individual clients, thereby increasing the cost and time required to complete sales. our typical sales cycle for larger organizations is four to five months, but can be significantly longer, and we expect that our average sales cycle may increase as sales to larger organizations continue to grow as a percentage of our business. longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to be less predictable and to fluctuate from period to period. in addition, many of our clients that are larger organizations initially deploy our solution to support only a portion of their contact center agents. our success depends on our ability to increase the number of agent seats and the number of applications utilized by larger organizations over time. there is no guarantee that these clients will increase their subscriptions for our solution. if we do not expand our initial relationships with larger organizations, the return on our investments in sales and deployment efforts for these clients will decrease and our business may suffer. furthermore, we may not be able to provide the configuration and integration services that larger organizations typically require. for example, our solution does not currently permit clients to add new data fields and functions or modify our code. if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer, and that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves, then we may lose sales opportunities with larger organizations and our business could suffer.because most of our revenue is derived from existing clients, downturns or upturns in new sales will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern. we generally recognize subscription revenue from clients monthly as services are delivered. as a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is derived from existing clients. consequently, a decline in new subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small impact on our revenue results for that quarter. however, the cumulative impact of such declines could harm our revenues in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solution, and potential changes in our pricing policies or renewal rates, will typically not be reflected in our results of operations until future periods. we also may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenue, resulting in lower margins and earnings. in addition, our subscription model makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new clients will be recognized over time as services are delivered. for example, many of our clients initially deploy our solution to support only a portion of their contact center agents. any increase to our revenue and the value of these existing client relationships will only be reflected in our results of operations as these clients increase the number of agent seats and the number of applications utilized with our solution over time as they experience the benefits of our cloud solution.we rely on third-party telecommunications and internet service providers to provide our clients and their customers with telecommunication services and connectivity to our cloud contact center software and any failure by these service providers to provide reliable services could subject us to, among other things, claims for credits or damages. we rely on third-party telecommunication service providers to provide our clients and their customers with telecommunication services. these telephony services include the public switched telephone network, or pstn, telephone numbers, call termination and origination services, and local number portability for our clients. in addition, we depend on our internet bandwidth suppliers to provide uninterrupted and error-free service through their telecommunications networks. we exercise little control over these third-party providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. if any of these service providers fail to provide 15 reliable services, or terminate or increase the cost of the services that we and our clients depend on, we may be required to switch to another service provider. delays caused by switching our technology to another service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service provider could materially harm our client relationships, business, financial condition and operating results. due to our reliance on these service providers, when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. service disruption or outages, whether caused by our service, the products or services of our third-party service providers, or our clients or their customers equipment and systems, may result in loss of market acceptance of our solution and any necessary repairs or other remedial actions may force us to incur significant costs and expenses. any failure on the part of third-party service providers to achieve or maintain expected performance levels, stability and security could harm our relationships with our clients, result in claims for credits or damages, damage our reputation, significantly reduce client demand for our solution and seriously harm our financial condition and operating results.we have a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. we have incurred significant losses in each period since our inception in 2001. we incurred net losses of $7.9 million in the year ended december31, 2011, $19.3 million in the year ended december31, 2012 and $31.3million in the year ended december31, 2013. as of december31, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of $90.8million. these losses and our accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we have made to develop our solution and acquire new clients. we expect our costs and expenses to increase in the future due to anticipated increases in cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses and, therefore, we expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to make significant future expenditures to develop and expand our business. furthermore, to the extent we are successful in increasing our client base, we may also incur increased losses because costs associated with acquiring clients are generally incurred up front, while revenues are recognized over the course of the client relationship. historically, we also have experienced negative gross margins on our professional services, which are expected to continue in the future. in addition, as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. you should not consider our recent growth in revenues as necessarily indicative of our future performance. accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future nor that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability.if the market for cloud contact center software solutions develops more slowly than we expect or declines, our business could be harmed. the cloud contact center software solutions market is not as mature as the market for legacy on-premise contact center systems, and it is uncertain whether cloud contact center solutions will achieve and sustain high levels of client demand and market acceptance. our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud contact center software solutions as a replacement for legacy on-premise systems. many larger organizations have invested substantial technical, personnel and financial resources to integrate legacy on-premise contact center systems into their businesses and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloud contact center solutions such as ours. it is difficult to predict client adoption rates and demand for our solution, the future growth rate and size of the cloud contact center software market, or the entry of competitive products and services. the expansion of the cloud contact center software solutions market depends on a number of factors, including the refresh rate for legacy on-premise systems, cost, performance and perceived value associated with cloud contact center software solutions, as well as the ability of providers of cloud contact center software solutions to address security, stability and privacy concerns. if other cloud contact center solution providers experience security incidents, loss of client data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for cloud contact center software products, solutions and services as a whole, including our solution, may be harmed. if cloud contact center software solutions do not achieve widespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand for such solutions caused by a lack of client acceptance, enhanced product offerings from on-premise providers, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, it could result in decreased revenues and our business could be harmed. shifts over time or from quarter-to-quarter in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our solution or changes in the components of our solution purchased by our clients could harm our operating results. our strategy is to sell our solution to both smaller and larger organizations. our gross margins can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our solution, including the features and number of agent seats purchased by our clients and the level of usage and professional services and support required by our clients. for example, our larger clients typically require more professional services and because our professional services offerings typically have negative margins, any increase in sales of professional services could harm our gross margins and operating results. sales to larger organizations may also entail longer sales cycles and more significant selling efforts. selling to smaller clients may involve lower dollar-based retention rates, smaller contract sizes and greater credit risk and uncertainty. if the mix of organizations that purchase our solution changes, or the mix of solution components purchased by our clients, changes, our revenues and gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be harmed.we depend on data centers operated by third parties and any disruption in the operation of these facilities could harm our business. we host our solution at data centers located in santa clara, california and atlanta, georgia. any failure or downtime in one of our data center facilities could affect a significant percentage of our clients. while we control and have access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities. the owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. if we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, closes, suffers financial difficulty or is unable to meet our growing capacity needs, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and service interruptions in connection with doing so. our data centers are subject to various points of failure. problems with cooling equipment, generators, uninterruptible power supply, routers, switches, or other equipment, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions for our clients as well as equipment damage. our data centers are subject to disasters such as earthquakes, floods, fires, hurricanes, acts of terrorism, sabotage, break-ins, acts of vandalism and other events, which could cause service interruptions or the operators of these data centers to close their facilities for an extended period of time or permanently. the destruction or impairment of any of our data center facilities could result in significant downtime for our solution and the loss of client data. because our ability to attract and retain clients depends on our providing clients with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions in our service could harm our business, revenues and reputation. additionally, in connection with the continuing expansion of our existing data center facilities, there is an increased risk that service interruptions may occur as a result of server addition, relocation or other issues. in addition, our data centers are subject to increased costs of power. we may not be able to pass on any increase in costs of energy to our clients, which could reduce our operating margins.our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate and predict our current business and future prospects. we have been in existence since 2001, and much of our growth has occurred in recent periods. our limited operating history and recent growth may make it difficult for you to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including increasing and unforeseen expenses as we continue to grow our business. our ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to adjustments in our markets, or if we do not address these 17 risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.if our solution fails to perform properly or if it contains technical defects, our reputation could be harmed, our market share may decline and we could be subject to product liability claims. our solution may contain undetected errors or defects that may result in failures or otherwise cause our solution to fail to perform in accordance with client expectations. because our clients use our solution for mission-critical aspects of their business, any errors or defects in, or other performance problems with, our solution may damage our clients businesses and could significantly harm our reputation. if that occurs, we could lose future sales, or our existing clients could elect to cancel or not renew our solution, seek payment credits or delay or withhold payment to us, which could result in reduced revenues, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts and service credits and an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable. clients also m</td>

in this prospectus, before making an investment decision to purchase our common stock. the realization of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and the market price and liquidity of our common stock, which could cause you to lose all or a significant part of your investment in our common stock. some statements in this prospectus, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. please refer to the section entitled "forward-looking statements." risks relating to our businessthe loss of or changes in our relationships with gses, hud and institutional investors would adversely affect our ability to originate commercial real estate loans through gse and hud programs, which would materially and adversely affect us. currently, we originate substantially all of our loans for sale through gse or hud programs. we are approved as a fannie mae dus lender nationwide, a freddie mac program plus lender in seven states, the district of columbia and the metropolitan new york area, a hud map lender nationwide, and a ginnie mae issuer. our status as an approved lender affords us a number of advantages and may be terminated by the applicable gse or hud at any time. the loss of such status would, or changes in our relationships could, prevent us from being able to originate commercial real estate loans for sale through the particular gse or hud, which would materially and adversely affect us. it could also result in a loss of similar approvals from other gses or hud. we also originate loans on behalf of certain life insurance companies, investment banks, commercial banks, pension funds and other institutional investors that directly underwrite and provide funding for the loans at closing. in cases where we do not fund the loan, we act as a loan broker. if these investors discontinue their relationship with us and replacement investors cannot be found on a timely basis, we could be adversely affected.a change to the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac and related actions, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between fannie mae and freddie mac and the u.s. federal government, could materially and adversely affect our business. there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the future of fannie mae and freddie mac, including whether they both will continue to exist in their current form. due to increased market concerns about the ability of fannie mae and freddie mac to withstand future credit losses associated with securities on which they provide guarantees and loans held in their investment portfolios without the direct support of the u.s. federal government, in september 2008, the federal housing finance agency (the "fhfa") placed fannie mae and freddie mac into conservatorship and, together with the u.s. treasury, established a program designed to boost investor confidence in fannie mae and freddie mac by supporting the availability of mortgage financing and protecting taxpayers. the u.s. government program includes contracts between the u.s. treasury and each of fannie mae and freddie mac that seek to ensure that each gse maintains a positive net worth by providing for the provision of cash by the u.s. treasury to fannie mae and freddie mac if fhfa determines that its liabilities exceed its assets. although the u.s. government has described some specific steps that it intends to take as part of the conservatorship process, efforts to stabilize these entities may not be successful and the outcome and impact of these events remain highly uncertain. the problems faced by fannie mae and freddie mac resulting in their placement into conservatorship and their delistings from the new york stock exchange have stirred debate among some u.s. federal policymakers regarding the continued role of the u.s. government in providing liquidity for mortgage loans. future legislation could further change the relationship between fanniemae and freddie mac and the u.s. government, could change their business charters or structure, or could nationalize or eliminate such entities entirely. we cannot predict whether, or when any such legislation may be enacted. in june 2009, as part of the obama administration's financial industry recovery proposal, the u.s. treasury announced that it and hud, in consultation with other government agencies, plan to engage in a wide-ranging initiative to develop recommendations on the future of fannie mae and freddie mac and the federal home loan bank system. the u.s. treasury noted that there are a number of options for the reform of fannie mae and freddie mac, including: (i)returning them to their previous status as government-sponsored enterprises with the paired interests of maximizing returns for private shareholders and pursuing public policy home ownership goals; (ii)gradual wind-down of their operations and liquidation of their assets; (iii)incorporating each of fannie mae's and freddie mac's function into a federal agency; (iv)creating a public utility model where the government regulates fannie mae's and freddie mac's profit margin, sets guarantee fees and provides explicit backing for guarantee commitments; (v)a conversion to providing insurance for covered bonds; and (vi)the dissolution of fannie mae and freddie mac into many smaller companies. treasury secretary geithner testified in march 2010 that the administration expects to present its proposals for housing finance reform to congress "next year." on april14, 2010, the obama administration released seven broad questions for public comment on the future of the housing finance system, including fannie mae and freddie mac, and announced that it would hold a series of public forums across the country on housing finance reform. on august17, 2010, the u.s. treasury and hud hosted the obama administration's "conference on the future of housing finance" to bring together academic experts, consumer and community organizations, industry groups, market participants and other stakeholders for an open discussion about housing finance reform. no definitive decisions were made at the conference. it is widely anticipated that the u.s. congress will address gses as part of its next major legislative undertaking, although it is not known when, or if, that will occur. in section1491 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd-frank act"), signed into law on july21, 2010, congress stated that the "hybrid public-private status of fannie mae and freddie mac is untenable and must be resolved" and, further, "[i]t is the sense of the congress that efforts to enhance by [sic] the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential mortgage credit and the practices related to such credit would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural reforms of fannie mae and freddie mac." currently, we originate a substantial majority of our loans for sale through fannie mae and freddie mac programs. furthermore, a substantial majority of our servicing rights derive from loans we sell through fannie mae and freddie mac programs. changes in the business charters, structure or existence of fannie mae or freddie mac could eliminate or substantially reduce the number of loans we originate, which would have a material adverse effect on us.we are subject to risk of loss in connection with defaults on loans sold under the fannie mae dus program that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. under the fannie mae dus program, we originate and service multifamily loans for fannie mae without having to obtain fannie mae's prior approval for certain loans, as long as the loans meet the underwriting guidelines set forth by fannie mae. in return for the delegated authority to make loans and the commitment to purchase loans by fannie mae, we must maintain minimum collateral and generally are required to share risk of loss on loans sold through fannie mae. under the full risk-sharing formula, we are required to absorb the first 5% of any losses on the unpaid principal balance of a loan, and above 5% we are required to share the loss with fannie mae, with our maximum loss capped at 20% of the unpaid principal balance of a loan. our risk-sharing obligations have been modified and reduced on some fannie mae dus loans. in addition, fannie mae can double or triple our risk-sharing obligations if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if the loan defaults within 12months of its sale to fannie mae. in september 2010, we received notice from fannie mae that our risk-sharing obligation has been increased on a $4.6million loan that defaulted within 12months of the sale to fannie mae. we have recommended that fannie mae initiate foreclosure on the defaulted loan. we are currently evaluating our collateral level on the fannie mae loan, but do not currently expect to incur a loss from this default. as of september30, 2010, we had pledged securities of $13.6million as collateral against future losses under $6.5billion of fannie mae dus loans outstanding that are subject to risk-sharing obligations, as more fully described under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resourcescredit quality and allowance for risk-sharing obligations," which we refer to as our "at risk balance." as of september30, 2010, our allowance for risk-sharing as a percentage of the at risk balance was 0.12%, or $7.8million, and reflects our current estimate of our future payouts under our risk-sharing obligations. we cannot assure you that our estimate will be sufficient to cover future write offs. while we originate loans that meet the underwriting guidelines defined by fannie mae, in addition to our own internal underwriting guidelines, underwriting criteria may not always protect against loan defaults. in addition, commercial real estate values have generally declined in recent years, in some cases to levels below the current outstanding principal balance of the loan. also, underwriting standards, including loan-to-value ratios, have become stricter. these factors create a risk that some older loans may not be able to be refinanced at maturity and thus may experience maturity defaults. other factors may also affect a borrower's decision to default on a loan, such as property, cash flow, occupancy, maintenance needs, and other financing obligations. as of september30, 2010, our 60 or more days delinquency rate was 0.83% of the fannie mae dus at risk portfolio. if loan defaults continue to increase, actual risk-sharing obligation payments under the fannie mae dus program may increase, and such defaults and payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. in addition, any failure to pay our share of losses under the fannie mae dus program could result in the revocation of our license from fannie mae and the exercise of various remedies available to fannie mae under the fannie mae dus program.if we fail to act proactively with delinquent borrowers in an effort to avoid a default, the number of delinquent loans could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on us. as a loan servicer, we maintain the primary contact with the borrower throughout the life of the loan and are responsible, pursuant to our servicing agreements with gses, hud and institutional investors, for asset management. we are also responsible, together with the applicable gse, hud or institutional investor, for taking actions to mitigate losses. we believe we have developed an extensive asset management process for tracking each loan that we service. however, we may be unsuccessful in identifying loans that are in danger of underperforming or defaulting or in taking appropriate action once those loans are identified. while we can recommend a loss mitigation strategy for gses and hud, decisions regarding loss mitigation are within the control of gses and hud. recent turmoil in the real estate, credit and capital markets have made this process even more difficult and unpredictable. when loans become delinquent, we incur additional expenses in servicing and asset managing the loan, we are typically required to advance principal and interest payments and tax and insurance escrow amounts, we could be subject to a loss of our contractual servicing fee and we could suffer losses of up to 20% (or more for loans that do not meet specific underwriting criteria or default within 12months) of the unpaid principal balance of a fannie mae dus loan with full risk-sharing, as well as potential losses on fannie mae dus loans with modified risk-sharing. these items could have a negative impact on our cash flows and a negative effect on the net carrying value of the msr on our balance sheet and could result in a charge to our earnings. as a result of the foregoing, a continuing rise in delinquencies could have a material adverse effect on us. a reduction in the prices paid for our loans and services or an increase in loan or security interest rates by investors could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. our results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected if gses, hud or institutional investors lower the price they are willing to pay to us for our loans or services or adversely change the material terms of their loan purchases or service arrangements with us. a number of factors determine the price we receive for our loans. with respect to fannie mae related originations, our loans are generally sold as fannie mae-insured securities to third-party investors. with respect to hud related originations, our loans are generally sold as ginnie mae securities to third-party investors. in both cases, the price paid to us reflects, in part, the competitive market bidding process for these securities. we sell loans directly to freddie mac. freddie mac may choose to hold, sell or later securitize such loans. we believe terms set by freddie mac are influenced by similar market factors as those that impact the price of fannie maeinsured or ginnie mae securities, although the pricing process differs. with respect to loans that are placed with institutional investors, the origination fees that we receive from borrowers are determined through negotiations, competition and other market conditions. loan servicing fees are based, in part, on the risk-sharing obligations associated with the loan and the market pricing of credit risk. the credit risk premium offered by fannie mae for new loans can change periodically but remains fixed once we enter into a commitment to sell the loan. over the past several years, fannie mae loan servicing fees have been higher due to the market pricing of credit risk. there can be no assurance that such fees will continue to remain at such levels or that such levels will be sufficient if delinquencies occur. servicing fees for loans placed with institutional investors are negotiated with each institutional investor pursuant to agreements that we have with them. these fees for new loans vary over time and may be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, including competitors that may be willing to provide similar services at better rates.we originate mostly multifamily and other commercial real estate loans that are eligible for sale through gse or hud programs, which focus may expose us to greater risk if the cmbs market recovers or alternative sources of liquidity become more readily available to the commercial real estate finance market. we originate mostly multifamily and other commercial real estate loans that are eligible for sale through gse or hud programs. over the past few years, the number of multifamily loans financed by gse and hud programs has represented a significantly greater percentage of overall multifamily loan origination volume than in prior years. we believe that this increase is the result, in part, of market dislocation and illiquidity in the secondary markets for non-gse or hud loans. to the extent the cmbs market recovers or liquidity in the commercial real estate finance market significantly increases, there may be less demand for loans that are eligible for sale through gse or hud programs, and our loan origination volume may be adversely impacted, which could materially and adversely affect us.a significant portion of our revenue is derived from loan servicing fees, and declines in or terminations of servicing engagements or breaches of servicing agreements, including as a result of non-performance by third parties that we engage for back-office loan servicing functions, could have a material adverse effect onus. for the year ended december31, 2009, 24% of our revenues were from loan servicing fees. we expect that loan servicing fees will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. nearly all of these fees are derived from loans that we originate and sell through gse and hud programs or place with institutional investors. a decline in the number or value of loans that we originate for these investors or terminations of our servicing engagements will decrease these fees. hud has the right to terminate our current servicing engagements for cause. in addition to termination for cause, fannie mae and freddie mac may terminate our servicing engagements without cause by paying a termination fee. our institutional investors typically may terminate our servicing engagements at any time with or without cause, without paying a termination fee. we are also subject to losses that may arise as a result of servicing errors, such as a failure to maintain insurance, pay taxes or provide notices. in addition, we have contracted with a third party to perform certain routine back-office aspects of loan servicing. if we or this third party fails to perform, or we breach or the third-party causes us to breach our servicing obligations to gses, hud and institutional investors, our servicing engagements may be terminated. declines or terminations of servicing engagements or breaches of such obligations could materially and adversely affect us.if one or more of our warehouse facilities, on which we are highly dependent, are terminated, we may be unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on us. we require a significant amount of funding capacity on an interim basis for loans we originate. as of september30, 2010, we had $300million of committed loan funding available through two commercial banks, $250million of uncommitted funding available through fannie mae as soon as pooled ("asap") program, and an unlimited amount of uncommitted funding available for fannie mae and freddie mac loans through kemps landing capital company,llc, an affiliate of guggenheim partners. consistent with industry practice, three of our existing warehouse facilities are short-term, requiring annual renewal. if any of our committed facilities are terminated or are not renewed or our uncommitted facilities are not honored, we may be unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, and we might not be able to originate loans, which would have a material adverse effect on us. if we fail to meet or satisfy any of the financial or other covenants included in our warehouse facilities, we would be in default under one or more of these facilities and our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facilities to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against loans pledged under such facilities and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings. these facilities also contain cross-default provisions, such that if a default occurs under any of our debt agreements, generally the lenders under our other debt agreements could also declare a default. these restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other business activities, which could materially and adversely affect us. as of june30, 2010, we were in breach of a covenant in one of our warehouse facilities that required the delinquency rate of the fannie mae loans on which we have risk-sharing to not increase more than 0.5% from quarter-end to quarter-end. our delinquency rate increased 0.71% from march31, 2010 to june30, 2010. the delinquency rate is calculated based on the unpaid principal amount of fannie mae dus loans on which we have risk-sharing that are sixty or more days delinquent. the lenders under this warehouse line waived the breach, and all related cross-defaults were waived. the covenant was subsequently amended to increase the maximum delinquency rate increase to 1% from quarter-end to quarter-end. while we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants included in our warehouse facilities as of september30, 2010, there can be no assurance that we will not experience another default of this nature in the future.we are subject to the risk of failed loan deliveries, and even after a successful closing and delivery, may be required to repurchase the loan or to indemnify the investor if we breach a representation or warranty made by us in connection with the sale of the loan through a gse or hud program, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. we bear the risk that a borrower will choose not to close on a loan that has been pre-sold to an investor or that the investor will choose not to close on the loan, including because a catastrophic change in the condition of a property occurs after we fund the loan and prior to the investor purchase date. we also have the risk of serious errors in loan documentation which prevent timely delivery of the loan prior to the investor purchase date. a complete failure to deliver a loan could be a default under the warehouse line used to finance the loan. although we have experienced only one failed delivery in our history, we can provide no assurance that we will not experience additional failed deliveries in the future or that any losses will not be material or will be mitigated through property insurance or payment protections. we must make certain representations and warranties concerning each loan originated by us for gse or hud programs. the representations and warranties relate to our practices in the origination and servicing of the loans and the accuracy of the information being provided by us. for example, we are generally required to provide the following, among other, representations and warranties: we are authorized to do business and to sell or assign the loan; the loan conforms to the requirements of the gse or hud and certain laws and regulations; the underlying mortgage represents a valid lien on the property and there are no other liens on the property; the loan documents are valid and enforceable; taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, rents and similar other payments have been paid or escrowed; the property is insured, conforms to zoning laws and remains intact; and we do not know of any issues regarding the loan that are reasonably expected to cause the loan to be delinquent or unacceptable for investment or adversely affect its value. we are permitted to satisfy certain of these representations and warranties by furnishing a title insurance policy. in the event of a breach of any representation or warranty, investors could, among other things, increase the level of risk-sharing on the fannie mae dus loan or require us to repurchase the full amount of the loan and seek indemnification for losses from us. our obligation to repurchase the loan is independent of our risk-sharing obligations. the gse or hud could require us to repurchase the loan if representations and warranties are breached, even if the loan is not in default. because the accuracy of many such representations and warranties generally is based on our actions or on third-party reports, such as title reports and environmental reports, we may not receive similar representations and warranties from other parties that would serve as a claim against them. even if we receive representations and warranties from third parties and have a claim against them in the event of a breach, our ability to recover on any such claim may be limited. our ability to recover against a borrower that breaches its representations and warranties to us may be similarly limited. our ability to recover on a claim against any party would also be dependent, in part, upon the financial condition and liquidity of such party. although we believe that we have capable personnel at all levels, use qualified third parties and have established controls to ensure that all loans are originated pursuant to requirements established by the gses and hud, in addition to our own internal requirements, there can be no assurance that we, our employees or third parties will not make mistakes. although we have never been required to repurchase any loan, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to do so in the future. any significant repurchase or indemnification obligations imposed on us could have a material adverse effect on us.we expect to offer new loan products to meet evolving borrower demands, including loans that we originate for our balance sheet. balance sheet lending would increase our risk of loss, and because we are not as experienced with such loan products, we may not be successful or profitable in offering such products. currently, we do not originate loans for our balance sheet, and all loans are pre-sold or placed with an investor before we close on the loan with the borrower. in the future, we expect to offer new loan products to meet evolving borrower demands, including loans that we originate for our balance sheet. carrying loans for longer periods of time on our balance sheet would expose us to greater risks of loss than we currently face for loans that are pre-sold or placed with investors, including, without limitation, 100% exposure for defaults, impairment charges and interest rate movements. we may initiate new loan product and service offerings or acquire them through acquisitions of operating businesses. because we may not be as experienced with new loan products or services, we may require additional time and resources for offering and managing such products and services effectively or may be unsuccessful in offering such new products and services at a profit.our business is significantly affected by general business, economic and market conditions and cycles, particularly in the multifamily and commercial real estate industry, including changes in government fiscal and monetary policies, and, accordingly, we could be materially harmed in the event of a continued market downturn or changes in government policies. we are sensitive to general business, economic and market conditions and cycles, particularly in the multifamily and commercial real estate industry. these conditions include changes in short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation and deflation, fluctuations in the real estate and debt capital markets and developments in national and local economies, unemployment rates, commercial property vacancy and rental rates. any sustained period of weakness or weakening business or economic conditions in the markets in which we do business or in related markets could result in a decrease in the demand for our loans and services, which could materially harm us. in addition, the number of borrowers who become delinquent, become subject to bankruptcy laws or default on their loans could increase, resulting in a decrease in the value of our msrs and servicer advances and higher levels of loss on our fannie mae loans for which we share risk of loss, and could materially and adversely affect us. we also are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the u.s. government and its agencies. we are particularly affected by the policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve"), which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states. the federal reserve's policies affect interest rates, which have a significant impact on the demand for commercial real estate loans. significant fluctuations in interest rates as well as protracted periods of increases or decreases in interest rates could adversely affect the operation and income of multifamily and other commercial real estate properties, as well as the demand from investors for commercial real estate debt in the secondary market. in particular, higher interest rates tend to decrease the number of loans originated. an increase in interest rates could cause refinancing of existing loans to become less attractive and qualifying for a loan to become more difficult. changes in fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could materially and adversely affect us.we are dependent upon the success of the multifamily real estate sector and conditions that negatively impact the multifamily sector may reduce demand for our products and services and materially and adversely affect us. we provide commercial real estate financial products and services primarily to developers and owners of multifamily properties. accordingly, the success of our business is closely tied to the overall success of the multifamily real estate market. various changes in real estate conditions may impact the multifamily sector. any negative trends in such real estate conditions may reduce demand for our products and services and, as a result, adversely affect our results of operations. these conditions include: oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, multifamily housing; a favorable interest rate environment that may result in a significant number of potential residents of multifamily properties deciding to purchase homes instead of renting; rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating multifamily housing, which could affect the profitability of multifamily developments; the inability of residents and tenants to pay rent; increased competition in the multifamily sector based on considerations such as the attractiveness, location, rental rates, amenities and safety record of various properties; and increased operating costs, including increased real property taxes, maintenance, insurance and utilities costs. moreover, other factors may adversely affect the multifamily sector, including changes in government regulations and other laws, rules and regulations governing real estate, zoning or taxes, changes in interest rate levels, the potential liability under environmental and other laws and other unforeseen events. any or all of these factors could negatively impact the multifamily sector and, as a result, reduce the demand for our products and services. any such reduction could materially and adversely affect us.for most loans that we service under the fannie mae and hud programs, we are required to advance payments due to investors if the borrower is delinquent in making such payments, which requirement could adversely impact our liquidity and harm our results of operations. for most loans we service under the fannie mae dus program, we are currently required to advance the principal and interest payments and tax and insurance escrow amounts up to 5% of the unpaid principal balance if the borrower is delinquent in making loan payments. once the 5% threshold is met, we can apply to fannie mae to have the advance rate reduced to 25% of any additional principal and interest payments and tax and insurance escrow amounts, which fannie mae may approve at its discretion. we are reimbursed by fannie mae for these advances. under the hud program, we are obligated to continue to advance principal and interest payments and tax and insurance escrow amounts on ginnie mae securities until the hud mortgage insurance claim and the ginnie mae security have been fully paid. in the event of a default on a hud insured loan, hud will reimburse approximately 99% of any losses of principal and interest on the loan and ginnie mae will reimburse the remaining losses of principal and interest. ginnie mae is currently considering a change to its programs that would eliminate the ginnie mae obligation to reimburse us for any losses not paid by hud in return for our receivi</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS An investment in the shares of Common Stock offered hereby involves a high degree of risk and immediate and substantial dilution and should only be made by persons who can afford a loss of their entire investment. In evaluating an investment in the Common Stock being offered hereby, investors should consider carefully, among other matters, the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this Prospectus. Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section, as well as in the sections entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Business." HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES; UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE PROFITABILITY The Company has a limited history of operations, and has accumulated net losses from inception in June 1992 through June 30, 1996, of approximately $3.2 million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development in connection with the ADAHF Patented Technology and/or the Enamelon Proprietary Technology (together, the "Enamelon Technologies") and from general and administrative costs. To date, the Company has neither commenced any product commercialization nor realized any operating revenues. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses at least through 1998, principally as a result of expenses of ongoing clinical testing and anticipated marketing and manufacturing expenses associated with the introduction of Enamelon toothpaste There can be no assurance that the Company will ever generate revenues or achieve profitability. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." DEPENDENCE ON SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF INITIAL PRODUCT The Company is dependent to a large extent on the success of its proposed toothpaste, which is being tested at a number of sites as well as at the Company's laboratory. Results of in vitro and animal studies are not necessarily indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials. Adverse or inconclusive clinical trial results concerning any of the Company's product formulations could significantly delay the marketing of such products or result in the limitation of the Company's potential product claims. In such event, further studies may have to be conducted by the Company. There can be no assurance that safe and effective commercially viable products can ever be developed by the Company, or that if they are developed, they can be produced in a timely manner, can be manufactured economically on a large scale, can be free from governmental and competitive challenges, and can achieve and sustain market acceptance. See "Use of Proceeds" and "Business -- Products." UNCERTAINTY OF CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF ENAMELON PRODUCTS The Company will be dependent upon consumer acceptance of the Enamelon toothpaste as an alternative to current well known brand name toothpastesMarket acceptance will depend, in part, on the Company's ability to demonstrate to consumers the effectiveness of its products. There can be no assurance that clinical studies will support the Company's anticipated advertising claims, that the Company will be able to market its toothpaste successfully or that future products, if any, will be accepted in the marketplace. See "Business -- Marketing." UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS The Company has focused its product development efforts to date on toothpaste using the Enamelon Technologies. Accordingly, the Company will require significant additional efforts to develop other products utilizing the Enamelon Technologies. Any such future product development efforts are subject to certain risks and may not succeed. These risks include, but are not limited to, the possibility that (i) new products will be 6 7 found ineffective or unsafe, (ii) even if safe and effective, they will be difficult to develop into commercially viable products or to manufacture economically on a large scale, free of governmental or competitive challenges and (iii) any such products will fail to achieve and sustain market acceptanceTherefore, there is substantial risk that the Company's product development efforts will not be successful. See "Business -- Strategy" and "-- Products." COMPETITION Competition in toothpaste products, as well as in chewing gum, food and confectionery products, is intense. The Company's primary competitors include companies with substantially greater financial, technological, marketing, personnel and research and development resources than those of the CompanyThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully in these markets. The Company's toothpaste products will compete with other brand name toothpastes including Crest, Colgate, Aquafresh, Mentadent, Arm & Hammer Dental Care and Sensodyne. Further, new products or future developments by others may provide therapeutic or cost advantages over the Company's proposed products. There can be no assurance that developments by others of similar or more effective products will not render the Company's products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete or that competitors will not challenge the validity of the Company's patent rights. Since the Company's proposed products will be new to the market and sold in competition with the products of companies with greater financial and other resources, there can be no assurance that a market for the Company's proposed products will develop. The Company's non-exclusive license to market products not covered by its exclusive licenses (including oral sprays, mouth rinses, and professional gels) outside of the United States is co-extensive with a license granted to SmithKline, which has financial and other resources that are substantially greater than those of the Company. Therefore, it is likely that the Company will not be able to compete with SmithKline for the sale of those products outside of the United States unless the Company enters into strategic alliances with other companies having financial and other resources comparable to those of SmithKline. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully market products covered by its non-exclusive license, even if it is able to form such alliances. See "Risk Factors -- Uncertain Ability to Protect Patents," "Business -- Competition" and "-- ADAHF Patents and Licenses." COMPLIANCE WITH THE MONOGRAPH The Company's products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"). The FDA has published a final monograph, Anticaries Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (the "Monograph"), for over-the-counter anticaries drug products, the category of non-prescription drug products that includes the Company's proposed oral care products. The Monograph establishes conditions under which over-the-counter drug products that aid in the prevention of tooth decay generally are recognized as being safe and effective and not misbranded. The Company's products may be lawfully marketed without being required to file a New Drug Application (an "NDA") with the FDA if they use as their sole active ingredient one of the active ingredients permitted in the Monograph and only make labeling claims permitted in the Monograph. The Company's proposed products are being developed with the sole active ingredient being sodium fluoride, an active ingredient permitted under the Monograph, and the Company intends to comply with the Monograph in all other respects. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will determine that the Company's proposed products meet all of the conditions of the Monograph. The Company will be limited in the claims it can make with respect to its products in order to remain in compliance with the Monograph. The Company's inability to market its proposed toothpaste products under the Monograph would have a material adverse effect on the Company. See "Business -- Government Regulation." In order to market its proposed products other than in compliance with the Monograph, the Company would be required to file an NDA. An NDA would require substantial testing procedures which are costly and time consuming. Accordingly, the Company's ability to sell its proposed products in the United States could be delayed for an indefinite period of time. Further, the Company may not have sufficient financial or other resources available to complete the NDA process and assuming such financial and other resources are 7 8 available, there is no assurance that the FDA would approve the Company's NDA, if one were necessary. See "Business -- Government Regulation." COMPLETION OF TOOTHPASTE DEVELOPMENT The Company is presently in the final phase of development of Enamelon toothpaste to comply with the Monograph, including finalizing the product's flavor and texture and confirming its stability. In order to market Enamelon toothpaste under the Monograph, the Company will be required to conduct an "animal caries" study and either a "fluoride uptake" study or an "enamel solubility reduction" study. The Company expects to complete development of Enamelon toothpaste and the studies required to market it under the Monograph by the end of 1996 so that it can begin initial test marketing in the early part of 1997. There can be no assurance, however, that completion of product development and required studies will occur when scheduled or that the results of the required studies will satisfy the requirements of the MonographSUBSTANTIATION OF ADDITIONAL ADVERTISING CLAIMS The Company intends to continue to conduct human clinical studies, which are intended to confirm efficacy in humans and begin to establish additional advertising claims. The Company believes that these advertising claims will distinguish Enamelon toothpaste from competitors and give the Company a competitive advantage. However, there can be no assurance that the results of the human clinical studies will substantiate the anticipated advertising claimsIn that event, the Company may be required to conduct additional human clinical studies, delay the national roll-out of Enamelon toothpaste, or change its marketing strategy COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATION In addition to regulation by the FDA under the Monograph, the Company is subject to additional FDA regulation as well as regulation under various other federal and state laws and agencies. Each domestic drug product manufacturing facility must be registered with the FDA, and each manufacturer must inform the FDA of every drug product it has in commercial distribution and keep such list updated. Domestic manufacturing facilities are also subject to at least biennial inspection by the FDA for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP") regulations promulgated by the FDA. Compliance with GMP regulations is required at all times during the manufacture and processing of drug productsAccordingly, to the extent that the Company utilizes contract manufacturers, such manufacturers must be in compliance with all FDA requirements. If such manufacturer is not in compliance with GMP, the FDA could bring an action to enforce its regulations which could lead to closing such manufacturing facility In that instance, the Company would be required to contract with another manufacturer on terms less favorable to the Company and the sales and marketing of its products could be disrupted. See "Business -- Manufacturing," "-- Government Regulation" and "Risk Factors -- Dependence on Others to Manufacture." Both the Company's products and its product claims may be challenged by the Company's competitors or by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or other governmental or private agencies. Such challenges may include an assertion that the data obtained by the Company to substantiate the Company's advertising claims may be inadequate or that such claims are inaccurate. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully defend any challenge in this area, or be able to modify its products or the claims with respect thereto to such an extent that the products remain commercially viable. If the Company is unable to defend such claims, it may become subject to an FTC cease and desist order, which could impair its ability to market its products. The laws and regulations administered by governmental agencies are subject to change and varying interpretations. While the Company intends to use its best efforts to comply with relevant laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that an agency might not assert a claim of noncompliance against the Company in the future. Unanticipated changes in laws or adverse interpretations of regulations could materially jeopardize the Company's ability to distribute its products or engage in its contemplated business activities. 8 9 The marketing of the Company's proposed products abroad will be subject to significant regulation by foreign cosmetic and/or drug regulatory agencies. No assurance can be given that the Company will be granted approval to market its proposed products in foreign countries, and the failure to obtain such required approvals would have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to market its products internationally. See "Business -- Government Regulation." DEPENDENCE ON LICENSING AGREEMENTS Since the Company considers the ADAHF Patented Technology to be a key element in its product development, the Company's license agreements with the ADAHF are material to the Company's business. If sales of the Company's products do not generate royalties of at least $17,000 during the last year of any exclusivity period under the Company's exclusive licenses, then the Company will not be entitled to renew the period of exclusivity and the ADAHF will be entitled to license the ADAHF Patented Technology to the Company's competitorsFurthermore, if the Company fails to pay the minimum royalties required under the license agreements or otherwise breaches such agreements, then the ADAHF will be entitled to terminate the agreements. In that event, the Company would be unable to use the ADAHF Patented Technology, which would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to develop, manufacture and sell its products, or even to continue in business. See "Business -- ADAHF Patents and Licenses." UNCERTAIN ABILITY TO PROTECT PATENTS The Company's ability to compete effectively depends on its success in protecting its proprietary technology, both in the United States and abroad. No assurance can be given that the Company's patent protection within and/or outside of the United States is sufficient to deter others, legally or otherwise, from developing or marketing competitive products utilizing the Enamelon Technologies. The United States patents and the pending foreign patent applications covering the ADAHF Patented Technology (the "ADAHF Patent Rights") and the Company's pending patent applications (the "Enamelon Patent Rights") (collectively with the ADAHF Patent Rights, the "Patent Rights") are material to the Company's business. No assurance can be given that any further patents will be issued from the United States or foreign patent offices for the Patent Rights or that the Company will receive any patents in the future based on its continued development efforts. The Company believes that the protection afforded by the Patent Rights is material to its future revenues and earnings. There can be no assurance that any of the Patent Rights will be found to be valid or that any of the Patent Rights will be enforceable or prevent others from developing and marketing competitive products or methods. A successful challenge to the validity of the Patent Rights would have a material adverse effect on the Company, and could jeopardize its ability to engage in its contemplated business. An infringement action on behalf of the Company may require the diversion of substantial funds from the Company's operations and may require management to expend efforts that might otherwise be devoted to the Company's operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in enforcing the Patent Rights. See "Risk Factors -- Competition." There can be no assurance that patent infringement claims in the United States or in other countries will not be asserted against the Company by a competitor or others, and if asserted, that the Company will be successful in defending against such claims. In the event one of the Company's proposed products is adjudged to infringe patents of others with the likely consequence of a damage award, the Company or any sublicensee may be enjoined from using and selling such product or be required to obtain a royalty-bearing license, if available on acceptable terms. Alternatively, in the event a license is not offered, the Company might be required to redesign those aspects of the product held to infringe so as to avoid infringement. In such case, any redesign efforts undertaken by the Company could require significant expense, necessitate an FDA review, delay the introduction or the re-introduction of the Company's products into certain markets, or be so significant as to be impractical. See "Business -- ADAHF Patents and Licenses." 9 10 PROTECTION OF PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION The Company also intends to rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to establish and maintain a competitive position in the market for its products. Although the Company has entered into confidentiality and invention agreements with its employees and consultants, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be honored or that the Company will be able to effectively protect its rights to its unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the Company's trade secrets and know-howEVOLVING PRODUCT FORMULATIONS The Company expects that its toothpaste and other product formulations will be modified from time to time as a result of the Company's ongoing research and product testing programs. As a result of such modifications, products that the Company produces in the future may differ from those that were the subject of earlier research and testing. Therefore, the research studies conducted to date and relied upon by the Company for efficacy and claims substantiation, as well as the Patent Rights obtained at this time, might not necessarily be applicable to the Company's future product formulations. In that event, the Company may be required to make significant additional expenditures on development and testing of these new formulations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that future product formulations will comply with the Monograph, that the Company will not be required to file an NDA, or that any products using such formulations will be commercially viable. See "Business -- Research and Development" and "-- ADAHF Patents and Licenses." LIMITED MARKETING CAPABILITY The Company has limited marketing capabilities and resources. Achieving market penetration will require significant efforts by the Company to create awareness of, and demand for, its proposed products. Accordingly, the Company's ability to build its customer base will be dependent on its marketing efforts, including its ability to establish an effective internal sales organization or establish strategic marketing arrangements with other companies. The failure by the Company to develop successfully its marketing capabilities, both internally and through wholesalers and brokers, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. Further, there can be no assurance that the development of such marketing capabilities will lead to sales of the Company's proposed products. The Company will be limited in the claims it can make with respect to its products in order to remain in compliance with the Monograph. See "Use of Proceeds," "Business -- Marketing" and "Risk Factors -- Compliance with the Monograph." DEPENDENCE ON OTHERS TO MANUFACTURE The Company currently has limited manufacturing capability. The Company does not intend to manufacture its toothpaste products for the United States market at the outset, but will instead utilize contract manufacturers. The Company currently does not have a written contract with a production manufacturer, although it is negotiating with an FDA-approved manufacturer and intends to enter into a written agreement with such manufacturer prior to commencement of pilot manufacturing. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that if the initial manufacturer becomes unavailable, the Company will be able to retain another qualified manufacturer on terms favorable to the Company. For the balance of the worldwide toothpaste markets, as well as for the Company's other proposed products, the Company may seek to sublicense or enter into joint ventures or strategic partnerships with major consumer product companies or other entities on either an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. Manufacturing arrangements in these markets are likely to be encompassed in any agreements establishing such relationships and may place primary manufacturing responsibility on others. The Company has no plan, agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to such relationships, and no assurance can be given that any will be entered into. The Company's dependence upon others for the manufacture of its products may adversely affect its future profit margins, if any, and may affect the Company's ability to sell its proposed products on a timely and 10 11 competitive basis. See "Risk Factors -- Compliance with Other Government Regulation" and "Business -- Manufacturing." FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS; UNCERTAINTY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING The Company's cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on numerous factors, including the status of the Company's marketing efforts, the Company's business development activities, the results of clinical trials, the regulatory process and competition. The Company currently estimates that the net proceeds of this offering, together with its projected cash flow from operations, if any, will be sufficient to finance its working capital and other requirements for a period of approximately 18 months from the date of this Prospectus. Thereafter, or sooner if conditions make it necessary, the Company may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings, including equity financings which may be dilutive to stockholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds if its capital resources are exhausted, or that funds will be available on terms attractive to the Company or at all. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate the commercial introduction of Enamelon toothpaste and otherwise reduce materially its proposed operations. See "Use of Proceeds" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." PRODUCT LIABILITY The sale of any over-the-counter consumer product may result in claims of adverse reactions by users. Although the Company has no intention of marketing any product without reasonable belief in its safety and efficacy when used in accordance with its instructions, misuse of the Company's products may result in consumer injury. In addition, future developments, including possible adverse medical studies and associated negative publicity, could have a material adverse impact on the market for the Company's products and on its results of operations. Further, the Company may be subject to certain consumer claims and informal complaints relating to its products which are incidental and routine to its business and for which the Company intends to maintain insurance coverage. Product liability insurance coverage is expensive and subject to many exclusions, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such insurance coverage in sufficient amounts or on favorable termsExclusions or damage limitations may render any insurance coverage obtained insufficient to protect the Company adequately from the successful assertion of a product liability claim. The Company currently maintains product liability insurance of $6.0 million per claim and $7.0 million in the aggregate on a "per occurrence" basis. There can be no assurance that the Company's present or future insurance coverage will be sufficient to satisfy product liability claims, if any, made against the Company with respect to injuries arising from the use of such products. In the event of a successful product liability claim against the Company, the insufficiency of insurance coverage and the negative publicity from such a suit could have a material adverse effect on the Company and jeopardize its ability to engage in its contemplated business activitiesThere also can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase such insurance coverage or to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms. If the Company's insurance coverage were to lapse or be terminated, then the Company would have no insurance coverage for claims arising subsequent to the lapse or termination of the policy. Product liability claims successfully asserted for claims arising after the lapse or termination of the policy could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. See "Business -- Liability Insurance." DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL The success of the Company will be largely dependent upon the personal efforts of Dr. Steven R. Fox, D. Brooks Cole, Norman Usen, and Anthony EWinston. The loss of the services of any of such persons could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and prospects. The Company has entered into a five-year employment agreement with Dr. Fox as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Notwithstanding, Dr. Fox currently continues to practice dentistry on a part-time basis. The Company has entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Cole as President and Chief Operating Officer pursuant to 11 12 which Mr. Cole serves at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. Although the Company has entered into employment agreements with each of the aforementioned individuals, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain their services. The success of the Company will also be dependent upon its ability to hire and retain additional qualified management, marketing and financial personnel. The Company will compete with other companies with greater financial and other resources for such personnel. See "Management -- Employment and Consulting Agreements." CONTROL BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS After this offering, the Company's directors, executive officers and principal stockholders will beneficially own approximately 54.1% of the Company's Common Stock (approximately 52.4% if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). Consequently, they will have the ability to elect all of the Company's directors and to control the outcome of all other issues submitted to the Company's stockholders and direction of the day-to-day affairs of the Company. See "Principal Stockholders." ABSENCE OF PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET; DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE Prior to this offering, there has been no public trading market for the Common Stock, and there can be no assurance that an active public market for the Common Stock will develop or continue following the offering. The initial public offering price of the Common Stock has been determined by negotiations between the Company and the Representatives (as defined herein) of the Underwriters and may not necessarily bear any relationship to the Company's assets, book value, revenues or other established criteria of value, and should not be considered indicative of the price at which the Common Stock will trade after completion of the offering. There can be no assurance that the market price of the Common Stock will not decline below the initial public offering price. See "Underwriting." POSSIBLE VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE Trading volume and prices for the Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operations, financial results, announcements with respect to sales and earnings, technological innovations, new product developments, the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of securities in the public market, and other events or factors which cannot be foreseen or predicted by the Company. In addition, various factors affecting consumer products companies, as well as price and volume volatility affecting small and emerging growth companies generally, but not necessarily related to their particular operating performance, may have a significant impact on the market price of the Common StockIMMEDIATE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION The Company's present stockholders acquired their shares of the Company's Common Stock at costs substantially below the offering price of the Common Stock to be sold in this offering. Therefore, investors purchasing Common Stock in this offering will incur an immediate and substantial dilution in net tangible book value per share of $5.11. See "Dilution." SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Future sales of shares of Common Stock by existing stockholders pursuant to Rule 144 ("Rule 144") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on the price of the shares of Common Stock. Upon completion of this offering, the Company will have 6,900,378 shares of Common Stock outstanding (7,155,378 shares if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). In addition, the Company has reserved for issuance (i) 1,233,806 shares upon exercise of options granted under the Plan, (ii) 266,194 shares upon exercise of options to be granted under the Plan and (iii) 980,652 shares upon exercise of outstanding warrants, including up to 170,000 shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants to be issued to the Representatives. 12 13 The 1,700,000 shares of Common Stock offered hereby (1,955,000 if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act except for any shares purchased by an "affiliate" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 144. The remaining 5,200,378 outstanding shares of Common Stock will be "restricted securities," as that term is defined in Rule 144, and may only be sold pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from registration thereunder, including exemptions provided by Rule 144. Approximately 3,785,000 of such shares will be eligible for resale under Rule 144 commencing no later than 90 days following the completion of this offering. The remaining shares will become eligible for resale under Rule 144 between May 1997 through January 1998. In addition, holders of 211,875 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase 152,814 shares of Common Stock at $1.33 per share have piggyback registration rights exercisable until June 30, 1997, and holders of Series A Preferred Stock convertible into 558,399 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase an additional 506,250 shares of Common Stock at $5.75 per share (the "Series A Preferred Stockholders") have three demand registration rights commencing six months from the date of this Prospectus exercisable for a period of five years after the date of this Prospectus, and unlimited piggyback registration rights exercisable until January 23, 2003 (subject to certain limitations). Such piggyback registration rights have been waived in connection with this offering. No prediction can be made as to the effect that future sales of Common Stock, or the availability of shares of Common Stock for future sales, will have on the market price of the Common Stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Common Stock and could impair the Company's ability to raise capital through the future sale</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. If the key markets within the semiconductor industry, especially semiconductor manufacturers, do not adopt our proprietary technologies and software products, we may be unable to generate sales of our productsThe four key markets within the semiconductor industry are semiconductor designers and design tool vendors, photomask manufacturers, semiconductor equipment manufacturers and semiconductor manufacturers. If these key markets do not adopt our proprietary technologies and software products, our product sales could decline. We design our technologies and products so that each key market within the semiconductor industry can work efficiently with the other markets. For example, if designers do not adopt our technologies and products, it will be more difficult for them to design semiconductors which are understood and processed efficiently by mask manufacturers that do adopt our technologies and products. In addition, we believe semiconductor manufacturers need to adopt our proprietary technologies and software products first in order to drive adoption by the other three markets. Semiconductor manufacturers define and develop the manufacturing process. While designers, mask manufacturers and equipment manufacturers are not required to adopt our technologies and products in order to work with semiconductor manufacturers that do adopt them, the efficiency of the entire manufacturing process is greatly diminished if they do not. If each key market of the semiconductor industry does not perceive our proprietary technologies and software products as the industry standard, our technologies and products could become less valuable and more difficult to license. Factors that may limit adoption of our subwavelength solution within the markets include: . our current and potential industry partners and customers may fail to adopt our technologies and products; . semiconductor designers may not need subwavelength processes if there is a slowdown in semiconductor manufacturing or a decrease in the demand for smaller semiconductor feature sizes; and . the industry may develop alternative methods to produce subwavelength features with existing capital equipment due to a rapidly evolving market and the likely emergence of new technologies. In order for potential industry partners and customers to adopt, and expend their own resources to implement, our technologies and products, we must expend significant marketing resources, with no guarantee of successOur proprietary technologies and software products involve a new approach to the subwavelength gap problem. As a result, we must employ intensive and sophisticated marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective industry partners and customers about the benefits of our technologies and products, with no guarantee of success. Our sales and marketing expenses increased from $1.4 million in 1998 to $4.3 million in 1999. In addition, even if our industry partners and customers adopt our proprietary technologies and software products, they must devote the resources necessary to fully integrate our technologies and products into their operations. This is especially true for our industry partners so that they can begin to resell and market our solution to their customers. If they do not make these expenditures, establishing our technologies and products as the industry standard to the subwavelength gap problem will be difficult. Our limited operating history and dependence on new technologies make it difficult to evaluate our future prospectsWe only have a limited operating history on which you can base your evaluation of our business. We face a number of risks as an emerging company in a new market. For example, the key markets within the 7 semiconductor industry may fail to adopt our proprietary technologies and software products, or we may not be able to establish distribution channels. Our company incorporated in October 1995. In February 1997, we shipped our initial software product, IC Workbench. We have only recently begun to expand our operations significantly. For example, we grew from 47 employees as of January 1, 1999 to 105 employees as of January 1, 2000. We have a history of losses, we expect to incur losses in the future and we may be unable to achieve profitabilityWe may not achieve profitability if our revenue increases more slowly than we expect or not at all. In addition, our operating expenses are largely fixed, and any shortfall in anticipated revenue in any given period could cause our operating results to decrease. We have not been profitable in any quarter, and our accumulated deficit was approximately $16.2 million as of December 31, 1999. We expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses in connection with increased funding for research and development and expansion of our sales and marketing efforts. In addition, we expect to incur additional noncash charges relating to amortization of intangibles and deferred stock compensation. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Any of the factors discussed above could cause our stock price to decline. We recently acquired Transcription Enterprises Limited and if we are not successful in integrating Transcription's products and operations with ours, our revenue and operating results could declineOur recent acquisition of Transcription Enterprises Limited will only be successful if we are able to integrate its operations with ours, which could substantially divert management's attention from the day-to-day operations of the combined company. If we encounter any difficulties in the transition process, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could decline. We must successfully integrate Transcription's products with ours. We must also coordinate our research and development and sales and marketing efforts to realize the technological benefits of this combinationWe may find it difficult to integrate personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combine two different corporate cultures. In addition, the process of combining our company with Transcription could interrupt the activities of either or both of the companies' businesses. It is possible that we will not be able to retain key Transcription management, technical and sales personnelIn addition, the acquisition of Transcription could cause our industry partners and customers to be uncertain about our ability to support the combined companies' products and the direction of the combined companies' product development efforts. As a result, they may delay or cancel product orders, which could significantly decrease our revenue and limit our ability to implement our combined business strategy. Our acquisition of Transcription may increase the focus of the semiconductor industry on the manufacturing data preparation market, which could lead to a rapid and substantial increase in competitionOur recent acquisition of Transcription may increase the semiconductor industry's awareness of the market for manufacturing data preparation software, which could lead to a substantial increase in the number of start-up companies that focus on software solutions for data preparation. Manufacturing data preparation software translates semiconductor designs into instructions that control manufacturing equipment. Potential competitors could pursue and execute partnership agreements with key industry partners we intend to pursue, which could make it difficult or impossible for us to develop relationships with these potential industry partners. In addition, some of our current competitors may increase their own research and development budgets relating to data preparation, or may more aggressively market competing solutions. 8 If we do not continue to introduce new technologies and software products or product enhancements ahead of rapid technological change in the market for subwavelength solutions, our operating results could decline and we could lose our competitive positionWe must continually devote significant engineering resources to enable us to introduce new technologies and software products or product enhancements to address the evolving needs of key markets within the semiconductor industry in solving the subwavelength gap problem. We must introduce these innovations and the key markets within the semiconductor industry must adopt them before changes in the semiconductor industry, such as the introduction by our current and potential competitors of more advanced products or the emergence of alternative technologies, render the innovations obsolete, which could cause us to lose our competitive position. These innovations are inherently complex, require long development cycles and a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability. Moreover, designers, mask manufacturers and equipment manufacturers must each respond to the demand of the market to design and manufacture masks and equipment for increasingly smaller and complex semiconductors. Our innovations must be viable and meet the needs of these key markets within the semicondutor industry before the consumer market demands even smaller semiconductors, rendering the innovations obsolete. We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund any future innovations. In addition, any revenue that we receive from enhancements or new generations of our proprietary technologies and software products may be less than the costs of development. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to declineIt is likely that our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate from time to time and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future period. As a result, the price of our common stock could decline. Historically, our quarterly operating results have fluctuated. We may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results. The following factors may cause these fluctuations: . the timing and structure of our product license agreements; . changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; and . changes in the level of our operating expenses to support our projected growth. We intend to pursue new, and maintain our current, industry partner relationships, which could substantially divert management attention and resources, with no guarantee of successWe expect to derive significant benefits, including increased revenue and customer awareness, from our current and potential industry partner relationships. In our pursuit to maintain and establish partner relationships within each of the key markets in the semiconductor industry, we could expend significant management attention, resources and sales personnel efforts, with no guarantee of success. To establish and maintain our partner relationships, we expend our limited financial resources on increasing our sales and business development personnel, trade shows and marketing within trade publications. If we did not have to pursue potential industry partners, we could focus these resources exclusively on direct sales to our customers. In addition, through our partner relationships, our partners resell, market, either jointly with us or unilaterally, and promote our technologies and products. If these relationships terminate, such as due to our material breach of the contracts or the partners' election to cancel the contract, which generally is permissible with prior notice to us, we would have to increase our own limited marketing and sales resources for these activities. Further, we may be unable to enter into new industry partner relationships if any of the following occur: . current or potential industry partners develop their own solutions to the subwavelength gap problem; or . our current or potential competitors establish relationships with industry partners with which we seek to establish a relationship. 9 We have only recently entered into many of our current partner relationships. These relationships may not continue or they may not be successful. We also may be unable to find suitable additional industry partners. To date, we have entered into agreements with industry partners, including: . Cadence in the design market; . DuPont Photomask and Photronics in the mask manufacturing market; and . Applied Materials, KLA-Tencor and Zygo Corporation in the semiconductor equipment market. Many of our current competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and as a result, they may acquire a significant market share before we Our current competitors, or alliances among these competitors, may rapidly acquire significant market share. These competitors may have greater name recognition and more customers which they could use to gain market share to our detriment. We encounter direct competition from other direct providers of phase shifting, OPC and manufacturing data technologies. These competitors include such companies as Avant! and Mentor Graphics. We also compete with companies that have developed or have the ability to develop their own proprietary phase shifting and OPC solutions, such as IBM. These companies may wish to promote their internally developed products and may be reluctant to purchase products from us or other independent vendors. Our competitors may offer a wider range of products than we do and thus may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and customer requirements. These competitors may also be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to customers than we do and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Moreover, our competitors may establish relationships among themselves or with industry partners to enhance their services, including industry partners with which we may desire to establish a relationship. The market for software solutions that address the subwavelength gap problem is new and rapidly evolving. We expect competition to intensify in the future, which could slow our ability to grow or execute our strategyWe believe that the demand for solutions to the subwavelength gap problem may encourage many competitors to enter into our market. As the market for software solutions to the subwavelength gap problem proliferates, if our competitors are able to attract industry partners or customers on a more accelerated pace than we can and retain them more effectively, we would not be able to grow and execute our strategy as quickly. In addition, if customer preferences shift away from our technologies and software products as a result of the increase in competition, we must develop new proprietary technologies and software products to address these new customer demands. This could result in the diversion of management attention or our development of new technologies and products may be blocked by other companies' patents. We must offer better products, customer support, prices and response time, or a combination of these factors, than those of our potential competitors. We are growing rapidly and must effectively manage and support our growth in order for our business strategy to succeedWe have grown rapidly and will need to continue to grow in all areas of operation. If we are unable to successfully integrate and support our existing and new employees into our operations, we may be unable to implement our business strategy in the time frame we anticipate, or at all. Due to our rapid growth in headcount, we outgrew our principal office facilities earlier than we expected. As a result, we recently relocated to San Jose, California and may need to relocate to a larger facility in the future, which could be difficult in the very competitive Silicon Valley office leasing market. In addition, building and managing the support necessary for our growth places significant demands on our management as well as our limited revenue. These demands have, and may continue to, divert these resources away from the continued growth of our business and 10 implementation of our business strategy. Further, we must adequately train our new personnel, especially our technical support personnel, to adequately, and accurately, respond to and support our industry partners and customers. If we fail to do this, it could lead to dissatisfaction among our partners or customers, which could slow our growth. We must continually attract and retain engineering personnel or we will be unable to execute our business strategyWe have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our rapid growth and expansion. We must continually enhance and introduce new generations of our phase shifting and OPC technologies. As a result, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate qualified engineering personnel with the requisite educational background and industry experience. If we lose the services of a significant number of our engineers, it could disrupt our ability to implement our business strategy. Competition for qualified engineers is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley where we are located. Our chief executive officer and chief technology officer, as well as the co- founders of Transcription, are critical to our business and they may not remain with us in the futureOur future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of Y. C. (Buno) Pati, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Yao- Ting Wang, our Chief Technology Officer, Roger Sturgeon, one of our directors and a senior executive of Transcription and Kevin MacLean, Vice President and General Manager of Transcription. If we lose the services of any of these key executives, it could slow our product development processes and searching for their replacements could divert our other senior management's time and increase our operating expenses. In addition, our industry partners and customers could become concerned about our future operations, which could injure our reputation. We do not have long-term employment agreements with these executives and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on their lives. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technologies which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue or increase our costsOur success depends heavily upon proprietary technologies, specifically our patent portfolio. The rights granted under our patents and patent applications may not provide competitive advantages to us. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights and incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Litigation could also divert our resources, including our managerial and engineering resources. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights and prevent competitors from using our proprietary technologies in their products. These laws and procedures provide only limited protection. We have been issued two U.S. patents, have five U.S. patent applications currently pending in the U.S. and nine foreign patent applications currently pending in selected foreign countries. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Also, patent protection in foreign countries may be limited or unavailable where we have filed for and need such protection. Furthermore, if we fail to adequately protect our trademark rights, this could impair our brand identity and ability to compete effectively. If we do not successfully protect our trademark rights, this could force us to incur costs to re-establish our name or our product names, including significant marketing activities. If third parties assert that our proprietary technologies and software products infringe their intellectual property rights, this could injure our reputation and limit our ability to license or sell our proprietary technologies or software productsThird parties, for competitive or other reasons, could assert that our proprietary technologies and software products infringe their intellectual property rights. These claims could injure our reputation and decrease or 11 block our ability to license or sell our software products. For example, on March 14, 2000, ASML MaskTools, Inc. filed a complaint alleging we infringe two U.S. patents and have committed unfair or fraudulent business practice under the California Business and Professions Code. We are currently investigating the patents and allegations. The defense of these claims could divert management's attention from the day to day operations of our company, as well as divert resources from current planned uses, such as hiring and supporting additional engineering personnel. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and an adverse decision could limit our ability to offer some features in our OPC product. Third parties have advised us of literature which they believe to be relevant to our patents. We have not reviewed all of the information contained in this literature. It is possible that this literature or literature we may be advised of in the future could negatively affect the scope or enforceability of our present or future patents, and/or result in costly litigation. In addition, we are aware of and are evaluating certain patents with which our products, patents or patent applications may conflict. If any of these patents are found to be valid, and we are unable to license such patents on reasonable terms, or if our products, patents, or patent applications are found to conflict with these patents, we could be prevented from selling our products, our patents may be declared invalid or our patent applications may not result in issued patents. In addition, a company could invite us to take a patent license. If we do not take the license, the requesting company could contact our industry partners or customers and suggest that they not use our software products because we are not licensed under their patents. This action by the requesting company could affect our relationships with these industry partners and customers and may prevent future industry partners and customers from licensing our software products. The intensely competitive nature of our industry and the important nature of our technologies to our competitors' businesses may contribute to the likelihood of being subject to third party claims of this nature. Please see "Business--Intellectual Property." Any potential dispute involving our patents or other intellectual property could include our industry partners and customers, which could trigger our indemnification obligations with them and result in substantial expense to usIn any potential dispute involving our patents or other intellectual property, our licensees could also become the target of litigation. This could trigger our technical support and indemnification obligations in some of our license agreements which could result in substantial expense to us. In addition to the time and expense required for us to supply such support or indemnification to our licensees, any such litigation could severely disrupt or shut down the business of our licensees, which in turn could hurt our relations with our customers and cause the sale of our proprietary technologies and software products to decrease. Defects in our proprietary technologies and software products could decrease our revenue and our competitive market shareIf our industry partners and customers discover any defects after they implement our proprietary technologies and software products, these defects could significantly decrease the market acceptance and sales of our software products, which could decrease our competitive market share. Any actual or perceived defects with our proprietary technologies and software products may also hinder our ability to attract or retain industry partners or customers, leading to a decrease in our revenue. These defects are frequently found during the period following introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products. Despite testing prior to introduction, our software products may contain software errors not discovered until after customer implementation. If our software products contain errors or defects, it could require us to expend significant resources to alleviate these problems, which could result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts. We face operational and financial risks associated with international operationsWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales. We have only limited experience in developing, marketing, selling and supporting our proprietary technologies and software products 12 internationally and may not succeed in maintaining or expanding our international operations, which could slow our revenue growth. We are subject to risks inherent in doing business in international markets. These risks include: . fluctuations in exchange rates which may negatively affect our operating results; . greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable resulting in longer collection periods; . compliance with and unexpected changes in a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar; . export controls which could prevent us from shipping our software products into and from some markets; . changes in import/export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our software products and reduce our market share in some countries; and . economic or political instabilityWe may be unable to continue to market our proprietary technologies and software products successfully in international markets. We may need to raise additional funds to support our growth or execute our strategy and if we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or enhance our proprietary technologies and software products, respond to competitive pressures or acquire desired businesses or technologiesWe currently anticipate that our available cash resources, combined with the net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional funds in order to: . support more rapid expansion; . develop new or enhanced products; . respond to competitive pressures; or . acquire complementary businesses or technologiesThese factors will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds. We may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements. We may be unable to consummate other potential acquisitions or investments or successfully integrate them with our business, which may slow our ability to expand the range of our proprietary technologies and software productsTo expand the range of our proprietary technologies and software products, we may acquire or make investments in additional complementary businesses, technologies or products if appropriate opportunities arise. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms, or consummate future acquisitions or investments, each of which could slow our growth strategy. If we do acquire additional companies or make other types of acquisitions, we may have difficulty integrating the acquired products, personnel or technologies. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. Management will have broad discretion as to the use of proceeds from this offering and, as a result, we may not use the proceeds to the satisfaction of our stockholdersOur board of directors and management will have broad discretion in allocating the net proceeds of this offering. They may choose to allocate such proceeds in ways that do not yield a favorable return or are not 13 supported by our stockholders. We have designated only limited specific uses for the net proceeds from this offering. Please see "Use of Proceeds." The concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders upon the completion of this offering will likely limit your ability to influence corporate mattersThe concentration of ownership of our outstanding capital stock with our directors and executive officers after this offering may limit your ability to influence corporate matters. Prior to the completion of this offering, our directors and executive officers, and their affiliates, beneficially own 67.0% of our outstanding capital stock, and we expect them to remain significant stockholders upon the completion of this offering. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will have the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and the approval of any corporate transactions. We have anti-takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our companyProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect after completion of this offering and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Please see "Description of Capital Stock." Negotiations between the underwriters and us determined the initial public offering price, but the market price may be less or may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering priceThis initial public offering price may vary from the market price of our common stock after the offering. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: . actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; . changes in market valuations of other technology companies; . conditions or trends in the semiconductor industry; . announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions or partnerships; . additions or departures of key personnel; . any deviations in net revenue or in losses from levels expected by securities analysts; . volume fluctuations, which are particularly common among highly volatile securities of technology related companies; and . sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or other securities in the open marketGeneral political or economic conditions, such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations in the United States or abroad, also could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Please see "Underwriting." Our stock price is likely to be extremely volatile as the market for technology companies' stock has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuationsVolatility in the market price of our common stock could result in securities class action litigation. Any litigation would likely result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. Despite the strong pattern of operating losses of technology companies, the market demand, valuation and trading prices of these companies have been high. At the same time, the share prices of these companies' stocks have been highly volatile and have recorded lows well below their historical highs. As a result, investors 14 in these companies often buy the stock at very high prices only to see the price drop substantially a short time later, resulting in an extreme drop in value in the stock holdings of these investors. Our stock may not trade at the same levels as other technology stocks. In addition, technology stocks in general may not sustain current market prices. An active public market for our common stock may not developAn active public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained after this offering.

      <td>risk factors an investment in our common stock involves risks. before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the other information included in this prospectus. the discussion below presents material risks associated with an investment in our common stock. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. in such a case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. the risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. see cautionary noteregarding forward-looking statements. risks related to our businessour decisions regarding credit risk could be inaccurate and our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of our secured loans. we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we consider adequate to absorb future losses which may occur in our loan portfolio. in determining the size of the allowance, we analyze our loan portfolio based on our historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, national and local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. as of march31, 2006, our allowance for loan losses was approximately $24.4million, or 1.96% of our total loans receivable. if our assumptions are incorrect, our current allowance may be insufficient to cover future loan losses, and increased loan loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. in addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of our management. any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs could have a negative effect on our operating results.because we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate, a downturn in the real estate market could result in losses and materially and adversely affect business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate. as of march31, 2006, approximately 82.2% of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. an adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate generally or in our primary markets specifically could significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. furthermore, it is likely that we would be required to increase our provision for loan losses. if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses, our profitability and financial condition could be adversely impacted.because we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers, a significant loss on any of those loans could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers. under applicable law, each of our bank subsidiaries is generally permitted to make loans to one borrowing relationship up to 20% of their respective capital in the case of our arkansas bank subsidiaries, and 15% of capital (25% on secured loans) in the case of our florida bank subsidiary. historically, when our bank subsidiaries have lending relationships that exceed their individual loan to one borrower limitation, the overline, or amount in excess of the subsidiarybanks legal lending limit, is participated to our other bank subsidiaries. as a result, on a consolidated basis we may have aggregate exposure to individual or related borrowers in excess of each individual bank subsidiarys legal lending limit. as of march31, 2006, the aggregate legal lending limit of our bank subsidiaries for secured loans was approximately $34.4million. currently, our board of directors has established an in-house consolidated lending limit of $16.0million to any one borrowing relationship without obtaining the approval of our chairman and our vice chairman. as of march31, 2006, we had 11 borrowing relationships where we had a commitment to loan in excess of $10.0million, with the aggregate amount of those commitments totaling approximately $180.0million. the largest of those commitments to one borrowing relationship was $27.3million, which is 16.1% of our consolidated shareholders equity. given the size of these loan relationships relative to our capital levels and earnings, a significant loss on any one of these loans could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.the unexpected loss of key officers may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. our success depends significantly on our executive officers, especially john w. allison, ron w. strother, randy e. mayor, and on the presidents of our bank subsidiaries. our bank subsidiaries, in particular, rely heavily on their management teams relationships in their local communities to generate business. because we do not have employment agreements or non-compete agreements with our employees, our executive officers and bank presidents are free to resign at any time and accept an employment offer from another company, including a competitor. the loss of services from a member of our current management team may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.our growth and expansion strategy may not be successful and our market value and profitability may suffer. growth through the acquisition of banks, de novo branching, and the organization of new banks represents an important component of our business strategy. although we have no present plans to acquire any financial institution or financial services provider, any future acquisitions we might make will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. these risks include, among other things: credit risk associated with the acquired banks loans and investments; difficulty of integrating operations and personnel;and potential disruption of our ongoing business. we expect that competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant. we may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources. we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions. in addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, we plan to continue de novo branching, and we may consider the organization of new banks in new market areas. we do not, however, have any current plans to organize a new bank. de novo branching and any acquisition or organization of a new bank carries with it numerous risks, including the following: the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals; significant costs and anticipated operating losses associated with establishing a de novo branch or a new bank; the inability to secure the services of qualified senior management; the local market may not accept the services of a new bank owned and managed by a bank holding company headquartered outside of the market area of the new bank; the inability to obtain attractive locations within a new market at a reasonable cost;and the additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls. we cannot assure that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions, de novo branching and the organization of new banks. our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value and profitability. we expect to continue to grow our assets and deposits, the products and services we offer, and the scale of our operations, generally, both internally and through acquisitions. if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to control costs and maintain our asset quality. our ability to manage our growth successfully will depend on our ability to maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms. if we grow too quickly and are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, this rapid growth could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.there may be undiscovered risks or losses associated with our acquisitions of bank subsidiaries which would have a negative impact upon our future income. our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions of bank subsidiaries. we acquired three bank subsidiaries in 2005, and will continue to consider strategic acquisitions, with a primary focus on arkansas and southwestern florida. in most cases, our acquisition of a bank includes the acquisition of all of the target banks assets and liabilities, including its loan portfolio. there may be instances when we, under our normal operating procedures, may find after the acquisition that there may be additional losses or undisclosed liabilities with respect to the assets and liabilities of the target bank, and, with respect to its loan portfolio, that the ability of a borrower to repay a loan may have become impaired, the quality of the value of the collateral securing a loan may fall below our standards, or the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate. one or more of these factors might cause us to have additional losses or liabilities, additional loan charge-offs, or increases in allowances for loan losses, which would have a negative impact upon our future income.an economic downturn, natural disaster or act of terrorism, especially one affecting our market areas, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. our business is affected by prevailing economic conditions in the united states, including inflation and unemployment rates, but is particularly subject to the local economies in arkansas, the florida keys and southwestern florida. our relatively small size and our geographic concentration expose us to greater risk of unfavorable local economic conditions than the larger national or regional banks in our market areas. adverse changes in local economic factors, such as population growth trends, income levels, deposits and housing starts, may adversely affect our operations. we are at risk of natural disaster or acts of terrorism, even if our market areas are not primarily affected. our florida market, in particular, is subject to risks from hurricanes, which may damage or dislocate our facilities, damage or destroy collateral, adversely affect the livelihood of borrowers or otherwise cause significant economic dislocation in areas we serve. if and when economic conditions deteriorate, either in our local market areas or nationwide, we may experience a reduction in the demand for our products and services and deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio and consequently have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect our profitability. the banking business is highly competitive. we experience strong competition, not only from commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions, but also from mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other financial institutions operating in or near our market areas. we compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans.many of our competitors are much larger national and regional financial institutions. we may face a competitive disadvantage against them as a result of our smaller size and resources and our lack of geographic diversification. we also compete against community banks that have strong local ties. these smaller institutions are likely to cater to the same small and mid-sized businesses that we target and to use a relationship-based approach similar to ours. in addition, our competitors may seek to gain market share by pricing below the current market rates for loans and paying higher rates for deposits. competitive pressures can adversely affect our profitability.our recent results do not indicate our future results, and may not provide guidance to assess the risk of an investment in our common stock. we are unlikely to sustain our historical rate of growth, and may not even be able to expand our business at all. further, our recent growth may distort some of our historical financial ratios and statistics. in the future, we may not have the benefit of several recently favorable factors, such as a strong residential housing market or the ability to find suitable expansion opportunities. various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence. if we are not able to successfully grow our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.we may not be able to raise the additional capital we need to grow and, as a result, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired. federal and state regulatory authorities require us and our bank subsidiaries to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. while we believe that our capital will be sufficient to support our current operations and anticipated expansion, factors such as faster than anticipated growth, reduced earning levels, operating losses, changes in economic conditions, revisions in regulatory requirements, or additional acquisition opportunities may lead us to seek additional capital. our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance and on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control. if we need additional capital but cannot raise it on terms acceptable to us, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired.we are considered by the federal reserve board to be a source of financial strength for white river bancshares and may be required to support its capital. we hold a 20% ownership interest in white river bancshares, inc., a bank holding company headquartered in fayetteville, arkansas. our minority ownership means that we lack effective power to control the operations of the holding company. we are, nevertheless, considered by the federal reserve board to be a source of financial strength for that holding company. as a result, we may be required to contribute sufficient funds for white river bancshares to meet regulatory capital requirements if it is unable to raise funds from other sources. an obligation to support white river bancshares may be required at times when, in the absence of this federal reserve board policy, we might not be inclined to provide it. as of and for the year ended december31, 2005, white river bancshares had total assets of $184.7million, total shareholders equity of $51.2million, and a net operating loss of $2.7million. the capital ratios for white river bancshares wholly-owned bank subsidiary, signature bank of arkansas, at year-end and the minimum ratios required to be considered well capitalized were: leverage ratio, 24.7% (5.0% required); tier1 capital ratio, 27.8% (6.0% required); and total risk-based capital ratio, 29.0% (10.0% required). we may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on our common stock. although we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock since the second quarter of 2003 and expect to continue this practice, we cannot assure you of our ability to continue. our ability to pay dividends depends on the following factors, among others: we may not have sufficient earnings since our primary source of income, the payment of dividends to us by our bank subsidiaries, is subject to federal and state laws that limit the ability of these banks to pay dividends. federal reserve board policy requires bank holding companies to pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs and financial condition. before dividends may be paid on our common stock in any year, dividends of $0.25per share must first be paid on our classa preferred stock and $0.57per share on our classb preferred stock. before dividends may be paid on our common stock in any year, payments must be made on our subordinated debentures. our board of directors may determine that, even though funds are available for dividend payments, retaining the funds for internal uses, such as expansion of our operations, is a better strategy. if we fail to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be your sole opportunity for gains on your investment.our directors and executive officers own a significant portion of our common stock and can exert significant control over our business and corporate affairs. our directors and executive officers, as a group, will beneficially own approximately 38.6% of our common stock immediately following this offering. consequently, if they vote their shares in concert, they can significantly influence the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors. the interests of our officers and directors may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock, and they may take actions affecting our company with which you disagree.the holders of our subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders. we have $44.8million of subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities. payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are unconditionally guaranteed by us. the subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock. as a result, we must make payments on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock. we have the right to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock. risks related to our industryour profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and monetary policy. most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, and thus subject us to significant risks from changes in interest rates. consequently, our results of operations can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and our ability to manage interest rate risk. changes in market interest rates, or changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates, or changes in the relationship between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. this difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income or a decrease in interest rate spread. in addition to affecting our profitability, changes in interest rates can impact the valuation of our assets and liabilities.as of march31, 2006, our one-year ratio of interest-rate-sensitive assets to interest-rate-sensitive liabilities was 104.1% and our cumulative gap position was 2.3% of total earning assets, resulting in a minimum impact on earnings for various interest rate change scenarios. floating rate loans made up 39.1% of our $1.2billion loan portfolio. in addition, 70.7% of our loans receivable and 81.3% of our time deposits were scheduled to reprice within 12months and our other rate sensitive asset and rate sensitive liabilities composition is subject to change. significant composition changes in our rate sensitive assets or liabilities could result in a more unbalanced position and interest rate changes would have more of an impact to our earnings. our results of operations are also affected by the monetary policies of the federal reserve board. actions by the federal reserve board involving monetary policies could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand or business and earnings.we are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business, which limitations or restrictions could adversely affect our profitability. we are a registered financial holding company primarily regulated by the federal reserve board. our bank subsidiaries are also primarily regulated by the federal reserve board, the federal deposit insurance corporation, and the arkansas state bank department or florida office of financial regulation. complying with banking industry regulations is costly and may limit our growth and restrict certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. we are also subject to capital requirements by our regulators. violations of various laws, even if unintentional, may result in significant fines or other penalties, including restrictions on branching or bank acquisitions. recently, banks generally have faced increased regulatory sanctions and scrutiny, particularly under the usa patriot act and statutes that promote customer privacy or seek to prevent money laundering. as regulation of the banking industry continues to evolve, we expect the costs of compliance to continue to increase and, thus, to affect our ability to operate profitably. upon completion of this offering, we will become subject to the many requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq. these laws and regulations will increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. although we are accustomed to conducting business in a highly regulated environment, these laws and regulations have different requirements for compliance than we have previously experienced. our expenses for accounting, legal and consulting services will increase because of the new obligations we will face as a public company. in addition, the sudden application of these requirements to our business will result in some cultural adjustments and may strain our management resources. to date, we have not conducted a comprehensive review and confirmation of the adequacy of our existing systems and controls as will be required under section404 of the sarbanes-oxley act, and will not do so until after the completion of this offering. we may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. if that is the case, we intend to take the necessary steps to correct any deficiencies. these steps may be costly and strain our resources. a decline in the market price for our common stock may result if we are unable to comply with the sarbanes-oxley act. risks related to this offeringwe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering, and our use of those proceeds may not yield a favorable return on your investment. we will use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, our working capital needs and providing investments in our bank subsidiaries. we may also use the net proceeds to finance bank acquisitions, though we have no present plans in that regard. thus, ourmanagement has broad discretion over how these proceeds are used and could spend the proceeds in ways with which you may not agree. we may not invest the proceeds of this offering effectively or in a manner that yields a favorable (or any) return on our common stock, and consequently, this could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business or cause the price of our common stock to decline.there has been no prior active trading market for our common stock. we cannot assure you that an active public trading market will develop after the offering and, even if it does, our stock price may trade below the public offering price. there has been no public market for our common stock prior to this offering. an active trading market for our common stock may never develop or be sustained, which could affect your ability to sell your shares. even if a market develops for our common stock after the offering, the market price of our common stock may experience significant volatility. factors that may affect the price of our common stock include the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, investor perception of our financial strength, conditions in the banking industry such as credit quality and monetary policies, and general economic and market conditions. our quarterly operating results, changes in analysts earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or financial markets or other developments affecting us could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. in addition, the initial public offering price has been determined through negotiations between us and the underwriters, and may bear no relationship to the price at which the common stock will trade upon completion of the offering.investors in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution. purchasers in this offering will experience immediate dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price and the net tangible book value per share of our common stock. this dilution is estimated to be $8.36 per share, based on the initial offering price of $18.00 per share and our pro forma net tangible book value of $9.64per share as of march31, 2006. this per-share dilution takes into account the conversion to common stock of our outstanding shares of classa preferred stock and classb preferred stock, as it is our intent to effect those conversions as soon as practicable after the offering is completed. to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities in the future, our shareholders may experience additional dilution. our board of directors may determine, from time to time, a need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other securities. we may issue additional securities at prices or on terms less favorable than or equal to the public offering price and terms of this offering.the ability of our insiders or the holders of our classa and classb preferred stock to sell substantial amounts of common stock after this offering may depress the market price of our common stock or cause it to decline. there are three potentially significant sources of shares of our common stock that may come on the market after this offering: our directors and executive officers will beneficially own approximately 38.6% of our common stock immediately after this offering. although they are subject to lock-up agreements with our underwriters, which generally prevent them from selling their shares within 180days after the offering, the underwriters may release them from those obligations. in any event, after the lock-up agreements expire, approximately 6.7million additional shares of our common stock could become tradable by our directors and executive officers. we intend to require that all of the outstanding shares of our classa preferred stock be converted to common stock as soon as practicable after june6, 2006, the first date on which we can require conversion of those shares. we also intend, as soon as practicable after this offering, to require that our classb preferred stock be converted to common stock. conversion of our classa preferred stock and classb preferred stock will result in approximately 2,159,921shares of our common stock being issued. approximately 80,720additional shares of our common stock may be issued upon exercise of outstanding preferred stock options and the subsequent conversion to common stock of the preferred shares issued. most of the holders of the newly issued shares of common stock will be eligible immediately to sell their shares. we intend to register all common stock that we may issue upon exercise of outstanding options under our 2006 stock option and performance incentive plan. once we register these shares, they can be sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws and, if applicable, the lock-up agreements described above. as of march31, 2006, stock options to purchase968,244shares of our common stock had been granted under this plan, of which 481,224 are presently exercisable. sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock after this offering, or the expectation that these sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.</td>

      <td>risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in such case, you may lose all or part of your original investment. risks relating to our businessmany of the products we manufacture or purchase and resell are commodities whose price is determined by the market's supply and demand for such products, and the markets in which we operate are cyclical and competitive. the depressed state of the housing, construction and home improvement markets could continue to adversely affect demand and pricing for our products. many of the building products we produce or distribute, including osb, plywood, lumber and particleboard, are commodities that are widely available from other manufacturers or distributors with prices and volumes determined frequently in an auction market, based on participants' perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors. at times, the price for any one or more of the products we produce may fall below our cash production costs, requiring us to either incur short-term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities. therefore, our profitability with respect to these commodity products depends, in significant part, on managing our cost structure, particularly raw materials and labor, which represent the largest components of our operating costs. commodity wood product prices could be volatile in response to operating rates and inventory levels in various distribution channels. commodity price volatility affects our distribution business, with falling price environments generally causing reduced revenues and margins, resulting in substantial declines in profitability and possible net losses. historically, demand for the products we manufacture, as well as the products we purchase and distribute, has been closely correlated with new residential construction in the united states and, to a lesser extent, light commercial construction and residential repair and remodeling activity. new residential construction activity remained substantially below average historical levels during 2012 and so did demand for many of the products we manufacture and distribute. there is significant uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of any recovery in such construction activity and resulting product demand levels. demand for new residential construction is influenced by seasonal weather factors, mortgage availability and rates, unemployment levels, household formation rates, domestic population growth, immigration rates, residential vacancy and foreclosure rates, demand for second homes, existing home prices, consumer confidence and other general economic factors. wood products industry supply is influenced primarily by price-induced changes in the operating rates of existing facilities but is also influenced over time by the introduction of new product technologies, capacity additions and closures, restart of idled capacity and log availability. the balance of wood products supply and demand in the united states is also heavily influenced by imported products, principally from canada. we have very limited control of the foregoing, and as a result, our profitability and cash flow may fluctuate materially in response to changes in the supply and demand balance for our primary products.our industry is highly competitive. if we are unable to compete effectively, our sales, operating results and growth strategies could be negatively affected. the markets for the products we manufacture in our wood products segment are highly competitive. our competitors range from very large, fully integrated forest and building products firms to smaller firms that may manufacture only one or a few types of products. we also compete less directly with firms that manufacture substitutes for wood building products. certain mills operated by our competitors may be lower-cost manufacturers than the mills operated by us. the building products distribution industry that our building materials distribution segment competes in is highly fragmented and competitive, and the barriers to entry for local competitors are relatively low. competitive factors in our industry include pricing and availability of product, service and delivery capabilities, ability to assist customers with problem solving, customer relationships, geographic coverage and breadth of product offerings. also, financial stability is important to suppliers and customers in choosing distributors and allows for more favorable terms on which to obtain products from suppliers and sell products to customers. if our financial condition deteriorates in the future, our support from suppliers may be negatively affected. some of our competitors are larger companies and, therefore, have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. these resources may afford those competitors greater purchasing power, increased financial flexibility and more capital resources for expansion and improvement, which may enable those competitors to compete more effectively than we can.our manufacturing businesses may have difficulty obtaining wood fiber at favorable prices or at all. wood fiber is our principal raw material, which accounted for approximately 43% of the aggregate amount of materials, labor and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation), for our wood products segment in 2012. wood fiber is a commodity and prices have been cyclical historically in response to changes in domestic and foreign demand and supply. foreign demand for timber exports, particularly from china, increased timber costs in the western u.s. in 2010 and 2011 and negatively affected wood products manufacturers in the region. in 2012, china's demand for timber exports from the western u.s. declined from 2011 levels, but in the future we expect that the level of foreign demand for timber exports from the western u.s. will continue to fluctuate based on the economic activity in china and other pacific rim countries, currency exchange rates and the availability of timber supplies from other countries such as canada, russia and new zealand. sustained periods of high timber costs may impair the cost competitiveness of our manufacturing facilities. we currently enjoy the benefit of supply agreements put in place in 2005 following the sale of our timberlands (or successor arrangements), under which we purchase timber at market based prices. for 2012, approximately 33% of our timber was supplied pursuant to agreements assumed by (or replacement master supply agreements with) hancock natural resource group,inc. ("hancock"), the molpus woodlands groupllc ("molpus") and rayonier louisiana timberlands,llc, a timberland real estate investment trust ("rayonier"). the supply agreements with these parties terminate on december31, 2014, subject to additional one-year extensions unless notice is provided to the other party at least six months prior to expiration of the applicable agreement. if a counterparty to these agreements elects not to continue these agreements or we are unable to renegotiate these agreements on terms that are acceptable to us, we would need to locate a replacement supplier for our timber requirements, which could include private purchases with other suppliers, open-market purchases and purchases from governmental sources. if we are unable to locate a replacement supplier in a particular region to satisfy our timber needs at satisfactory prices, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. in 2012, we purchased approximately 21% of our timber from federal, state and local governments. in certain regions in which we operate, a substantial portion of our timber is purchased from governmental authorities. as a result, existing and future governmental regulation can affect our access to, and the cost of, such timber. future domestic or foreign legislation and litigation concerning the use of timberlands, timber harvest methodologies, forest road construction and maintenance, the protection of endangered species, forest-based carbon sequestration, the promotion of forest health and the response to and prevention of catastrophic wildfires can affect timber and fiber supply from both government and private lands. availability of harvested timber and fiber may be further limited by fire, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, windstorms, hurricanes, flooding and other natural and man-made causes, thereby reducing supply and increasing prices. availability of residual wood fiber for our particleboard operation has been negatively affected by significant mill closures and curtailments that have occurred among solid-wood product manufacturers. future development of wood cellulose biofuel or other new sources of wood fiber demand could interfere with our ability to source wood fiber or lead to significantly higher costs.significant changes in discount rates, actual investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect our earnings, equity and pension contributions in future periods. our earnings may be negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension plans. gaap requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. these valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. the most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension expense are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. in addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to "accumulated other comprehensive loss." a decline in the market value of the pension assets will increase our funding requirements. our pension plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension plans. at december31, 2012, the net underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans was $192.5million. if the status of our defined benefit plans continues to be underfunded, we anticipate significant future funding obligations, reducing the cash available for our business. for more discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan estimates, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimatespensions."our recent significant capital investments have increased fixed costs, which could negatively affect our profitability. in the past three years, we have completed a number of capital investments, including significantly increasing our outdoor storage acreage and leasing additional warehouse space. in the future, we expect to make further capital investments, primarily related to internal veneer production. these significant capital investments have resulted in increased fixed costs, which could negatively affect our profitability if the housing market does not recover and revenues do not improve to offset our incremental fixed costs.a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, including the demand from our building materials distribution business, reduce our sales, and/or negatively affect our financial results. any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including but not limited to: equipment failure, particularly a press at one of our major ewp production facilities; fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes; unscheduled maintenance outages; utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions; labor difficulties; other operational problems; or ecoterrorism or threats of ecoterrorism. any downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. if our machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to satisfy customer requirements would be impaired, resulting in lower sales and net income. because approximately 39% of our wood products sales in the ltm period, including approximately 73% of our ewp sales, were to our building materials distribution business, a material disruption at our wood products facilities would also negatively impact our building materials distribution business. we are therefore exposed to a larger extent to the risk of disruption to our wood products manufacturing facilities due to our vertical integration and the resulting impact on our building materials distribution business. in addition, a number of our suppliers are subject to the manufacturing facility disruption risks noted above. our suppliers' inability to produce the necessary raw materials for our manufacturing processes or supply the finished goods that we distribute through our building materials distribution segment may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.adverse conditions may increase the credit risk from our customers. our building materials distribution and wood products segments extend credit to numerous customers who are heavily exposed to the effects of downturns in the housing market. unfavorable housing market conditions could result in financial failures of one or more of our significant customers, which could impair our ability to fully collect receivables from such customers and negatively affect our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.a significant portion of our sales are concentrated with a relatively small number of customers. for the year ended december31, 2012, our top ten customers represented approximately 29% of our sales, with one customer accounting for approximately 11% of sales. at december31, 2012 and june30, 2013, receivables from such customer accounted for approximately 14% and 16%, respectively, of total receivables. although we believe that our relationships with our customers are strong, the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.our ability to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs is subject to various risks. our ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness and fund other liquidity needs depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets as well as the other risks described herein. in particular, demand for our products correlates to a significant degree to the level of residential construction activity in north america, which historically has been characterized by significant cyclicality. over the last several years, housing starts remained below historical levels. this reduced level of building was caused, in part, by an increase in the inventory of homes for sale, a more restrictive mortgage market, and a slowed economy. there can be no assurance as to when or if the housing market will rebound to historical levels. we have experienced significant losses from operations and used significant cash for operating activities in recent periods. we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. if we are unable to service our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we could be forced to curtail our operations, reorganize our capital structure, or liquidate some or all of our assets.we are subject to environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures, as well as other potential environmental liabilities. our businesses are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific environmental laws and regulations, particularly with respect to air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management and site remediation. enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, including those aimed at addressing greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant expenditures or restrict operations. from time to time, legislative bodies and environmental regulatory agencies may promulgate new regulatory programs imposing significant incremental operating costs or capital costs on us. in december 2012, the u.s. environmental protection agency (the "epa") finalized a revised series of four regulations commonly referred to collectively as boiler mact, which are intended to regulate the emission of hazardous air pollutants from industrial boilers. facilities in our wood products segment will be subject to one or more of these regulations and must be in compliance with the applicable rules by early 2016. we are currently undertaking a complete review of the revised rules to assess how they will affect our operations. even with the revised rules finalized, considerable uncertainty still exists, as there will likely be legal challenges to the final rules from industry and/or environmental organizations. notwithstanding that uncertainty, we are proceeding with efforts to analyze the applicability and requirements of the regulations, including the capital and operating costs required to comply. at this time, we cannot accurately forecast the capital or operating cost changes that may result from compliance with the regulations. as an owner and operator of real estate, we may be liable under environmental laws for the cleanup of past and present spills and releases of hazardous or toxic substances on or from our properties and operations. we could be found liable under these laws whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such substances. in some cases, this liability may exceed the value of the property itself. we may be unable to generate funds or other sources of liquidity and capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures to the extent we are not indemnified by third parties. for example, in connection with the completion of our acquisition of the forest products and paper assets of officemax in 2004 (the "forest products acquisition"), officemax is generally obligated to indemnify us for hazardous substance releases and other environmental violations that occurred prior to the forest products acquisition. however, officemax may not have sufficient funds to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations when required, and in some cases, we may not be contractually entitled to indemnification by officemax. in addition, in connection with the sale of our paper and packaging&amp; newsprint assets in 2008, boiseinc. and its affiliates assumed any and all environmental liabilities arising from our ownership or operation of the assets and businesses sold to them, and we believe we are entitled to indemnification by them from third-party claims in the event they fail to fully discharge any such liabilities on the basis of common law rules of indemnification. however, boiseinc. may not have sufficient funds to discharge its obligations when required or to indemnify us from third-party claims arising out of any such failure. for additional information on how environmental regulation and compliance affects our business, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsenvironmental." labor disruptions or increased labor costs could adversely affect our business. as of october13, 2013, we had approximately 5,210 employees. approximately 27% of these employees work pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. as of october13, 2013, we had nine collective bargaining agreements. two agreements, covering 375 employees at our facility in florien, louisiana, and 283 employees at our facility in oakdale, louisiana, expired on july15, 2013 but have been indefinitely extended by the parties, subject to either party submitting a ten-day written notice to terminate. we expect these two agreements to be negotiated together. if these agreements are not renewed or extended upon their expiration, we could experience a material labor disruption or significantly increased labor costs, which could prevent us from meeting customer demand or reduce our sales and profitability.if our long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record noncash impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations. we review the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. should the markets for our products deteriorate further or should we decide to invest capital differently than as expected, or should other cash flow assumptions change, it is possible that we will be required to record noncash impairment charges in the future with respect to the investments we have completed and expect to complete, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes restrict, and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness in the future may restrict, our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies. our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes contain, and any future indebtedness of ours may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose customary operating and financial restrictions on us. our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, among other things, to: incur additional debt; declare or pay dividends, redeem stock, or make other distributions to stockholders; make investments; create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; sell or transfer certain assets; and make prepayments on our senior notes and subordinated indebtedness. in addition, our revolving credit facility provides that if an event of default occurs or excess availability under our revolving credit facility drops below a threshold amount equal to the greater of 10% of the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility or $35million (and until such time as excess availability for two consecutive fiscal months exceeds that threshold amount and no event of default has occurred and is continuing), we will be required to maintain a monthly minimum fixed coverage charge ratio of 1.0:1.0, determined on a trailing twelve-month basis. our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees. our key managers are important to our success and may be difficult to replace because they have an average of 30years of experience in forest products manufacturing and building materials distribution. while our senior management team has considerable experience, certain members of our management team are nearing or have reached normal retirement age. the failure to successfully implement succession plans could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or inadequate skill sets, which could adversely affect our business.our growth strategy includes pursuing strategic acquisitions. we may be unable to integrate efficiently acquired operations or complete successfully potential acquisitions. we may not be able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses, including chester wood productsllc and moncure plywoodllc, in an efficient and cost-effective manner or without significant disruption to our existing operations or realize expected synergies. acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including uncertainties as to the future financial performance of the acquired business, difficulties integrating acquired personnel into our business, the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers, difficulties in integrating different computer and accounting systems, exposure to unknown or unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, and the diversion of management attention and resources from existing operations. in the future, we may be unable to complete successfully potential acquisitions due to multiple factors, such as issues related to regulatory review of the proposed transactions. we may also be required to incur additional debt in order to consummate acquisitions, which debt may be substantial and may limit our flexibility in using our cash flow from operations. our failure to integrate future acquired businesses effectively or to manage other consequences of our acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.we rely on boiseinc. for many of our administrative services. in conjunction with the sale of our paper and packaging&amp; newsprint assets in 2008, we entered into an outsourcing services agreement, under which boiseinc. provides a number of corporate staff services to us. these services include information technology, accounting and human resource transactional services. most of the boiseinc. staff that provides these services are providing the same services they provided when they were our employees. on october25, 2013, packaging corporation of america ("pca") acquired all of the outstanding common shares of boiseinc. the outsourcing services agreement remains in place after pca's acquisition of boiseinc. and is currently set to expire on february22, 2015. we cannot be assured that the staff providing such services will remain with pca after the acquisition, or that there will not be a disruption in the continuity or level of service provided. if pca is unwilling or unable to provide services at the same quality levels as those services have been provided in the past, or we are unable to develop and implement effective alternatives, if necessary, our business and compliance activities and results of operations could be substantially and negatively affected. risks relating to ownership of our common stockthe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them. the market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including: our operating and financial performance and prospects; our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry; the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the sec; changes in, or failure to meet, earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other companies in our industry; the failure of research analysts to cover our common stock; general economic, industry and market conditions; strategic actions by us, our customers or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; material litigation or government investigations; changes in general conditions in the u.s. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events; changes in key personnel; sales of common stock by us, our principal stockholder or members of our management team; termination of lock-up agreements with our management team and principal stockholder; the granting or exercise of employee stock options; volume of trading in our common stock; and the impact of the facts described elsewhere in "risk factors." in addition, in recent years, the stock market has regularly experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.the requirements of being a public company have increased certain of our costs and require significant management focus. we completed our initial public offering in february 2013 and boise cascade common stock is listed on the nyse. as a public company, our legal, accounting and other expenses associated with compliance-related and other activities have increased. for example, in connection with our initial public offering, we created new board committees and appointed an additional independent director to comply with the corporate governance requirements of the nyse. costs to obtain director and officer liability insurance contribute to our increased costs. as a result of the associated liability, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt even more changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase our compliance costs. until certain applicable phase-in periods expire, we are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements since we were a "controlled company" within the meaning of the nyse rules and, as a result, you will not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements. until july30, 2013, when bc holdings ceased to hold a majority of our common stock, we were considered a "controlled company" for the purposes of the nyse listing requirements. under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by a group is a "controlled company" and may elect not to comply with certain nyse corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that our board of directors, our compensation committee and our corporate governance and nominating committee meet the standard of independence established by those corporate governance requirements. we have one year from the date we ceased to be a controlled company to fully comply with all of nyse's corporate governance requirements. accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse's corporate governance requirements until the applicable phase-in periods expire.our significant stockholder, bc holdings, has the ability to influence corporate activities and its interests may not coincide with yours. after the consummation of this offering, bc holdings will beneficially own approximately 22.4% of our outstanding common stock, assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares. if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, bc holdings will beneficially own approximately 19.8% of our outstanding common stock. as a result of its ownership, bc holdings (and madison dearborn as its indirect controlling equityholder) has the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and, through our board of directors, the ability to influence decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies. matters over which bc holdings, directly or indirectly, has the ability to influence decision-making include: election of directors; mergers and other business combination transactions, including proposed transact</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the remainder of this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are intended to highlight risks that are specific to us and are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, such as those that generally apply to business enterprises in our industry, also may impair our business operations. Our future profitability is uncertain due to our limited operating historyWe have a limited operating history and cannot assure you that our revenue will continue to grow or that we will maintain profitability in the future. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies in the early stages of development. We rely substantially on sales of our MeetingPlace products, which have limited market acceptanceIn addition, we are unable to predict our future product development, sales and marketing, and administrative expenses. To the extent that these expenses increase, we will need to increase revenue to sustain profitability. Our ability to increase revenue and sustain profitability also depends on the other risk factors described in this section. Our operating results may fluctuate significantlyOur operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock would likely decline. The factors that may cause fluctuations of our operating results include the following: . changes in our mix of revenues generated from product sales and services; . changes by existing customers in their levels of purchases of our products and services; . changes in our mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold; and . changes in our mix of domestic and international salesOrders at the beginning of each quarter typically do not equal expected revenue for that quarter. In addition, a significant portion of our orders are received in the last month of each fiscal quarter. If we fail to ship products by the end of a quarter in which the order is received, or if our prospective customers delay their orders or delivery schedules until the following quarter, we may fail to meet our revenue objectives. 6 Our market is highly competitiveBecause of intense market competition, we may not be successful. Currently, our principal competitors include: . major telecommunications carriers that operate service bureaus for voice conferencing, such as AT&amp;T Corp., MCI Worldcom, Inc. and Sprint Corporation; . private branch exchange, or PBX, vendors that sell systems with voice conferencing capabilities, such as Lucent Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks; . providers of video conferencing systems such as PictureTel Corporation, Pinnacle Systems, Inc. and 8x8, Inc.; and . smaller start-up companies that offer web-based voice and data conferencing productsMany of these companies have longer operating histories, stronger brand names and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. These companies also may have existing relationships with many of our prospective customers. In addition, these companies may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirementsIn addition, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future which could adversely affect our ability to increase sales, penetrate new markets and maintain average selling prices. In the future, we may experience competition from potential competitors that include: . networking companies, such as Cisco Systems, Inc., 3Com Corporation, Lucent Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks that are focusing on enabling the transmission of voice over the Internet and that may offer voice and data conferencing functionality; and . collaborative software providers, such as Microsoft Corporation and Lotus Development Corporation, that are focusing on data conferencing products and that may in the future incorporate voice conferencing functionality into their products. Our market is in an early stage of development, and our products may not be adoptedIf the market for our integrated voice and data conferencing products fails to grow or grows more slowly than we anticipate, we may not be able to increase revenues or remain profitable. The market for integrated real-time voice and data conferencing is relatively new and rapidly evolving. Our ability to remain profitable depends in large part on the widespread adoption by end users of real-time voice and data conferencingWe will have to devote substantial resources to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products. In addition, businesses that have invested substantial resources in other conferencing products may be reluctant or slow to adopt our products, which might replace or compete with their existing systems. Our efforts to educate potential customers may not result in our products achieving market acceptance. 7 Rapid technological changes could cause our products to become obsolete or require us to redesign our productsThe market in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards. In particular, we expect that the growth of the Internet and Internet-based telephony applications, as well as general technology trends such as migrations to new operating systems, will require us to adapt our product to remain competitive. This adaptation could be costly and time-consuming. Our products could become obsolete and unmarketable if products using new technologies are introduced and new industry standards emerge. For example, the widespread acceptance of competing technologies, such as video conferencing and the transmission of voice over the Internet, could diminish demand for our current products. As a result, the life cycle of our products is difficult to estimateTo be successful, we will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards, such as the transmission of voice over the Internet, in a timely manner and on a cost effective basis. In addition, our current full care support agreements with our customers require us to deliver two product upgrades per year. We cannot assure you that we will successfully develop these types of products and product enhancements or that our products will achieve broad market acceptance. Our sales cycle is lengthy and unpredictableAny delay in sales of our products could cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. The typical sales cycle of our products is lengthy, generally between six to nine months, unpredictable, and involves significant investment decisions by prospective customers, as well as our education of potential customers regarding the use and benefits of our products. Furthermore, many of our prospective customers have neither budgeted expenses for voice and data conferencing systems nor have personnel specifically dedicated to procurement and implementation of these conferencing systems. As a result, our customers spend a substantial amount of time before purchasing our products in performing internal reviews and obtaining capital expenditure approvals. We cannot be certain that this cycle will not lengthen in the future. The emerging and evolving nature of the real-time voice and data conferencing market may lead to confusion in the market, which may cause prospective customers to postpone their purchase decisions. In addition, general concerns regarding Year 2000 compliance may further delay purchase decisions by prospective customers. If we fail to expand our sales and distribution channels, our business could sufferIf we are unable to expand our sales and distribution channels, we may not be able to increase revenue or achieve market acceptance of our MeetingPlace product. We have recently expanded our direct sales force and plan to recruit additional sales personnel. New sales personnel will require training and take time to achieve full productivity, and there is strong competition for qualified sales personnel in our business. In addition, we believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners. To date, we have entered into agreements with only a small number of these distribution partners. We cannot be certain that 8 we will be able to reach agreement with additional distribution partners on a timely basis or at all, or that these distribution partners will devote adequate resources to selling our products. Furthermore, if our distribution partners fail to adequately market or support our products, the reputation of our products in the market may suffer. In addition, we will need to manage potential conflicts between our direct sales force and third-party reselling efforts. Our ability to expand into international markets is uncertainWe intend to continue to expand our operations into new international markets. In addition to general risks associated with international expansion, such as foreign currency fluctuations and political and economic instability, we face the following risks and uncertainties any of which could prevent us from selling our products in a particular country or harm our business operations once we have established operations in that country: . the difficulties and costs of localizing products for foreign markets, including the development of multilingual capabilities in our MeetingPlace system; . the need to modify our products to comply with local telecommunications certification requirements in each country; and . our lack of a direct sales presence in other countries, our need to establish relationships with distribution partners to sell our products in these markets and our reliance on the capabilities and performance of these distribution partners. If we fail to integrate our products with third-party technology, our sales could sufferOur products are designed to integrate with our customers' data and voice networks, as well as with enterprise applications such as browsers and collaborative software applications. If we are unable to integrate our products with these networks and systems, sales of our products could suffer In addition, we may be required to engage in costly and time-consuming redesigns of our products because of technology enhancements or upgrades of these systems. We may not be able to redesign our products or be certain that any of these redesigns will achieve market acceptance. In addition, we will need to continually modify our products as newer versions of the enterprise applications with which our products integrate are introduced. Our ability to do so largely depends on our ability to gain access to the advanced programming interfaces for these applications, and we cannot assure you that we will have access to necessary advanced programming interfaces in the future. We may experience difficulties managing our expected growthOur recent growth has strained, and we expect that any future growth will continue to strain, our management systems and resources, which could hinder our ability to continue to grow in the future. We may also experience difficulties meeting the demand for our products and services. If we are unable to provide training and support for our products, the implementation process will be longer and customer satisfaction may be lowerWe may not be able to install management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner, and our current or planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be 9 adequate to support our future operations. Competition for qualified personnel in the San Francisco Bay area, as well as other markets in which we recruit, is extremely intense and characterized by rapidly increasing salaries, which may increase our operating expenses or hinder our ability to recruit qualified candidates. Our business could suffer if we lose the services of our current management teamOur future success depends on the ability of our management to operate effectively, both individually and as a group. If we were to lose the services of any of these key employees we may encounter difficulties finding qualified personnel to replace them In addition, three of our seven executive officers joined us during the past 12 months. Accordingly, our executive officers' ability to function effectively as a management team remains unproven. The loss of our right to use technology licensed to us by third parties could harm our businessWe license technology that is incorporated into our products from third parties, including digital signal processing algorithms and the MeetingPlace server's operating system and relational database. Any interruption in the supply or support of any licensed software could disrupt our operations and delay our sales, unless and until we can replace the functionality provided by this licensed software. Because our products incorporate software developed and maintained by third parties, we depend on these third parties to deliver and support reliable products, enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. Any interruption in supply of components from outside manufacturers and suppliers could hinder our ability to ship products in a timely mannerWe rely on third parties to obtain most of the components of the MeetingPlace server and integrate them with other standard components, such as the central processing unit and disk drives. If these third parties are no longer able to supply and assemble these components or are unable to do so in a timely manner, we may experience delays in shipping our products and have to invest resources in finding an alternative manufacturer or manufacture our products internallyIn addition, we obtain key hardware components, including the processors and digital signal processing devices used in the MeetingPlace server, from sole source suppliers. In the past, we have experienced problems in obtaining some of these components in a timely manner from these sources, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to obtain an adequate supply of these components in a timely manner or, if necessary, from alternative sources. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components or to locate alternative sources of supply, we may experience delays in shipping our products and incur additional costs to find an alternative manufacturer or manufacture our products internally. Our products may suffer from defects, errors or breaches of securitySoftware and hardware products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Any errors or defects 10 that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our customer relationships or reputation or increased service and warranty cost. Our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun, and we are aware of instances in which some of our customers have experienced product failures or errorsMany of our customers conduct confidential conferences, and transmit confidential data, using MeetingPlace. Concerns over the security of information sent over the Internet and the privacy of its users may inhibit the market acceptance of our products. In addition, unauthorized users in the past have gained, and in the future may be able to gain, access to our customers' MeetingPlace systems. Any compromise of security could deter people from using MeetingPlace and could harm our reputation and business and result in claims against us. We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, and we may be subject to infringement claimsUnauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, which could cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States In the future, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement of third party proprietary rights. Any of these claims, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, divert management's attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us. Parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could prevent us from selling our productsDell Computer Corporation has registered the "Latitude" mark for computers in the United States and in other countries. Dell's United States trademark registration and Canadian application have blocked our ability to register the "Latitude Communications" and "Latitude" with logo marks in the United States and the "Latitude Communications" mark in Canada. Since we believe that we have priority of trade name usage in the United States, we have petitioned to cancel Dell's United States registration and opposed its Canadian application. The outcome of these proceedings is uncertain. If Dell's registration for the "Latitude" mark is not canceled or if we are unable to obtain consent from Dell for our registration of our marks, we may not be able to register our marks and would have to rely solely on common law protection for these marks. We cannot assure you that we will be free from challenges of or obstacles to our use or registration of our marks. We are subject to government regulation, and our failure to comply with these regulations could harm our businessOur products are subject to a wide variety of safety, emissions and compatibility regulations imposed by governmental authorities in the United States or in other countries in which we sell our products. If we are unable to obtain necessary approvals or maintain compliance with the regulations of any particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from selling our products in that territory. In addition, to sell our products in many international markets, we are required to obtain certifications that are specific to the local telephony infrastructure. 11 We may be subject to claims related to Year 2000 issues, and Year 2000 concerns could adversely affect our revenuesMany currently installed computer systems are not capable of distinguishing 21st century dates from 20th century dates. As a result, beginning on January 1, 2000, computer systems and software used by many companies and organizations in a wide variety of industries, including technology, transportation, utilities, finance and telecommunications, will produce erroneous results or fail unless they have been modified or upgraded to process date information correctly. Year 2000 compliance efforts may involve significant time and expense, and uncorrected problems could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may face claims based on Year 2000 issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system. We may also experience reduced sales of our products as potential customers reduce their budgets for voice and data conferencing products due to increased expenditures on their own Year 2000 compliance efforts. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure." Our stock price may be volatileWe expect that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results. These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low. In addition, due to the technology-intensive and emerging nature of our business, the market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to: . announcements of technological or competitive developments; . acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors; or . the gain or loss by us of significant orders. Our executive officers and directors and their affiliates own a large percentage of our voting stock and could control the voting power of the common stockOn completion of this offering, executive officers and directors and their affiliates will beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 58% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent transactions that would result in the change of control, which in turn could reduce the market price of our common stock. Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock priceAfter this offering, we will have outstanding 18,581,657 shares of common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market following this offering could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. All the shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable. Upon the expiration of arrangements between our stockholders and Latitude or the underwriters in which our stockholders have agreed not to sell or dispose of their Latitude common stock, all of the remaining 15,581,657 shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be eligible for sale in the public market 180 days following the date of this prospectus. Of these shares, 11,682,572 shares will be subject to volume limitations under federal securities laws. 12 If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could fall.

      <td>risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be harmed. in these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our financial position and need for additional capitalwe have incurred significant losses since inception, expect to incur significant and increasing losses for at least the next several years, and may never achieve or maintain profitability. we have incurred significant annual net operating losses in every year since our inception. we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing net operating losses for at least the next several years. our net losses were $13.4million and $29.8million for the years ended december31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and $10.6million for the three months ended march31, 2016. as of march31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $64.1million. we have not generated any revenues from product sales, have not completed the development of any product candidate and may never have a product candidate approved for commercialization. we have financed our operations to date primarily through private placements of our preferred stock. we have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expense to support such research and development. our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders' (deficit) equity and working capital. we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we: continue to develop and begin clinical trials with respect to sy-1425, including a phase2 clinical trial we expect to initiate in mid-2016; continue to develop sy-1365, including initiating a phase 1/2 clinical trial in the first half of 2017; initiate and continue research, preclinical and clinical development efforts for our preclinical programs; further develop our gene control platform; seek to identify and develop additional product candidates; acquire or in-license other product candidates or technologies; seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; establish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure in the future to commercialize various products for which we may obtain marketing approval, if any; require the manufacture of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and, potentially, commercialization; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire and retain additional personnel, such as clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and help us comply with our obligations as a public company; and add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development programs. our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we are, or any future collaborator is, able to obtain marketing approval for, and successfully commercialize, one or more of our product candidates. successful commercialization will require achievement of key milestones, including initiating and successfully completing clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we, or any of our future collaborators, may obtain marketing approval, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payors. because of the uncertainties and risks associated with these activities, we are unable to accurately predict the timing and amount of revenues, and if or when we might achieve profitability. we and any future collaborators may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, or any future collaborators do, we may never generate revenues that are large enough for us to achieve profitability. even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our pipeline of product candidates or continue our operations and cause a decline in the value of our common stock.we have a limited operating history, no products approved for sale and no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability. we commenced operations in 2011. our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing our company, developing our gene control platform and conducting preclinical research. we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully conduct clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial-scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. accordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, especially clinical stage biopharmaceutical companies such as ours. any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known or unknown factors in achieving our business objectives. we will eventually need to transition from a company with a development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. we may not be successful in such a transition. we expect our financial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. accordingly, you should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or annual periods as indications of future operating performance.we will need substantial additional funding, and if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts. developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we initiate clinical trials of sy-1425, advance the development of sy-1365, initiate new research and preclinical development efforts and seek marketing approval for any product candidates that we successfully develop. moreover, under license agreements with various licensors, we are obligated to make milestone payments upon the successful completion of specified development and commercialization activities. in addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate that we may successfully develop, we may incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of a future collaborator. furthermore, following the closing of this offering, we expect to incur significant additional costs associated with operating as a public company. accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. if we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts. we plan to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to fund our ongoing research and development efforts. we will be required to expend significant funds in order to advance the development of sy-1425 and sy-1365, as well as our other preclinical programs. in addition, while we may seek one or more collaborators for future development of our current product candidate or any future product candidates that we may develop for one or more indications, we may not be able to enter into a collaboration for any of our product candidates for such indications on suitable terms, on a timely basis or at all. in any event, the net proceeds of this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund all of the efforts that we plan to undertake or to fund the completion of development of our product candidates or our other preclinical programs. accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources. we do not have any committed external source of funds. adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. we believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents as of march31, 2016, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through mid-2018. our estimate as to how long we expect the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, to be able to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. further, changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including: the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of sy-1425 and sy-1365; research and preclinical development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop; our ability to enter into and the terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements; the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements; the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; the costs of acquiring potential new product candidates or technology; the costs of any physician education programs relating to selecting and treating genomically defined patient populations; the timing and amount of milestone and other payments due to licensors for patent and technology rights used in our development platform; revenue received from commercial sales, if any, of our current and future product candidates; our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development and establish a commercial infrastructure; the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and the costs of operating as a public company.raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, including purchasers of common stock in this offering, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates. we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our planned operations. to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms of these securities could include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that could adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. in addition, debt financing, if available, would result in fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, creating liens, redeeming stock or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. in addition, securing financing could require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management's ability to oversee the development of our product candidates. if we raise additional funds through collaborations or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. risks related to the discovery, development and commercialization of product candidatesour approach to the discovery and development of product candidates based on our gene control platform is novel and unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any products of commercial value. we are focused on discovering and developing medicines for the treatment of cancer and other diseases based upon our gene control platform. we are leveraging our platform to create a pipeline of gene control drug candidates for genomically defined patients whose diseases have not been adequately addressed to date by other genomics approaches and to design and conduct efficient clinical trials with a higher likelihood of success. while we believe that applying our gene control platform to create medicines for genomically defined patient populations may potentially enable drug research and clinical development that is more efficient than conventional small molecule drug research and development, our approach is both novel and unproven. because our approach is both novel and unproven, the cost and time needed to develop our product candidates is difficult to predict, and our efforts may not result in the discovery and development of commercially viable medicines. we may also be incorrect about the effects of our product candidates on the diseases of genomically defined patient populations, which may limit the utility of our approach or the perception of the utility of our approach. furthermore, our estimates of genomically defined patient populations available for study and treatment may be lower than expected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct clinical trials and may also adversely affect the size of any market for medicines we may successfully commercialize. we have not yet succeeded and may never succeed in demonstrating efficacy and safety for our current or any future product candidates in clinical trials or in obtaining marketing approval thereafter. for example, although we have discovered and evaluated compounds using our novel gene control platform, we have not yet advanced a compound into any phase of clinical development.our gene control platform may fail to help us discover and develop additional potential product candidates. a significant portion of the research that we are conducting involves identifying novel targets and points of intervention and developing new compounds using our gene control platform. the drug discovery that we are conducting using our gene control platform may not be successful in identifying compounds that have commercial value or therapeutic utility. our gene control platform may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield viable product candidates for clinical development or commercialization for a number of reasons, including: compounds created through our gene control platform may not demonstrate efficacy, safety or tolerability; potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance; competitors may develop alternative therapies that render our potential product candidates non-competitive or less attractive; or a potential product candidate may not be capable of being produced at an acceptable cost. our research programs to identify new product candidates will require substantial technical, financial and human resources, and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to identify new product candidates. if we are unable to identify suitable additional compounds for preclinical and clinical development, our ability to develop product candidates and obtain product revenues in future periods could be compromised, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.in the near term, we are dependent on the success of sy-1425 and sy-1365. if we are unable to initiate or complete the clinical development of, obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize sy-1425 or sy-1365, either alone or with a collaborator, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be substantially harmed. we currently have no products approved for sale and are investing a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of sy-1425 and sy-1365. our prospects are substantially dependent on our ability, or that of any future collaborator, to develop, obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize product candidates in one or more disease indications. the success of sy-1425 and sy-1365 will depend on several factors, including the following: initiation and successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials; a safety, tolerability and efficacy profile that is satisfactory to the u.s. food and drug administration, or fda, or any comparable foreign regulatory authority for marketing approval; timely receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; the performance of our future collaborators, if any; the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities; establishment of supply arrangements with third-party raw materials suppliers and manufacturers including with respect to the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient for sy-1425; establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain finished drug product that is appropriately packaged for sale; adequate ongoing availability of raw materials and drug product for clinical development and any commercial sales; obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the united states and internationally, including our ability to maintain our license agreement with tmrc, which we refer to as the tmrc license agreement; protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; successful launch of commercial sales following any marketing approval; a continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval; commercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; successful identification of biomarkers for patient selection; continued availability of appropriate tissue samples to enable the identification of novel targets in genomically defined subsets of patients; and our ability to compete with other therapies. many of these factors are beyond our control, including clinical development, the regulatory submission process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the manufacturing, marketing and sales efforts of any future collaborator. if we are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for and successfully commercialize sy-1425 or sy-1365, on our own or with any future collaborator, or experience delays as a result of any of these factors or otherwise, our business could be substantially harmed.if clinical trials of any future product candidates that we, or any future collaborators, may develop fail to satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy to the fda and other regulators, we, or any future collaborators, may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of these product candidates. we, and any future collaborators, are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the united states without obtaining marketing approval from the fda. foreign regulatory authorities, such as the european medicines agency, or the ema, impose similar requirements. we, and any future collaborators, must complete extensive preclinical development and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans before we will be able to obtain these approvals. clinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome. we cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. the clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any stage of product development, including failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of adverse events that are severe or medically or commercially unacceptable, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements and determination by the fda or any comparable foreign regulatory authority that a product candidate may not continue development or is not approvable. for example, a phase2 clinical trial of tamibarotene (sy-1425) for the treatment of late-stage non-small cell lung cancer, or nsclc, under a previous license between tmrc and a third party was terminated when interim data suggested that the primary endpoint of progression-free survival for 18months after starting therapy would not be reached. interim data also showed that tamibarotene combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy was associated with increased toxicity in this non-selected nsclc patient population. although we have no current plans to conduct studies of sy-1425 in nsclc or combine tamibarotene with paclitaxel and carboplatin in late-stage nsclc patients, we face a similar risk of failure in our planned clinical trials of sy-1425. it is possible that even if one or more of our product candidates has a beneficial effect, that effect will not be detected during clinical evaluation as a result of one or more of a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of our clinical trials. conversely, as a result of the same factors, our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any. similarly, in our clinical trials we may fail to detect toxicity of or intolerability caused by our product candidates, or mistakenly believe that our product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated when that is not in fact the case. any inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us, or any future collaborators, and impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. moreover, if we, or any future collaborators, are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond the trials and testing that we or they contemplate, if we, or they, are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, or the results of these trials or tests are unfavorable, uncertain or are only modestly favorable, or there are unacceptable safety concerns associated with our product candidates, we, or any future collaborators, may: incur additional unplanned costs; be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates; not obtain marketing approval at all; obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings; be subject to additional post-marketing testing or other requirements; or be required to remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval. our failure to successfully initiate and complete clinical trials of our product candidates and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates would significantly harm our business.adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, product candidates that we develop may be identified during development and could delay or prevent their marketing approval or limit their use. adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, sy-1425, sy-1365 or any future product candidates that we may develop could cause us, any future collaborators, an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. because gene control techniques are relatively new, side effects from gene control approaches may be unpredictable. tamibarotene has been observed to be associated with adverse events, such as mild or moderate dry skin, skin rash, headache and bone pain, as well as retinoic acid syndrome and elevated levels of cholesterol, lipids, liver function enzymes and white blood cells, which were severe in certain cases. furthermore, retinoids such as sy-1425 may cause birth defects and therefore may carry a warning on their label. other examples of retinoids, a class of chemical compounds that are related to vitamin a, include all trans retinoic acid or atra, retin-a, retinol (found in over-the-counter skin creams), isotretinoin and bexarotene. we have not yet tested sy-1365 in humans so the safety profile that sy-1365 will demonstrate in human clinical trials is unknown. if any of our product candidates is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we, or any future collaborators, may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that prevented further development of the compound.if we, or any future collaborators, experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials of our current product candidate or any future product candidates that we, or any future collaborators, may develop, potential clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented. we, or any future collaborators, may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization of our current product candidate or any future product candidates that we, or any future collaborators, may develop, including: regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us, any future collaborators or our or their investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; we, or any future collaborators, may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites; clinical trials of our product candidates may produce unfavorable or inconclusive results; we, or any future collaborators, may decide, or regulators may require us or them, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we, or any future collaborators, anticipate, patient enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we, or any future collaborators, anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we, or any future collaborators, anticipate; our estimates of the genomically defined patient populations available for study may be higher than actual patient numbers and result in our inability to sufficiently enroll our trials; the cost of planned clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; our third-party contractors or those of any future collaborators, including those manufacturing our product candidates or components or ingredients thereof or conducting clinical trials on our behalf or on behalf of any future collaborators, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us or any future collaborators in a timely manner or at all; patients that enroll in a clinical trial may misrepresent their eligibility to do so or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to drop the patients from the clinical trial, increase the needed enrollment size for the clinical trial or extend the clinical trial's duration; we, or any future collaborators, may have to delay, suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate; regulators or institutional review boards may require that we, or any future collaborators, or our or their investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their standards of conduct, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate or findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar product or product candidate; the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our, or any future collaborators', clinical trial designs or our or their interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials; the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we, or any future collaborators, enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies; the supply or quality of raw materials or manufactured product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions
