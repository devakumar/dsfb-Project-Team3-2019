    <th>RISK FACTORS The following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this Prospectus before purchasing the Common Stock offered by this Prospectus. Except for the historical information contained herein, the discussion contained in this Prospectus contains "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this Prospectus. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere herein.Competitive Market for Experienced Scientists. The Company's future success will depend to a significant extent on its ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled chemists and other scientists. The Company's ability to maintain, expand or renew existing engagements with its customers, enter into new engagements and provide additional services to its existing customers depends, in large part, on its ability to hire and retain scientists with the skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in drug discovery and development technologies. The Company believes that there is a shortage of, and significant competition for, scientists with the skills and experience in chemistry necessary to perform the services offered by the Company. The Company competes with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, combinatorial chemistry companies, contract research companies and research and academic institutions for new personnel. The inability to hire additional qualified personnel may materially adversely affect the Company's future growth. In addition, the Company's inability to hire additional qualified scientists may require an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new personnel. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in attracting, retaining or motivating its scientific personnel. Failure to attract, retain or motivate such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Business--Competition."Dependence on Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Industries and Clients; Risk of Cost Overruns. The Company has benefitted to date from the increasing trend of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource chemical research and development projects. A reversal or slowing of this trend could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company's contract revenues are highly dependent on research and development expenditures by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The Company's operations could be materially adversely affected by general economic downturns in its clients' industries, the impact of the current trend toward consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry or any decrease in research and development expenditures. In addition, historically, a substantial portion of the Company's revenue has been derived from contracts with a limited number of significant customers. For the year ended December 31, 1997, net contract revenue from the Company's three largest customers represented approximately 29%, 11% and 9% of total net contract revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 1998, net contract revenue from the Company's three largest customers represented approximately 18%, 17% and 15% of total net contract revenue, respectively. The Company's contracts generally are terminable upon 30, 60 or 90 days' notice by the customer. The Company's contracts may be terminated for a number of reasons, many of which may be beyond the Company's control, such as reduction or reallocation of a customer's research and development budget or change in a customer's overall financial condition. The loss of a large contract or multiple smaller contracts, or a significant decrease in revenue derived from such contracts, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of the Company's contracts for the provision of its services have a fixed price or are subject to a maximum fee. As a result, the Company bears the risk of cost overruns with respect to such contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to perform its obligations with respect to any such contracts within the prescribed fixed fees or applicable maximum fees. Significant cost overruns with respect to such contracts could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Business--Current Collaborations; Customers."Risks Related to the Allegra/Telfast Royalty. Under the terms of a license agreement, the Company has granted HMRI, formerly Marion Merrell Dow Inc., an exclusive, worldwide license in exchange for milestones and royalties to use the Company's patents relating to fexofenadine HCl, which is the active ingredient in a new, non-sedating antihistamine marketed and sold by HMRI as a prescription medicine. Fexofenadine HCl is 7 marketed under the brand name Allegra in the Americas and under the brand name Telfast elsewhere. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company's milestones and royalties from fexofenadine HCl were $2.5 million, or 23.8% of the Company's aggregate net contract revenue plus other operating revenue, and for the nine months ended September 30, 1998, the Company's milestones and royalties from fexofenadine HCl were $15.6 million, or 60.4% of the Company's aggregate net contract revenue plus other operating revenue. The Company's milestones and royalties from fexofenadine HCl for the nine months ended September 30, 1998 include $3.0 million in non-recurring milestone payments and $4.4 million in royalties related to prior periods and as a result such milestone payments and royalties may not be indicative of future amounts earned under the license agreement with HMRI. In particular, no further milestone payments are required under the agreement. The Company does not participate in the manufacturing, marketing or sale of fexofenadine HCl by HMRI and relies entirely on the efforts of HMRI to manufacture, market and sell this product. There can be no assurance that HMRI will continue to be successful in marketing and selling fexofenadine HCl, that fexofenadine HCl will continue to receive market acceptance or that the Company will continue to receive significant royalties from HMRI in accordance with the license agreement. In addition, there can be no assurance that a comparable or superior antihistamine to fexofenadine HCl will not be developed or that fexofenadine HCl will not be found to have unintended side effects which could cause the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") or other government regulatory authorities to require that HMRI withdraw fexofenadine HCl from the market in the U.S. or other countries or could adversely affect market acceptance of fexofenadine HCl. The failure of fexofenadine HCl to be marketed successfully, to continue to receive market acceptance or to generate significant royalties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event any of the Company's patents relating to fexofenadine HCl are subjected to successful challenge, royalties under the license agreement would be materially and adversely affected. See "--Proprietary Technology; Unpredictability of Patent Protection" and "Business--Allegra/Telfast Royalty and Licensing Agreement."Proprietary Technology; Unpredictability of Patent Protection. The Company's success will depend, in part, on its ability to obtain and enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties when necessary, and conduct its business without infringing the proprietary rights of others. The patent positions of pharmaceutical, medical products and biotechnology firms can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. There can be no assurance that any patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage, or will not be circumvented by others. In the event a third party has also filed one or more patent applications for inventions which conflict with those of the Company, the Company may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "PTO") to determine priority of invention, which could result in the loss of any opportunity to secure patent protection for the inventions and the loss of any right to use the inventions. Even if the eventual outcome is favorable to the Company, such proceedings could result in substantial cost to the Company. The filing and prosecution of patent applications, litigation to establish the validity and scope of patents, assertion of patent infringement claims against others and the defense of patent infringement claims by others can be expensive and time consuming. There can be no assurance that in the event that any claims with respect to any of the Company's patents, if issued, are challenged by one or more third parties, that any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will determine that such patent claims are valid and enforceable. An adverse outcome in such litigation could cause the Company to lose exclusivity afforded by the disputed rights. If a third party is found to have rights covering products or processes used by the Company, the Company could be forced to cease using the technologies covered by such rights, could be subject to significant liability to such third party, and could be required to license technologies from such third party. Furthermore, even if the Company's patents are determined to be valid, enforceable, and broad in scope, there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with the Company and its licensees using the resulting alternative technology. See "Business--Patents and Proprietary Rights."Management of Growth and Expansion. The Company's operations have grown rapidly and substantially in recent years. Such growth has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on the Company's operational, human and financial resources. The Company's ability to compete effectively will depend, in large part, upon its ability to hire, train and assimilate additional management, professional, scientific and technical 8 operating personnel and its ability to expand, improve and effectively utilize its operating, management, marketing and financial systems to accommodate its expanded operations. The physical expansion of the Company's facilities to accommodate future growth may lead to significant costs and divert management and business development resources. The failure by the Company's management to effectively anticipate, implement and manage the changes required to sustain the Company's growth may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.Dependence on Key Personnel. The Company's performance is highly dependent on the principal members of its senior management and scientific staff, including, in particular, Dr. Thomas E. D'Ambra, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Donald E. Kuhla, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Harold Meckler, the Company's Vice President, Chemical Development, and Dr. Michael P. Trova, the Company's Vice President, Medicinal Chemistry. Moreover, the responsibilities of the Company's senior management and scientific staff have recently increased since the departure in October 1998 of the Company's chief financial officer. The Company is actively seeking to hire a permanent chief financial officer. Although the Company has entered into agreements containing non-competition restrictions with its senior scientific and management personnel and into employment agreements with Drs. D'Ambra, Kuhla, Meckler and Trova, the Company does not have employment agreements with all of its key personnel. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to retain such personnel or attract and retain a new chief financial officer on a timely basis. The Company maintains key person life insurance on Dr. D'Ambra. The loss of one or more members of the Company's senior management or scientific staff, or the Company's inability to hire a permanent chief financial officer on a timely basis, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Business--Employees," "Management--Executive Officers, Directors and Key Employees" and "Certain Transactions."Competition. The Company faces competition based on a number of factors, including size, relative expertise and sophistication, speed and costs of identifying and optimizing potential lead compounds and of developing and optimizing chemical processes. The Company competes with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, combinatorial chemistry companies, contract research companies and research and academic institutions. Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources and more experience in research and development than the Company. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through arrangements with large corporate collaborators.Historically, pharmaceutical companies have maintained close control over their research and development activities, including the synthesis, screening and optimization of chemical compounds and the development of chemical processes. Many of these companies, which represent a significant potential market for the Company's products and services, are developing or already possess in-house technologies and services offered by the Company. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations are also conducting research in areas in which the Company provides services either independently or through collaborative efforts.The Company anticipates that it will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and advanced technologies become available. The Company's services and expertise may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or novel approaches developed by one or more of the Company's competitors. The existing approaches of the Company's competitors or new approaches or technologies developed by the Company's competitors may be more effective than those developed by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company's competitors will not develop more effective or more affordable technologies or services, thus rendering the Company's technologies and/or services obsolete, uncompetitive or uneconomical. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully with existing or potential competitors or that competitive factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. See "Business-- Competition."Variation in Quarterly Operating Results; Seasonality. The Company's results of operations historically have fluctuated on a quarterly basis and can be expected to continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Quarterly operating results can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the commencement, delay, cancellation or completion of contracts; risks associated with fixed price contracts; the mix of services provided; seasonal slowdowns; the timing of start-up expenses for new services and facilities; and the timing and 9 integration of acquisitions. In particular, quarterly fluctuations in the Company's royalty revenue relating to fexofenadine HCl, an anti-histamine subject to seasonal demand, may produce stronger fluctuations in the Company's results of operations than those which have occurred over prior periods. The Company believes that quarterly comparison of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. In addition, fluctuations in quarterly results could affect the market price of the Common Stock in a manner unrelated to the longer term operating performance of the Company. See "--Absence of a Public Trading Market; Offering Price; Possible Volatility of Future Stock Price" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Quarterly Results of Operations."Limited Marketing Experience; Expansion of Sales Activities. To date, the Company has sold its services and products primarily through the efforts of the Company's senior management. The Company anticipates that it will need to retain additional sales and marketing personnel and expand its sales and marketing activities in order to achieve significant long-term growth. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to build and maintain an efficient and effective sales and marketing organization or that such an organization will be successful in attracting new customers. The failure to build a successful sales organization could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.Potential Liability and Risks of Operations. The Company develops, tests and, to a very limited extent, manufactures pharmaceutical products intended for use in humans. Such activities could expose the Company to the risk of liability for personal injury or death to persons using such products, although the Company does not manufacture in bulk, market or sell such products. No assurance can be given that the Company will not be required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any such claim. The Company currently maintains product liability insurance with respect to these risks. No assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate or can be maintained at acceptable costs or at all. The failure of such insurance policies to protect the Company from such claims or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.All facilities and manufacturing techniques used in the manufacture of products for clinical use or for sale in the United States must be operated in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") guidelines as established by the FDA. The Company's facilities are subject to scheduled periodic regulatory inspections to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements. Failure on the part of the Company to comply with applicable requirements could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities. A finding that the Company had materially violated cGMP requirements could result in additional regulatory sanctions and, in severe cases, could result in a mandated closing of the Company's facilities which would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.Risk of Interruption of Operations. The Company's results of operations are dependent upon the continued use of its highly specialized laboratories and equipment. The Company's operations are primarily concentrated in a single facility in Albany, New York. Although the Company has contingency plans in effect for certain natural disasters, as well as other unforeseen events which could damage the Company's laboratories or equipment, no assurance can be given that any such events will not materially interrupt the Company's business. The Company maintains business interruption insurance to cover lost revenues caused by such occurrences. However, such insurance would not compensate the Company for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with existing customers created by an inability to complete its customer contracts in a timely manner.Risks Associated with Acquisitions. The Company from time to time reviews potential acquisition candidates in the ordinary course of its business. No assurance can be given that acquisition candidates will be available or will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including among others, difficulties and expenses incurred in connection with the consummation of such acquisitions by the Company and the subsequent assimilation of the operations, personnel and services or products of the acquired companies, the difficulty of operating new businesses, the diversion of management's 10 attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company. Acquisitions of foreign companies may also involve the additional risks of assimilating differences in business practices and overcoming language barriers. To date, the Company has grown entirely through internal expansion, and there can be no assurance that any acquisition will be identified or completed or, if completed, will be successfully integrated into the Company's operations. The Company presently has no agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisition.Broad Management Discretion in Use of Proceeds. The principal purposes of the offering are to increase the Company's equity capital, to create a public market for the Company's Common Stock, to increase the visibility of the Company in the marketplace and to facilitate future access by the Company to public equity markets. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of its indebtedness, for additional capital expenditures and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company has not, however, identified specific uses for a significant portion of the net proceeds of the offering. Accordingly, the Company's management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering. Although the Company has no plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions as of the date of this Prospectus, the Company may seek acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies that are complementary to those of the Company, and a portion of the net proceeds may be used for such acquisitions. See "Use of Proceeds."Potential Adverse Impact of Pharmaceutical and Health Care Reform. The Company expects that a substantial portion of its contract revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived from services provided to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Accordingly, the Company's future success is directly dependent upon the success of the companies within those industries and their continued demand for the Company's services. The levels of revenues and profitability of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means and the initiatives of third party payors with respect to the availability of reimbursement. For example, in certain foreign markets pricing or profitability of pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the United States, there have been, and the Company expects that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government control. It is uncertain what legislative proposals may be adopted or what actions federal, state or private third party payors for health care goods or services may take in response to any health care reform proposals or legislation. To the extent that such proposals or reforms have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations and profitability of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actual or prospective customers for the Company's services and products, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Potential Liability Regarding Hazardous Materials. The research and development processes of the Company involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, the Company could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could exceed the resources of the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations related to the handling or disposal of such materials or waste products in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.Effective Control by Principal Stockholders. After giving effect to the sale of the shares of Common Stock offered hereby, Thomas E. D'Ambra, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Chester J. Opalka, the Company's Vice President, Senior Research Chemist and a Director, will beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 51.8% (50.3% assuming exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment option in full) of the outstanding Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exert significant influence over the outcome of fundamental corporate transactions requiring stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, mergers and sales of assets and the election of the members of the Company's Board of Directors. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. See "Principal Stockholders" and "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." 11Shares Eligible for Future Sale. Sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market after this offering could adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. In addition to the 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock offered hereby, up to approximately 9,979,561 shares of Common Stock owned by current stockholders of the Company will be eligible for sale in the public market pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), at various times beginning 90 days after the date of this Prospectus. Executive officers, directors and stockholders of the Company who in the aggregate hold 9,954,999 shares of Common Stock and options to purchase 1,861,101 shares of Common Stock have agreed, pursuant to certain Lock-up Agreements (the "Lock-up Agreements"), that until 180 days after the date of this Prospectus, they will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, assign, transfer, encumber, contract to sell, grant an option to purchase, make a distribution of, or otherwise dispose of, any shares of Common Stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, otherwise than (i) as a bona fide gift or gifts, provided that the donee or donees thereof agree in writing as a condition precedent to such gift or gifts to be bound by the terms of the Lock-up Agreements, or (ii) with the prior written consent of ING Baring Furman Selz LLC. Sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock (including shares issued in connection with future acquisitions which may be issued with registration rights), or the availability of such shares for sale, may adversely affect the prevailing market price for the Common Stock and could impair the Company's ability to obtain additional capital through an offering of its equity securities. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale."Absence of a Public Trading Market; Offering Price; Possible Volatility of Future Stock Price. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock, and there can be no assurance that an active market will develop or be sustained following the consummation of this offering. Consequently, the offering price of the Common Stock will be determined by negotiation between the Company and the representatives of the several Underwriters based on several factors and will not necessarily reflect the market price of the Common Stock after this offering or the price at which the Common Stock may be sold in the public market after this offering. See "Underwriting" for a description of the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price. Following the completion of this offering, the trading price of the Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in the Company's operating results, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, material announcements by the Company or its competitors, governmental regulatory action, or other events or factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected market prices of smaller capitalization companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. In addition, the Company's operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In such event, the price of the Common Stock would likely decline, perhaps substantially. See "Underwriting."Computer Systems and Year 2000 Issues. The "Year 2000" issue concerns the potential exposures related to the automated generation of business and financial misinformation resulting from the application of computer programs which have been written using two digits, rather than four, to define the application year of business transactions. The Company's independent information technology consultant has conducted a comprehensive assessment of the Company's computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the Year 2000, and has determined that no material changes are required for the Company's computer systems to be Year 2000 compliant. As such, the Company believes that, based upon currently available information, it will incur no material costs associated with becoming Year 2000 compliant. The Company is seeking to confirm the Year 2000 readiness of its material customers (such as Astra AB and Eli Lilly and Company), its key licensees (such as HMRI) and its material vendors. Failure of the Company, its software providers or the Company's customers or vendors to adequately address the Year 2000 issue could result in misstatement of reported financial information or otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.Dividend Policy. The Company has not declared cash dividends on its Common Stock since its inception and the Company does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Under Delaware law, the Company is permitted to pay dividends only out of its surplus, or, if there is no surplus, out of its net profits. Although the Company's current credit facility permits the Company to pay cash dividends, 12 the payment of cash dividends may be prohibited under agreements governing debt which the Company may incur in the future. See "Dividend Policy" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."Anti-takeover Provisions. Certain provisions of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate") and Amended and Restated By- laws (the "By-laws"), certain sections of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to establish the voting rights, preferences and other terms thereof, may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may discourage takeover attempts not first approved by the Board of Directors (including takeovers which stockholders may deem to be in their best interests). Such provisions include, among other things, a classified Board of Directors serving staggered three-year terms, the elimination of stockholder voting by written consent, the removal of directors only for cause, the vesting of exclusive authority in the Board of Directors to determine the size of the Board of Directors and (subject to certain limited exceptions) to fill vacancies thereon, the vesting of exclusive authority in the Board of Directors (except as otherwise required by law) to call special meetings of stockholders, and certain ad</th>

    <th>risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and all other information contained in this prospectus before you decide to invest in our common stock. if any of the following risk factors, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our businesswe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and if we are unable to maintain these customer relationships or attract additional customers, our revenue will be adversely affected. for the years ended december31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, revenue from bmw ag and harman international industries,inc., our top two customers, accounted for approximately 30%, 28% and 29%, respectively, of our total revenue. in addition, during those three years, sales to our top 15 customers accounted for approximately 80%, 75% and 75% of our revenue, respectively. for the quarter ended march28, 2004, revenue from our top two customers accounted for approximately 29% of our total revenue and sales to our top 15customers accounted for approximately 75% of our revenue. although we have achieved some success in expanding our customer base, we anticipate that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future. in addition, although we have contractual arrangements with most of our key customers, the majority of these arrangements are not long term and generally do not obligate our key customers to make any minimum or specified level of purchases. therefore, our relationships with these key customers may or may not continue in the future, and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of revenue from them. we cannot assure you that our revenue from our current customers will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. the loss of one or more of our key customers, or fewer or smaller orders from them, would adversely affect our revenue.we have historically incurred operating losses and we may not achieve sustained profitability. prior to the year ended december31, 2002, we had been unprofitable on an annual basis since our inception. for the years ended december31, 2000 and 2001, we had operating losses of $51.3million and $28.9million, respectively, and net losses of $109.6million and $116.5million, respectively. as of march28, 2004, we had an accumulated deficit of $512.1million. although we have achieved an operating profit and a net profit in each of the last two fiscal years, we cannot assure you that our revenue will continue to grow at its current rate or that we will be able to maintain profitability in the future.the market for products and services incorporating our map database is evolving and its rate of growth is uncertain. our success depends upon our customers' abilities to successfully market and sell their products incorporating our database. continued growth in the adoption of route guidance products in the automotive industry and in the consumer mobile devices industry (in products such as personal digital assistants, wireless telephones, personal navigation devices and laptop computers), additional technological improvements in wireless devices, such as inclusion of gps capabilities in mobile devices and increases in functional memory, and continued development by our current and potential customers of dynamic navigation, route planning, location-based information, asset tracking and other geographic-related products and services incorporating our database, are critical to our future growth. if our customers do not continue to successfully develop and market new products and services incorporating our database, or the products that our customers develop and market do not meet consumer expectations, our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected. growth in the market for vehicle navigation products and services historically has occurred first in europe and then in north america. if the market growth in north america is not consistent with the growth we have experienced in europe, our ability to grow our revenue will be adversely affected.our product offering is not diversified and if we attempt to diversify, we may not be successful. our map database is our principal product, and a substantial majority of our revenue is attributable to the licensing of our database for route guidance applications. consequently, if the market for existing and new products and services incorporating our database declines or does not continue to grow, our business would be seriously harmed because we currently do not have additional products or services that would generate sufficient revenue to enable us to sustain our business while seeking new markets and applications for our database. in addition, any attempt by us to diversify our product and service offerings may not be successful and may cause us to divert resources and management attention away from our core business, which could adversely affect our financial position, reputation and relationships with our customers.if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our profitability and ability to implement our strategy will be adversely affected. our continued growth has and will continue to place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. to accommodate this growth and successfully execute our strategy, we will need to continue to hire additional qualified personnel and implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems and internal operating and financial controls and procedures throughout our company. our inability to expand and integrate these additions and upgrades in an efficient and timely manner could cause our expenses to increase, revenue to decline and could otherwise adversely affect our profitability and ability to implement our strategy.we derive the majority of our revenue from the use of our map database in vehicle navigation systems and fluctuations in the condition of the automotive market may result in fluctuations in the demand for products incorporating our database. the use of our database in vehicle navigation systems, which we supply directly and indirectly to automobile manufacturers, historically has accounted for a substantial majority of our revenue. approximately 82%, 82% and 83% of our revenue for the years ended december31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, and approximately 85% of our revenue for the quarter ended march28, 2004, were generated by the sale of our database for use in new automobiles equipped with navigation systems. any significant downturn in the demand for these products would materially decrease our revenue. the automotive market historically has experienced fluctuations due to increased competition, economic conditions and circumstances affecting the global market for automobiles generally, and additional fluctuations are likely to occur in the future. to the extent that our future revenue depends materially on sales of new automobiles equipped with navigation systems enabled by digital maps, our business may be vulnerable to these fluctuations.our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our license fees. our profitability depends significantly on the prices we are able to charge customers for our data and other services. the license fees we charge our customers are affected by a number of factors, including: our customers' perception of the quality of our data and other products and services; the proliferation of navigation applications in lower-cost products and services and market acceptance of those products and services; our customers' expectations of lower license fees as a result of economies of scale, customer-imposed efficiency improvements and decreases in prices of hardware and software incorporating our database; competition; advances in technology that reduce the cost of geographic data acquisition; introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors; pricing policies of our competitors; price sensitivity of end-users of navigation products and services; and general economic conditions. any one or a combination of these factors could cause a decline in our license fees and thus, adversely affect our revenue and profitability. in addition, the success of our pricing policies is based, in part, on our assessment of the evolution of the market for products and services incorporating navigation applications, which is uncertain, and our ability to correlate the price we charge for various uses of our database. if either our assessment of the market evolution or our price correlations turn out to be incorrect, then our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected. the automotive market and the market for mobile devices are highly competitive and manufacturers in these markets are continually looking for ways to reduce the costs of components included in their products in order to maintain or broaden consumer acceptance of those products. because our map database is a component incorporated in automotive, wireless telephone and handheld navigational systems, we face pressure, from time to time, from our customers to lower our database license fees. we have in the past, and may in the future, need to lower our license fees to preserve customer relationships or extend use of our database to a broader range of products. to the extent we lower our license fees in the future, we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve related increases in the use of our database or other benefits to offset fully the effects of these adjustments. in addition, increased competition has affected our ability to maintain the level of our prices. if price adjustments resulting from increased competition are not offset by increases in sales of our database, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins or loss of market share by us. the market for map information is highly competitive. we compete with other companies and governmental and quasi-governmental agencies that provide map information to a wide variety of users in a wide range of applications with varying levels of functionality. we currently have several major competitors in providing map information, including teleatlas n.v., geographic data technology, inc. (gdt) and numerous european governmental and quasi-governmental mapping agencies (e.g., ordnance survey in the united kingdom) that license map data for commercial use. teleatlas offers detailed map data for western europe. in addition, gdt and teleatlas are now offering more detailed map data for the united states than previously had been available from those companies, which enhances their ability to compete with us in the united states market. in july 2004, teleatlas acquired gdt and, as a result, it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively with the combined company. governmental and quasi-governmental agencies also are making more map data information available free of charge or at lower prices, which may encourage new market entrants or reduce the demand for fee-based products and services which incorporate our map database. in addition, some of our customers prefer to license data from several vendors in order to diversify their sources of supply and to maintain competitive and pricing pressures. increased competition from our current competitors or new market entrants (which may include our customers), actions taken by our customers to diversify their sources of supply and increase pricing pressure, the acquisition of gdt by teleatlas and other competitive pressures, may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins or loss of market share by us.our dependence on our vehicle navigation systems manufacturer customers for compilation services could result in a material decrease in our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business. for vehicle navigation systems, we rely on our vehicle navigation systems manufacturer customers to compile copies of our map database into their proprietary formats. this can be a time and labor intensive and complex process. in some cases, these customers also are responsible for distributing the compiled database to the automobile manufacturers. if these customers do not compile or distribute our map database in a timely manner and consistent with the requirements of the automobile manufacturers, our reputation and relationships with the automobile manufacturers could be adversely affected. in other cases, our navigation systems manufacturer customers compile our map database and then return a master copy to us. we then distribute copies of the database to the automobile manufacturers in exchange for a distribution fee. if these customers do not fulfill their obligations to us to compile our map database, or to the extent we have not entered into agreements clearly specifying their obligations or fail to do so in the future, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to automobile manufacturers, which could result in our contractual liability to these automobile manufacturers, and would likely decrease our revenue and adversely affect our business. our vehicle navigation systems manufacturer customers also could decide to not provide compilation services to us, which would prevent us from providing distribution services to the automobile manufacturers with respect to these customers' navigation systems, and would result in a material decrease in our revenue.we derive a significant portion of our revenue from our international operations and economic, political and other inherent risks of international operations may adversely affect our financial performance. we have approximately 110 field and administrative offices in 19 countries worldwide. we have substantial operations in europe. approximately 64%, 68% and 66% of our total revenue in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, and approximately 69% of our total revenue during the quarter ended march28, 2004 were attributable to our european operations. we expect a significant portion of our revenue and expenses will be generated by our european operations in the future. accordingly, our operating results are and will continue to be subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we also collect data in various foreign jurisdictions and outsource some software development and data production functions in foreign jurisdictions. the key risks to us of operating in foreign countries include: reduced or inadequate intellectual property protections and/or high rates of intellectual property piracy in some jurisdictions; multiple, conflicting, vague and changing laws and regulations, including tax laws, employment laws, governmental approvals, permits and licenses; restrictions on the movement of cash; general political and economic instability; restrictions on the import and export of technologies; price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies; trade barriers, including tariffs and other laws and practices that favor local companies; maintenance of quality standards for outsourced work; and difficulties and costs in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations, including cultural differences. we expect to continue to expand internationally into other countries and regions, including into emerging economies, where we believe that many of these risks are increased.currency translation risk and currency transaction risk may adversely affect our results of operations. material portions of our revenue and expenses have been generated by our european operations, and we expect that our european operations will account for a material portion of our revenue and expenses in the future. substantially all of our international expenses and revenue are denominated in foreign currencies, principally, the euro. as a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in europe and other foreign markets in which we have operations. accordingly, fluctuations in the value of those currencies in relation to the u.s. dollar have caused and will continue to cause dollar-translated amounts to vary from one period to another. in addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency in which it receives revenue and pays expenses. historically, we had not engaged in activities to hedge our foreign currency exposures. on april22, 2003, we entered into a foreign currency derivative instrument to hedge certain foreign currency exposures related to intercompany transactions. for the year ended december31, 2003 and the quarter ended march28, 2004, we generated approximately 66% and 69% of our total revenue, respectively, and incurred approximately 45% and 50% of our total costs, respectively, in foreign currencies. our european operations reported revenue of $181million and $55million for the year ended december31, 2003 and for the quarter ended march28, 2004, respectively. for the year ended december31, 2003, approximately $28million (or approximately 10%) of our revenue was a result of an increase in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, as compared to 2002, with every $0.01 change in the exchange ratio of the euro against the dollar resulting in a $1.6million change in our revenue and a $0.8million change in our operating income. for the quarter ended march28, 2004, approximately $6million (or approximately 7%) of our revenue was a result of an increase in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, as compared to the same period in 2003, with every $0.01 change in the exchange ratio of the euro against the dollar resulting in a $0.4million change in our revenue and a $0.2million change in our operating income. our analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the united states or europe. given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency translation and/or transaction risks, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.we are subject to income taxes in many countries because of our international operations and we exercise judgment in order to determine our provision for income taxes. because that determination is an estimate, we cannot be certain that our income tax provisions and accruals will be adequate. we are subject to income taxes in many countries, jurisdictions and provinces. our international operations require us to exercise judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes. regularly, we make estimates where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. while we believe our estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audit or tax-related litigation will not be materially different from that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the assessment of additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of audits, litigation or otherwise, could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition. we may not generate sufficient future taxable income to allow us to realize our deferred tax assets. we have a significant amount of tax loss carryforwards and interest expense carryforwards that will be available to reduce the taxes we would otherwise owe in the future. we have recognized the value of a portion of these future tax deductions in our consolidated balance sheet at march28, 2004. the realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income during the periods in which we are permitted, by law, to use those assets. we exercise judgment in evaluating our ability to realize the recorded value of these assets, and consider a variety of factors, including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. our evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets must consider both positive and negative evidence, and the weight given to the potential effects of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to which the evidence can be verified objectively. while we believe that sufficient positive evidence exists to support our determination that the realization of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not, we cannot assure you that we will have profitable operations in the future that will allow us to fully realize those assets.increased governmental regulation may place additional burdens on our business and adversely affect our ability to compete. although we do not believe governmental regulation has had a material effect on our business and operations to date, it is possible that we will experience the effects of increased regulation in the future. in the united states and europe, the combination of heightened security concerns and the increase in the breadth and accuracy of our map database could result in more restrictive laws and regulations, such as export control laws, applicable to our database. in addition, automobile safety initiatives may result in restrictions on devices that use our database. as we continue to expand our geographic coverage, policies favoring local companies and other regulatory initiatives may result in export control laws and other restrictions on our ability to access, collect and use map data or otherwise conduct business in various countries throughout the world. our failure to comply with local policies and regulations could result in a number of adverse consequences, including loss of access to map data, restrictions or prohibitions on our use of map information, financial penalties, criminal sanctions or loss of licenses or other authority to do business in those jurisdictions. any of these occurrences could adversely affect our ability to complete, improve, license or distribute our database, which could result in a competitive disadvantage for us and the possible loss of customers and revenue.if we cannot retain our existing management team or attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel, our business could be adversely affected. our success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our current executive officers, including judson c. green, president and chief executive officer, david b. mullen, executive vice president and chief financial officer, john k. macleod, executive vice president, global marketing and strategy and m. salahuddin khan, senior vice president, technology& development and chief technology officer and our other key employees, including management, sales, support, technical and services personnel. qualified employees are in high demand throughout technology-based industries, and our future success depends in significant part on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled employees and the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to work effectively as a team.if we fail to adapt our map database to changes in technology, we could lose our existing customers and be unable to attract new business. the market for products and services incorporating digital map information is evolving and is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, the introduction of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services. although our database currently can be used by our customers in a wide variety of applications, we will need to be able to maintain the compatibility of our map database with new products and services introduced as a result of technological changes. if we are unable to do so, demand for our database could decline and our revenue would be adversely affected.if we fail to establish and maintain relationships with third party sources of data used in our map database, our business is likely to suffer. we depend upon third party sources for data to build, maintain and enhance our database. in certain cases, this data is readily available only from limited third party sources and/or at significant cost. we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining our relationships with our current third party sources or that we will be able to continue to obtain data from them on acceptable terms or at all. we also cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable. in some cases, we may obtain data on less favorable terms in order to satisfy our customers' requirements. in addition, we may be unable to obtain data from additional sources that would allow us to enhance our existing coverage and expand our geographic coverage. our rights to use any data we obtain may be limited in scope and duration and subject to various other terms and restrictions that may reduce its usefulness to us. our inability to obtain data from our current sources or additional or alternative sources, or to use the acquired data for our intended purposes, may impair or delay the further development, updating and distribution of our database. any impairments or delays may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and cause us to lose revenue. further, if we must pay more for the data than we have in the past or acquire data on unfavorable terms to satisfy customer requirements, our profitability may be adversely affected.if our customers do not accurately report the amount of license fees owed to us, we will not receive all of the revenue to which we are entitled. except with respect to our automobile manufacturer customers for whom we make and distribute copies of our database, we rely on our customers to report the amount of license fees owed to us under our agreements with them. the majority of our agreements, including those with our key customers, give us the right to audit their records to verify this information. however, these audits can be expensive, time-consuming and possibly detrimental to our ongoing business relationships with our customers. as a result, to date we have only audited a small number of customers in any given year and have relied primarily on the accuracy of our customers' reports. to the extent those reports are inaccurate, the revenue we collect from our customers could be materially less than the amount we should be receiving from them. though we believe the revenue lost from underreporting has not been material historically, we cannot estimate the impact of underpayments in the future.errors or defects in the database we deliver to customers may expose us to risks of product liability claims and adversely affect our reputation, which could result in customer loss, decreased revenue, unexpected expenses and loss of market share. the use of our data in route guidance products and other navigation products and applications involves an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. claims could be made by our customers if errors or defects result in failure of their products or services, or by end-users of those products or services or others alleging loss or harm as a result of actual or perceived errors or defects in our map database. our potential exposure may increase as products and services incorporating our map database begin to be used more widely in emergency response or other safety-related applications and as the information included in earlier versions of our map database becomes dated or obsolete. in addition, errors or defects in our database may require us to participate in product recalls, or cause us to voluntarily initiate a recall in order to maintain good customer relationships. product liability claims present a risk of protracted litigation, substantial money damages, attorneys' fees, costs and expenses, and diversion of management's attention from the operation of our business. although we have not had any product liability claims brought against us to date, we cannot assure you that claims will not be brought in the future. we attempt to mitigate the risks of product liability claims through the use of disclaimers, limitations of liability and similar provisions in our license agreements; however, we cannot assure you that any of these provisions will prove to be effective barriers to claims. recalls also may be costly and divert management's attention from the operation of our business. in some circumstances, we are contractually obligated to indemnify our customers for liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of product liability claims. providing indemnification or contesting indemnification claims from our customers may result in our incurring substantial costs and expenses. in some cases, purchase orders submitted by our customers purport to incorporate certain customer-favorable contractual terms and conditions which, if given effect, could increase our potential product liability and recall liability exposure. in addition, adverse publicity may reduce our customers' willingness to incorporate our database and related applications into their products, which would adversely affect our revenue.our inability to adequately protect our map database property could enable others to market databases with similar coverage and features that may reduce demand for our database and adversely affect our revenue. we rely primarily on a combination of copyright laws, trade secrets, patents, database laws and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our database, software and related technology. we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our intellectual property from infringement, misappropriation or piracy will prove to be sufficient. current or potential competitors may use our intellectual property without our authorization in the development of databases, software or technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours, and even if we discover evidence of infringement, misappropriation or intellectual property piracy, our recourse against them may be limited or could require us to pursue litigation, which could involve substantial attorneys' fees, costs and expenses and diversion of management's attention from the operation of our business. our database is a compilation of public domain, licensed, otherwise-acquired and independently developed information obtained from various sources such as aerial photographs, commercially available maps and data, government records, other data sources and field observation. current or potential competitors may be able to use publicly available sources of information and techniques similar to ours to independently create a database containing substantially the same information as our database. any of these events likely would harm our competitive position. the laws of some countries in which we operate do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of other countries. for example, although our database and software are protected in part by copyright, database and trade secret rights, copyright protection does not extend to facts and legislative database protections that relate to compilations of facts currently exist only in certain countries of europe and do not exist in the united states or canada. in addition, as we continue to expand our geographic coverage outside of north america and europe, there may be little or no intellectual property protection and increased rates of piracy. further, we recently have begun to outsource some software development and data production functions to third parties located in foreign countries where we believe there is an increased risk of infringement, misappropriation and piracy and an increased possibility that we may not be able to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights. copies of our database that are distributed to end-users do not always include effective protection against unlawful copying. while we attempt to stop data piracy, our </th>

    <th>RISK FACTORS An investment in the Securities offered hereby involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information set forth in the Prospectus before purchasing the Securities offered hereby. GENERAL BUSINESS RISKS The Company's business is subject to various business risks, including economic risks. Economic conditions affect the overall level of mortgage business activity. The decisions to buy, sell or refinance residences are affected by such economic conditions as changes in overall growth of the economy, the level of consumer confidence, real estate values, prevailing interest rates and investment returns expected by the financial community. These conditions could affect the number and size of mortgage loans of the types originated and purchased by the Company and make these mortgage loans less attractive to borrowers or investors. In addition, a decline in real estate values will have an adverse effect on the loan-to-value ratios for the related mortgage loans, weakening the collateral coverage and resulting in greater exposure in the event of a default. This greater exposure to default could make it more difficult for the Company to obtain interim financing for mortgage loans it originates or purchases or decrease the availability of purchasers of such mortgage loans or interest expected by the purchasers. See "Business" and "---Liabilities Under Representations and Warranties." Mortgage companies often offset the effects of an economic downturn where the economic downturn is caused by higher interest rates by servicing mortgages. Such servicers receive from the owners of the mortgages up to one-half of one per cent of the outstanding mortgage loan balance per annum and consequently have a continuing revenue stream during periods when the volume of new originations slows. The Company sells the servicing rights of all of the mortgage loans it originates or purchases. Not servicing mortgage loans subjects the Company to reliance upon the generation or purchase of mortgage loans for revenues and, consequently, subjects the Company to changes in the economic cycle and the general economic health in the geographic area or areas in which it operates.DEPENDENCE UPON WHOLESALE BROKERS During the year ended December 31, 1997, purchased loans from brokers accounted for approximately 84% of the mortgage loans closed by the Company, while the Company's retail division originated the remainder, approximately 16% of such mortgage loans. None of these brokers are contractually obligated to do business with the Company. Further, the Company's competitors also have relationships with the Company's brokers and actively compete with the Company in its efforts to expand its broker relationships. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining its existing relationships or expanding its broker and correspondent network. If the Company is not successful in maintaining or expanding its broker network, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. See "Business - Loan Production."DEPENDENCE UPON FUNDING SOURCES The Company's ability to originate and purchase mortgage loans depends to a large extent upon its ability to fund mortgage loans upon acceptable terms on an interim basis. The Company funds substantially all of the mortgage loans it purchases and originates through borrowings under collateralized loan purchase agreements with several commercial banks and thrifts which provide primary credit facilities upon which the Company relies. These agreements are generally terminable at will by either party. The Company's borrowings are in turn repaid with proceeds received by the Company when such mortgage loans are sold. The Company has relied upon a few lenders to provide the primary credit facilities for its loan originations and purchases. Accordingly, any failure to renew or obtain adequate funding under the Company's financing facilities or other financing arrangements, or any substantial reduction in the size of or increase in the cost of such facilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent the Company is not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financing, it may have to curtail its mortgage loan origination and purchase activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business - Funding of Mortgage Loans." 6DEPENDENCE ON PROGRAMS THAT PURCHASE LOANS OR GUARANTEE LOANS Institutional investors, which purchase all of the mortgage loans originated by the Company, generate funds by selling mortgage-backed securities and are largely dependent upon the continuation of programs administered by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae, which provide the context and facilitate the issuance of such securities. Although the Company is not aware of any proposed actions, the discontinuation of, or a significant reduction in, the operation of such programs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. In addition, the mortgage loan products eligible for such programs may be changed from time to time by the sponsor. The profitability of specific types of mortgage loan products may vary depending on a number of factors, including the administrative costs to the Company of purchasing or originating such types of mortgage loans. See "Business - Mortgage Loan Sales."COMPETITION The Company faces strong competition in originating, purchasing and selling mortgage loans and the related mortgage servicing rights. The Company's competition is principally from savings and loans associations, other mortgage companies, commercial banks and, to a lesser degree, credit unions and insurance companies, depending upon the type of mortgage loan product offered. Many of these institutions have greater financial and other resources than the Company and maintain a significant number of branch offices in the area in which theCompany conducts operations. Increased competition for mortgage loans from other lenders may result in a decrease in the volume of mortgage loans originated and purchased by the Company If the Company is unable to compete effectively, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. See "Business - Competition."LIABILITIES UNDER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes representations and warranties to the purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans and the related mortgage servicing rights regarding compliance with laws, regulations and program standards. The Company generally receives similar representations and warranties from the brokers from whom it purchases mortgage loans. In the event of a breach of these representations and warranties, the Company may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans and/or may be liable for certain damages.However, in its twelve years of business, the Company has not been required to repurchase any mortgage loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience any such losses in the future. See "Business." INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS Changes in interest rates can have differing effects on various aspects of the Company's business, particularly in the areas of volume of mortgage loans originated and purchased, discussed above (See "Risk Factors -General Business Risks."), as well as net interest income and sales of mortgage loans. When the Company purchases or originates a loan, it usually has a commitment from a third party to purchase that loan. Generally, the Company funds the loan using borrowings from its lines of credit at commercial banks and thrifts known as warehouse lines of credit. The warehouse line of credit is repaid upon the sale of the warehoused loans. Before the Company sells the mortgage loan, it is entitled to receive interest income on the loan from the borrower and simultaneously pays interest expense to the institution providing the warehouse line of credit. The interest rate the Company receives during this period and the interest rate it pays are different. The profitability of the loan is affected by this difference and the fluctuations in interest rates before the mortgage loan is sold. Although the Company generally has a commitment to sell the mortgage loan before it commits to fund the mortgage loan, there are situations in which the Company does bear a risk in changing interest rates prior to the mortgage loan being sold. In particular, if the interest rates increase during the time before the Company sells the uncommitted mortgage loan but after it has funded the mortgage loan, the Company could sell the principal of the mortgage loan for less than the Company funded, thereby decreasing the mortgage loan's profitability or incurring a loss on the mortgage loan's sale. 7 To manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation between the time the mortgage loan is funded and sold, the Company engages in certain hedging activity by entering forward delivery contracts to sell mortgage-backed securities and forward delivery commitments for the sale of whole loans. Often the Company hedges more than 90% of the aggregate amount of the mortgage loans that have been warehoused or approved but not yet funded. Although this hedging activity is designed to reduce or eliminate risks related to interest rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that such hedging activity will be successful or that the Company will not incur significant losses in connection therewith. See "--- Sale of Mortgage Loan Servicing."INABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND MANAGE GROWTH Although the Company has experienced rapid and substantial growth in total revenues recently, there can be no assurance that the Company can sustain these rates of growth or that it will be able to continue to recruit and retain sufficient personnel to keep pace with a prolonged period of growth.SALE OF MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING The prices obtained by the Company upon the sale of mortgage loan servicing rights depend upon a number of factors, including the general supply of and demand for mortgage servicing rights, as well as prepayment and delinquency rates on the portfolios of mortgage servicing rights being sold.Interest rate changes can affect the profitability of the sale of mortgage loan servicing rights to a third party. Purchasers of mortgage loan servicing rights analyze a variety of factors to determine the purchase price they are willing to pay, including prepayment sensitivity of servicing rights. Because of the increased likelihood of prepayment in periods of declining interest rates, sales of mortgage loan servicing rights related to higher interest rate mortgage loans may be sold for less than in times of stable or increasing interest rates, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. See "Business - Mortgage Loan Sales."LEGISLATION AND REGULATION Federal, state and local authorities regulate and examine the origination, processing, underwriting, selling and servicing of mortgage loans. The Company is an approved seller/servicer of mortgage loans for Fannie Mae. In addition, the Company is an approved mortgagee by HUD. Among other consequences, the failure to comply with HUD or Fannie Mae regulations could prevent the Company from reselling its mortgage loans or prevent its ability to enter into the servicing of mortgage loans should it choose to do so. Such failure could also result in demands for indemnification or mortgage loan repurchase, certain rights of rescission for mortgage loans, class action law suits and administrative enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business results of operations and financial conditions. Federal, state and local governmental authorities also regulate theCompany's activities as a lender. The Truth in Lending Act ("TILA") and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder contain certain requirements designed to provide consumers with uniform, understandable information with respect to the terms and conditions of mortgage loans and credit transactions. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA") prohibits creditors from discriminating against applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age or marital status, among other restrictions and requirements. In instances where the applicant is denied credit, or the rate or charge for a mortgage loan increases as a result of information obtained from a consumer credit agency, the Fair Credit ReportingAct of 1970 requires the lender to supply the applicant with a name and address of the reporting agency. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Debt Collection Practices Act subject the Company to filing an annual report with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain compliance with these requirements in the future without additional expenses, or that more restrictive local, state or federal laws, rules and regulations will not be adopted or that existing laws and regulations will not be interpreted in a more restrictive manner, which would make compliance more difficult and more expensive for the Company.GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION All of the Company's mortgage loan originations and purchases for the year ended December 31, 1997, were derived from the San Francisco Bay area. The Company currently does no business outside the San Francisco Bay area and intends to continue its loan origination and purchases activity in the SanFrancisco Bay area. The Company is, however, studying business opportunities outside of the San Francisco Bay area, including other areas of California or Utah. There is no assurance that the Company will enter these or other markets or that if the Company does expand to new markets, it will generate sufficient revenues that exceed the costs associated with activities in such new markets or that the business activity in those new markets will match that achieved in theSan Francisco Bay area. Whether or not the Company enters into new geographic markets, the Company's results of operations and financial condition will be significantly affected by general trends in the economy of the San Francisco Bay area and its residential real estate market for the foreseeable future. 8 YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE The Company's computer systems may not comply with year 2000 issues.Over the next few years, the Company may incur additional expenditures to modify its software to operate correctly for the year 2000. While considered to be immaterial by management, the Company has not yet quantified such costs, which will be expensed as incurred. If the Company does not address this issue successfully, the Company's business could be materially and adversely affected.DEPENDENCE UPON KEY PERSONNEL The Company's business is substantially dependent on the efforts of Joseph Kristul, its Chief Executive Officer, and Maria Kristul, its President. Joseph Kristul and Maria Kristul are husband and wife. Both have executed employment agreements with the Company through December 31, 1999. Each may terminate the agreement for good reason in the event the executive has a reduction in title and/or compensation or the assignment of duties not consistent with those of a senior executive; the material breach by the Company of any provisions of the employment agreement; the relocation of the Company's principal executive offices to a location more than 25 miles from its present location; or a change in control of the Company, as defined. In defined circumstance the agreements provide for severance payments up to two times the executive's base salary. The Company has obtained key-man insurance in the face amount of $3,000,000 on the life of Mr. Kristul. There can be no assurance that amount will be sufficient to compensate the Company for the loss of Mr.Kristul's services. See "Management." ABSENCE OF PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET - AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock. The Company has applied to have the Common Stock listed on the American Stock Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Company's Common Stock will be approved for listing or if approved that the Company will be able to maintain the criteria for listing. Such listing, if granted, does not imply that a meaningful, sustained market for the Common Stock will develop. If a meaningful market does not develop or if the Company is not listed on the American StockExchange, holders of Common Stock may be unable to sell Common Stock or may be able to sell only at significantly lower prices than the original offering price. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the Common Stock offered hereby will develop or, if it should develop, will continue nor can there be any assurance that the Common Stock may be sold at its original offering price or at any other price. From time to time after this offering, there also may be significant volatility in the market price for the CommonStock. ARBITRARY DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The public offering price for the Common Stock offered hereby was determined by negotiation between the Company and the Representative. The factors considered in determining the public offering price include the Company's revenue growth since its organization, the industry in which it operates, the Company's business potential and earning prospects and the general condition of the securities markets at the time of the offering. Prices for the shares of Common Stock after this offering will be determined in the market and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity of the market for the Common Stock, investor perception of the Company and the mortgage banking industry as a whole. See "Underwriting."IMMEDIATE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION The Company's current shareholders acquired their shares of Common Stock at a cost substantially below the price at which such shares are being offered in this offering. Consequently, investors purchasing the shares of Common Stock offered hereby will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of their investment. See "Dilution."INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS The Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that the liability of directors of the Company for monetary damages is eliminated to the fullest extent permitted under California law. The Company's Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify its directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding arising by reason of such person being or having been a director or officer to the fullest extent permitted underCalifornia law. Therefore, while the directors and officers may be accountable to the Company and its shareholders as fiduciaries, the Company and its shareholders have a more limited right of action than they would, absent the indemnification and limitation of liability provisions contained in the Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. 9 If available at reasonable cost, the Company intends to maintain insurance against any liability incurred by its officers and directors in defense of any actions to which they are made parties by reason of their positions as officers and directors. The Company does not presently have such insurance. The provisions of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation andBylaws and the Company's intent to obtain insurance on behalf of its officers and directors may reduce the likelihood of litigation against directors and may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty. See "Management Indemnification and Limitation on Liability." ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN CORPORATE CHARTER The Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company authorize the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval and subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Board of Directors which may have the effect of deterring a non-negotiated attempt to acquire control of the Company. There are currently no shares of preferred stock outstanding. A series of preferred stock could be issued in the future, for example, to thwart a possible take-over and may, in any event, operate to the significant disadvantage of the holders of Common Stock by including convertibility features which are lower than the market price for the CommonStock, which would dilute the value of existing shareholdings, including the shares of Common Stock issued in this offering. See "Description of Capital Stock - Preferred Stock." PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS Although the Company has paid dividends in the past as an S corporation, the Company's Board of Directors presently intends to retain all of the Company's earnings for the expansion of its business. The Company therefore does not anticipate the distribution of cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future decision of the Company's Board of Directors to pay cash dividends will depend, among other factors, upon the Company's earnings, financial position, and cash requirements. See "Dividend Policy."SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Upon completion of this offering, the Company's current shareholders will own 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock, which will represent 67.6% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (62.7% if the over-allotment option is exercised in full). Of such restricted shares of Common Stock, 2,468,750 have been held for more than one year and will be eligible for resale under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SecuritiesAct"), subject to volume and other limitations, beginning 90 days after the date of this Prospectus. All of such shares are held by an affiliate of the Company, the Kristul Family LLC. Another 31,250 shares will be eligible for sale on May 1, 1999, and the Company has granted options to purchase a total of 45,000 shares effective upon the completion of this offering. All existing shareholders of the Company have agreed not to sell, offer, contract to sell, or enter into any swap or similar agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic risk of ownership of the Common Stock, or otherwise dispose of any of their shares of Common Stock for a period of one year following the completion of this offering. The Company has also agreed to grant to theRepresentative warrants to acquire 120,000 shares of Common Stock. These shares have certain demand and piggyback registration rights. Sales of significant amounts of Common Stock by current shareholders in the public market after this offering or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. See "---Shares Eligible for FutureSale,""--- Effect of Representative's Warrants, "Principal and Selling Shareholders." and "Description of Capital Stock." CONTROL OF THE COMPANY The Kristul Family LLC, of which Joseph and Maria Kristul are managing members, will continue to own 66.7% of the Common Stock of the Company (61.9% if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). Accordingly, they will be in a position to elect the Company's directors and officers, to control the policies and operations of the Company and to determine the outcome of corporate transactions or other matters submitted for shareholder approval, including mergers, consolidations, the sale of the Company's assets or a change in control of the Company. See "Principal and Selling Shareholder." 10BENEFITS TO CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS The Kristul Family LLC has pledged all of the stock owned by it in connection with certain borrowings of the Company and Joseph and Maria Kristul have personally guaranteed that debt as well as other debt of the Company. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions." This offering will benefit the Kristul Family LLC and Joseph and Maria Kristul because the proceeds of this offering will be used to repay the debt for which the stock is pledged resulting in the release of the stock pledge and the related personal guarantees. The existing warehouse lines are also personally guaranteed by Joseph and MariaKristul. Upon completion of this offering, the Company will seek to enter into new warehouse lines without such personal guarantees. In addition, the Kristul Family LLC will receive proceeds from the sale of the shares, if any, sold in connection with an exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment option. EFFECT OF REPRESENTATIVE'S WARRANTS. Until the date five years following the date of this Prospectus, the holders of the Representative's Warrants are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the Common Stock, with a resulting dilution in the interests of the other shareholders. The shares of Common Stock underlying theRepresentative's Warrants have certain registration rights. Further, the terms on which the Company might obtain additional financing during that period may be adversely affected by the existence of the Representative's Warrants. The holders of the Representative's Warrants may exercise the Representative's Warrants at a time when the Company might be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided herein. The Company has agreed that, under certain circumstances, it will register under federal and state securities laws the Representative's Warrants and/or the securities issuable thereunder. Exercise of these registration rights could involve substantial expense to the Company at a time when it could not afford such expenditures and may adversely affect the terms upon which theCompany may obtain financing. See "Description of Capital Stock" and "Underwriting." REPRESENTATIVE'S INFLUENCE ON THE MARKET A significant amount of the shares of Common Stock offered hereby may be sold to customers of the Representative. Such customers subsequently may engage in transactions for the sale or purchase of such Common Stock through or with the Representative. Although they have no obligation to do so, theRepresentative may otherwise effect transactions in such securities. Such market making activity may be discontinued at any time. If they participate in the market, the Representative may exert a dominating influence on the market, if one develops, for the Common Stock described in this Prospectus. The price and the liquidity of the Common Stock may be significantly affected by the degree, if any, of the Representative's participation in such market. 11</th>

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS The following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this Prospectus before purchasing the Common Stock offered by this Prospectus. Except for the historical information contained herein, the discussion contained in this Prospectus contains "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this Prospectus. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere herein.Competitive Market for Experienced Scientists. The Company's future success will depend to a significant extent on its ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled chemists and other scientists. The Company's ability to maintain, expand or renew existing engagements with its customers, enter into new engagements and provide additional services to its existing customers depends, in large part, on its ability to hire and retain scientists with the skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in drug discovery and development technologies. The Company believes that there is a shortage of, and significant competition for, scientists with the skills and experience in chemistry necessary to perform the services offered by the Company. The Company competes with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, combinatorial chemistry companies, contract research companies and research and academic institutions for new personnel. The inability to hire additional qualified personnel may materially adversely affect the Company's future growth. In addition, the Company's inability to hire additional qualified scientists may require an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new personnel. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in attracting, retaining or motivating its scientific personnel. Failure to attract, retain or motivate such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Business--Competition."Dependence on Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Industries and Clients; Risk of Cost Overruns. The Company has benefitted to date from the increasing trend of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource chemical research and development projects. A reversal or slowing of this trend could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company's contract revenues are highly dependent on research and development expenditures by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The Company's operations could be materially adversely affected by general economic downturns in its clients' industries, the impact of the current trend toward consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry or any decrease in research and development expenditures. In addition, historically, a substantial portion of the Company's revenue has been derived from contracts with a limited number of significant customers. For the year ended December 31, 1997, net contract revenue from the Company's three largest customers represented approximately 29%, 11% and 9% of total net contract revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 1998, net contract revenue from the Company's three largest customers represented approximately 18%, 17% and 15% of total net contract revenue, respectively. The Company's contracts generally are terminable upon 30, 60 or 90 days' notice by the customer. The Company's contracts may be terminated for a number of reasons, many of which may be beyond the Company's control, such as reduction or reallocation of a customer's research and development budget or change in a customer's overall financial condition. The loss of a large contract or multiple smaller contracts, or a significant decrease in revenue derived from such contracts, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of the Company's contracts for the provision of its services have a fixed price or are subject to a maximum fee. As a result, the Company bears the risk of cost overruns with respect to such contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to perform its obligations with respect to any such contracts within the prescribed fixed fees or applicable maximum fees. Significant cost overruns with respect to such contracts could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Business--Current Collaborations; Customers."Risks Related to the Allegra/Telfast Royalty. Under the terms of a license agreement, the Company has granted HMRI, formerly Marion Merrell Dow Inc., an exclusive, worldwide license in exchange for milestones and royalties to use the Company's patents relating to fexofenadine HCl, which is the active ingredient in a new, non-sedating antihistamine marketed and sold by HMRI as a prescription medicine. Fexofenadine HCl is 7 marketed under the brand name Allegra in the Americas and under the brand name Telfast elsewhere. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company's milestones and royalties from fexofenadine HCl were $2.5 million, or 23.8% of the Company's aggregate net contract revenue plus other operating revenue, and for the nine months ended September 30, 1998, the Company's milestones and royalties from fexofenadine HCl were $15.6 million, or 60.4% of the Company's aggregate net contract revenue plus other operating revenue. The Company's milestones and royalties from fexofenadine HCl for the nine months ended September 30, 1998 include $3.0 million in non-recurring milestone payments and $4.4 million in royalties related to prior periods and as a result such milestone payments and royalties may not be indicative of future amounts earned under the license agreement with HMRI. In particular, no further milestone payments are required under the agreement. The Company does not participate in the manufacturing, marketing or sale of fexofenadine HCl by HMRI and relies entirely on the efforts of HMRI to manufacture, market and sell this product. There can be no assurance that HMRI will continue to be successful in marketing and selling fexofenadine HCl, that fexofenadine HCl will continue to receive market acceptance or that the Company will continue to receive significant royalties from HMRI in accordance with the license agreement. In addition, there can be no assurance that a comparable or superior antihistamine to fexofenadine HCl will not be developed or that fexofenadine HCl will not be found to have unintended side effects which could cause the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") or other government regulatory authorities to require that HMRI withdraw fexofenadine HCl from the market in the U.S. or other countries or could adversely affect market acceptance of fexofenadine HCl. The failure of fexofenadine HCl to be marketed successfully, to continue to receive market acceptance or to generate significant royalties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event any of the Company's patents relating to fexofenadine HCl are subjected to successful challenge, royalties under the license agreement would be materially and adversely affected. See "--Proprietary Technology; Unpredictability of Patent Protection" and "Business--Allegra/Telfast Royalty and Licensing Agreement."Proprietary Technology; Unpredictability of Patent Protection. The Company's success will depend, in part, on its ability to obtain and enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties when necessary, and conduct its business without infringing the proprietary rights of others. The patent positions of pharmaceutical, medical products and biotechnology firms can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. There can be no assurance that any patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage, or will not be circumvented by others. In the event a third party has also filed one or more patent applications for inventions which conflict with those of the Company, the Company may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "PTO") to determine priority of invention, which could result in the loss of any opportunity to secure patent protection for the inventions and the loss of any right to use the inventions. Even if the eventual outcome is favorable to the Company, such proceedings could result in substantial cost to the Company. The filing and prosecution of patent applications, litigation to establish the validity and scope of patents, assertion of patent infringement claims against others and the defense of patent infringement claims by others can be expensive and time consuming. There can be no assurance that in the event that any claims with respect to any of the Company's patents, if issued, are challenged by one or more third parties, that any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will determine that such patent claims are valid and enforceable. An adverse outcome in such litigation could cause the Company to lose exclusivity afforded by the disputed rights. If a third party is found to have rights covering products or processes used by the Company, the Company could be forced to cease using the technologies covered by such rights, could be subject to significant liability to such third party, and could be required to license technologies from such third party. Furthermore, even if the Company's patents are determined to be valid, enforceable, and broad in scope, there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with the Company and its licensees using the resulting alternative technology. See "Business--Patents and Proprietary Rights."Management of Growth and Expansion. The Company's operations have grown rapidly and substantially in recent years. Such growth has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on the Company's operational, human and financial resources. The Company's ability to compete effectively will depend, in large part, upon its ability to hire, train and assimilate additional management, professional, scientific and technical 8 operating personnel and its ability to expand, improve and effectively utilize its operating, management, marketing and financial systems to accommodate its expanded operations. The physical expansion of the Company's facilities to accommodate future growth may lead to significant costs and divert management and business development resources. The failure by the Company's management to effectively anticipate, implement and manage the changes required to sustain the Company's growth may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.Dependence on Key Personnel. The Company's performance is highly dependent on the principal members of its senior management and scientific staff, including, in particular, Dr. Thomas E. D'Ambra, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Donald E. Kuhla, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Harold Meckler, the Company's Vice President, Chemical Development, and Dr. Michael P. Trova, the Company's Vice President, Medicinal Chemistry. Moreover, the responsibilities of the Company's senior management and scientific staff have recently increased since the departure in October 1998 of the Company's chief financial officer. The Company is actively seeking to hire a permanent chief financial officer. Although the Company has entered into agreements containing non-competition restrictions with its senior scientific and management personnel and into employment agreements with Drs. D'Ambra, Kuhla, Meckler and Trova, the Company does not have employment agreements with all of its key personnel. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to retain such personnel or attract and retain a new chief financial officer on a timely basis. The Company maintains key person life insurance on Dr. D'Ambra. The loss of one or more members of the Company's senior management or scientific staff, or the Company's inability to hire a permanent chief financial officer on a timely basis, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Business--Employees," "Management--Executive Officers, Directors and Key Employees" and "Certain Transactions."Competition. The Company faces competition based on a number of factors, including size, relative expertise and sophistication, speed and costs of identifying and optimizing potential lead compounds and of developing and optimizing chemical processes. The Company competes with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, combinatorial chemistry companies, contract research companies and research and academic institutions. Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources and more experience in research and development than the Company. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through arrangements with large corporate collaborators.Historically, pharmaceutical companies have maintained close control over their research and development activities, including the synthesis, screening and optimization of chemical compounds and the development of chemical processes. Many of these companies, which represent a significant potential market for the Company's products and services, are developing or already possess in-house technologies and services offered by the Company. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations are also conducting research in areas in which the Company provides services either independently or through collaborative efforts.The Company anticipates that it will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and advanced technologies become available. The Company's services and expertise may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or novel approaches developed by one or more of the Company's competitors. The existing approaches of the Company's competitors or new approaches or technologies developed by the Company's competitors may be more effective than those developed by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company's competitors will not develop more effective or more affordable technologies or services, thus rendering the Company's technologies and/or services obsolete, uncompetitive or uneconomical. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully with existing or potential competitors or that competitive factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. See "Business-- Competition."Variation in Quarterly Operating Results; Seasonality. The Company's results of operations historically have fluctuated on a quarterly basis and can be expected to continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Quarterly operating results can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the commencement, delay, cancellation or completion of contracts; risks associated with fixed price contracts; the mix of services provided; seasonal slowdowns; the timing of start-up expenses for new services and facilities; and the timing and 9 integration of acquisitions. In particular, quarterly fluctuations in the Company's royalty revenue relating to fexofenadine HCl, an anti-histamine subject to seasonal demand, may produce stronger fluctuations in the Company's results of operations than those which have occurred over prior periods. The Company believes that quarterly comparison of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. In addition, fluctuations in quarterly results could affect the market price of the Common Stock in a manner unrelated to the longer term operating performance of the Company. See "--Absence of a Public Trading Market; Offering Price; Possible Volatility of Future Stock Price" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Quarterly Results of Operations."Limited Marketing Experience; Expansion of Sales Activities. To date, the Company has sold its services and products primarily through the efforts of the Company's senior management. The Company anticipates that it will need to retain additional sales and marketing personnel and expand its sales and marketing activities in order to achieve significant long-term growth. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to build and maintain an efficient and effective sales and marketing organization or that such an organization will be successful in attracting new customers. The failure to build a successful sales organization could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.Potential Liability and Risks of Operations. The Company develops, tests and, to a very limited extent, manufactures pharmaceutical products intended for use in humans. Such activities could expose the Company to the risk of liability for personal injury or death to persons using such products, although the Company does not manufacture in bulk, market or sell such products. No assurance can be given that the Company will not be required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any such claim. The Company currently maintains product liability insurance with respect to these risks. No assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate or can be maintained at acceptable costs or at all. The failure of such insurance policies to protect the Company from such claims or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.All facilities and manufacturing techniques used in the manufacture of products for clinical use or for sale in the United States must be operated in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") guidelines as established by the FDA. The Company's facilities are subject to scheduled periodic regulatory inspections to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements. Failure on the part of the Company to comply with applicable requirements could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities. A finding that the Company had materially violated cGMP requirements could result in additional regulatory sanctions and, in severe cases, could result in a mandated closing of the Company's facilities which would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.Risk of Interruption of Operations. The Company's results of operations are dependent upon the continued use of its highly specialized laboratories and equipment. The Company's operations are primarily concentrated in a single facility in Albany, New York. Although the Company has contingency plans in effect for certain natural disasters, as well as other unforeseen events which could damage the Company's laboratories or equipment, no assurance can be given that any such events will not materially interrupt the Company's business. The Company maintains business interruption insurance to cover lost revenues caused by such occurrences. However, such insurance would not compensate the Company for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with existing customers created by an inability to complete its customer contracts in a timely manner.Risks Associated with Acquisitions. The Company from time to time reviews potential acquisition candidates in the ordinary course of its business. No assurance can be given that acquisition candidates will be available or will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including among others, difficulties and expenses incurred in connection with the consummation of such acquisitions by the Company and the subsequent assimilation of the operations, personnel and services or products of the acquired companies, the difficulty of operating new businesses, the diversion of management's 10 attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company. Acquisitions of foreign companies may also involve the additional risks of assimilating differences in business practices and overcoming language barriers. To date, the Company has grown entirely through internal expansion, and there can be no assurance that any acquisition will be identified or completed or, if completed, will be successfully integrated into the Company's operations. The Company presently has no agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisition.Broad Management Discretion in Use of Proceeds. The principal purposes of the offering are to increase the Company's equity capital, to create a public market for the Company's Common Stock, to increase the visibility of the Company in the marketplace and to facilitate future access by the Company to public equity markets. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of its indebtedness, for additional capital expenditures and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Company has not, however, identified specific uses for a significant portion of the net proceeds of the offering. Accordingly, the Company's management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering. Although the Company has no plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions as of the date of this Prospectus, the Company may seek acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies that are complementary to those of the Company, and a portion of the net proceeds may be used for such acquisitions. See "Use of Proceeds."Potential Adverse Impact of Pharmaceutical and Health Care Reform. The Company expects that a substantial portion of its contract revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived from services provided to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Accordingly, the Company's future success is directly dependent upon the success of the companies within those industries and their continued demand for the Company's services. The levels of revenues and profitability of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means and the initiatives of third party payors with respect to the availability of reimbursement. For example, in certain foreign markets pricing or profitability of pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the United States, there have been, and the Company expects that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government control. It is uncertain what legislative proposals may be adopted or what actions federal, state or private third party payors for health care goods or services may take in response to any health care reform proposals or legislation. To the extent that such proposals or reforms have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations and profitability of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actual or prospective customers for the Company's services and products, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Potential Liability Regarding Hazardous Materials. The research and development processes of the Company involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, the Company could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could exceed the resources of the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations related to the handling or disposal of such materials or waste products in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.Effective Control by Principal Stockholders. After giving effect to the sale of the shares of Common Stock offered hereby, Thomas E. D'Ambra, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Chester J. Opalka, the Company's Vice President, Senior Research Chemist and a Director, will beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 51.8% (50.3% assuming exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment option in full) of the outstanding Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exert significant influence over the outcome of fundamental corporate transactions requiring stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, mergers and sales of assets and the election of the members of the Company's Board of Directors. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. See "Principal Stockholders" and "Shares Eligible for Future Sale." 11Shares Eligible for Future Sale. Sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market after this offering could adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. In addition to the 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock offered hereby, up to approximately 9,979,561 shares of Common Stock owned by current stockholders of the Company will be eligible for sale in the public market pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), at various times beginning 90 days after the date of this Prospectus. Executive officers, directors and stockholders of the Company who in the aggregate hold 9,954,999 shares of Common Stock and options to purchase 1,861,101 shares of Common Stock have agreed, pursuant to certain Lock-up Agreements (the "Lock-up Agreements"), that until 180 days after the date of this Prospectus, they will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, assign, transfer, encumber, contract to sell, grant an option to purchase, make a distribution of, or otherwise dispose of, any shares of Common Stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, otherwise than (i) as a bona fide gift or gifts, provided that the donee or donees thereof agree in writing as a condition precedent to such gift or gifts to be bound by the terms of the Lock-up Agreements, or (ii) with the prior written consent of ING Baring Furman Selz LLC. Sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock (including shares issued in connection with future acquisitions which may be issued with registration rights), or the availability of such shares for sale, may adversely affect the prevailing market price for the Common Stock and could impair the Company's ability to obtain additional capital through an offering of its equity securities. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale."Absence of a Public Trading Market; Offering Price; Possible Volatility of Future Stock Price. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock, and there can be no assurance that an active market will develop or be sustained following the consummation of this offering. Consequently, the offering price of the Common Stock will be determined by negotiation between the Company and the representatives of the several Underwriters based on several factors and will not necessarily reflect the market price of the Common Stock after this offering or the price at which the Common Stock may be sold in the public market after this offering. See "Underwriting" for a description of the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price. Following the completion of this offering, the trading price of the Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in the Company's operating results, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, material announcements by the Company or its competitors, governmental regulatory action, or other events or factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected market prices of smaller capitalization companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. In addition, the Company's operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In such event, the price of the Common Stock would likely decline, perhaps substantially. See "Underwriting."Computer Systems and Year 2000 Issues. The "Year 2000" issue concerns the potential exposures related to the automated generation of business and financial misinformation resulting from the application of computer programs which have been written using two digits, rather than four, to define the application year of business transactions. The Company's independent information technology consultant has conducted a comprehensive assessment of the Company's computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the Year 2000, and has determined that no material changes are required for the Company's computer systems to be Year 2000 compliant. As such, the Company believes that, based upon currently available information, it will incur no material costs associated with becoming Year 2000 compliant. The Company is seeking to confirm the Year 2000 readiness of its material customers (such as Astra AB and Eli Lilly and Company), its key licensees (such as HMRI) and its material vendors. Failure of the Company, its software providers or the Company's customers or vendors to adequately address the Year 2000 issue could result in misstatement of reported financial information or otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.Dividend Policy. The Company has not declared cash dividends on its Common Stock since its inception and the Company does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Under Delaware law, the Company is permitted to pay dividends only out of its surplus, or, if there is no surplus, out of its net profits. Although the Company's current credit facility permits the Company to pay cash dividends, 12 the payment of cash dividends may be prohibited under agreements governing debt which the Company may incur in the future. See "Dividend Policy" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."Anti-takeover Provisions. Certain provisions of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate") and Amended and Restated By- laws (the "By-laws"), certain sections of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to establish the voting rights, preferences and other terms thereof, may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may discourage takeover attempts not first approved by the Board of Directors (including takeovers which stockholders may deem to be in their best interests). Such provisions include, among other things, a classified Board of Directors serving staggered three-year terms, the elimination of stockholder voting by written consent, the removal of directors only for cause, the vesting of exclusive authority in the Board of Directors to determine the size of the Board of Directors and (subject to certain limited exceptions) to fill vacancies thereon, the vesting of exclusive authority in the Board of Directors (except as otherwise required by law) to call special meetings of stockholders, and certain ad</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and all other information contained in this prospectus before you decide to invest in our common stock. if any of the following risk factors, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. risks related to our businesswe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and if we are unable to maintain these customer relationships or attract additional customers, our revenue will be adversely affected. for the years ended december31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, revenue from bmw ag and harman international industries,inc., our top two customers, accounted for approximately 30%, 28% and 29%, respectively, of our total revenue. in addition, during those three years, sales to our top 15 customers accounted for approximately 80%, 75% and 75% of our revenue, respectively. for the quarter ended march28, 2004, revenue from our top two customers accounted for approximately 29% of our total revenue and sales to our top 15customers accounted for approximately 75% of our revenue. although we have achieved some success in expanding our customer base, we anticipate that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future. in addition, although we have contractual arrangements with most of our key customers, the majority of these arrangements are not long term and generally do not obligate our key customers to make any minimum or specified level of purchases. therefore, our relationships with these key customers may or may not continue in the future, and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of revenue from them. we cannot assure you that our revenue from our current customers will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. the loss of one or more of our key customers, or fewer or smaller orders from them, would adversely affect our revenue.we have historically incurred operating losses and we may not achieve sustained profitability. prior to the year ended december31, 2002, we had been unprofitable on an annual basis since our inception. for the years ended december31, 2000 and 2001, we had operating losses of $51.3million and $28.9million, respectively, and net losses of $109.6million and $116.5million, respectively. as of march28, 2004, we had an accumulated deficit of $512.1million. although we have achieved an operating profit and a net profit in each of the last two fiscal years, we cannot assure you that our revenue will continue to grow at its current rate or that we will be able to maintain profitability in the future.the market for products and services incorporating our map database is evolving and its rate of growth is uncertain. our success depends upon our customers' abilities to successfully market and sell their products incorporating our database. continued growth in the adoption of route guidance products in the automotive industry and in the consumer mobile devices industry (in products such as personal digital assistants, wireless telephones, personal navigation devices and laptop computers), additional technological improvements in wireless devices, such as inclusion of gps capabilities in mobile devices and increases in functional memory, and continued development by our current and potential customers of dynamic navigation, route planning, location-based information, asset tracking and other geographic-related products and services incorporating our database, are critical to our future growth. if our customers do not continue to successfully develop and market new products and services incorporating our database, or the products that our customers develop and market do not meet consumer expectations, our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected. growth in the market for vehicle navigation products and services historically has occurred first in europe and then in north america. if the market growth in north america is not consistent with the growth we have experienced in europe, our ability to grow our revenue will be adversely affected.our product offering is not diversified and if we attempt to diversify, we may not be successful. our map database is our principal product, and a substantial majority of our revenue is attributable to the licensing of our database for route guidance applications. consequently, if the market for existing and new products and services incorporating our database declines or does not continue to grow, our business would be seriously harmed because we currently do not have additional products or services that would generate sufficient revenue to enable us to sustain our business while seeking new markets and applications for our database. in addition, any attempt by us to diversify our product and service offerings may not be successful and may cause us to divert resources and management attention away from our core business, which could adversely affect our financial position, reputation and relationships with our customers.if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our profitability and ability to implement our strategy will be adversely affected. our continued growth has and will continue to place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. to accommodate this growth and successfully execute our strategy, we will need to continue to hire additional qualified personnel and implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems and internal operating and financial controls and procedures throughout our company. our inability to expand and integrate these additions and upgrades in an efficient and timely manner could cause our expenses to increase, revenue to decline and could otherwise adversely affect our profitability and ability to implement our strategy.we derive the majority of our revenue from the use of our map database in vehicle navigation systems and fluctuations in the condition of the automotive market may result in fluctuations in the demand for products incorporating our database. the use of our database in vehicle navigation systems, which we supply directly and indirectly to automobile manufacturers, historically has accounted for a substantial majority of our revenue. approximately 82%, 82% and 83% of our revenue for the years ended december31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, and approximately 85% of our revenue for the quarter ended march28, 2004, were generated by the sale of our database for use in new automobiles equipped with navigation systems. any significant downturn in the demand for these products would materially decrease our revenue. the automotive market historically has experienced fluctuations due to increased competition, economic conditions and circumstances affecting the global market for automobiles generally, and additional fluctuations are likely to occur in the future. to the extent that our future revenue depends materially on sales of new automobiles equipped with navigation systems enabled by digital maps, our business may be vulnerable to these fluctuations.our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our license fees. our profitability depends significantly on the prices we are able to charge customers for our data and other services. the license fees we charge our customers are affected by a number of factors, including: our customers' perception of the quality of our data and other products and services; the proliferation of navigation applications in lower-cost products and services and market acceptance of those products and services; our customers' expectations of lower license fees as a result of economies of scale, customer-imposed efficiency improvements and decreases in prices of hardware and software incorporating our database; competition; advances in technology that reduce the cost of geographic data acquisition; introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors; pricing policies of our competitors; price sensitivity of end-users of navigation products and services; and general economic conditions. any one or a combination of these factors could cause a decline in our license fees and thus, adversely affect our revenue and profitability. in addition, the success of our pricing policies is based, in part, on our assessment of the evolution of the market for products and services incorporating navigation applications, which is uncertain, and our ability to correlate the price we charge for various uses of our database. if either our assessment of the market evolution or our price correlations turn out to be incorrect, then our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected. the automotive market and the market for mobile devices are highly competitive and manufacturers in these markets are continually looking for ways to reduce the costs of components included in their products in order to maintain or broaden consumer acceptance of those products. because our map database is a component incorporated in automotive, wireless telephone and handheld navigational systems, we face pressure, from time to time, from our customers to lower our database license fees. we have in the past, and may in the future, need to lower our license fees to preserve customer relationships or extend use of our database to a broader range of products. to the extent we lower our license fees in the future, we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve related increases in the use of our database or other benefits to offset fully the effects of these adjustments. in addition, increased competition has affected our ability to maintain the level of our prices. if price adjustments resulting from increased competition are not offset by increases in sales of our database, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins or loss of market share by us. the market for map information is highly competitive. we compete with other companies and governmental and quasi-governmental agencies that provide map information to a wide variety of users in a wide range of applications with varying levels of functionality. we currently have several major competitors in providing map information, including teleatlas n.v., geographic data technology, inc. (gdt) and numerous european governmental and quasi-governmental mapping agencies (e.g., ordnance survey in the united kingdom) that license map data for commercial use. teleatlas offers detailed map data for western europe. in addition, gdt and teleatlas are now offering more detailed map data for the united states than previously had been available from those companies, which enhances their ability to compete with us in the united states market. in july 2004, teleatlas acquired gdt and, as a result, it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively with the combined company. governmental and quasi-governmental agencies also are making more map data information available free of charge or at lower prices, which may encourage new market entrants or reduce the demand for fee-based products and services which incorporate our map database. in addition, some of our customers prefer to license data from several vendors in order to diversify their sources of supply and to maintain competitive and pricing pressures. increased competition from our current competitors or new market entrants (which may include our customers), actions taken by our customers to diversify their sources of supply and increase pricing pressure, the acquisition of gdt by teleatlas and other competitive pressures, may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins or loss of market share by us.our dependence on our vehicle navigation systems manufacturer customers for compilation services could result in a material decrease in our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business. for vehicle navigation systems, we rely on our vehicle navigation systems manufacturer customers to compile copies of our map database into their proprietary formats. this can be a time and labor intensive and complex process. in some cases, these customers also are responsible for distributing the compiled database to the automobile manufacturers. if these customers do not compile or distribute our map database in a timely manner and consistent with the requirements of the automobile manufacturers, our reputation and relationships with the automobile manufacturers could be adversely affected. in other cases, our navigation systems manufacturer customers compile our map database and then return a master copy to us. we then distribute copies of the database to the automobile manufacturers in exchange for a distribution fee. if these customers do not fulfill their obligations to us to compile our map database, or to the extent we have not entered into agreements clearly specifying their obligations or fail to do so in the future, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to automobile manufacturers, which could result in our contractual liability to these automobile manufacturers, and would likely decrease our revenue and adversely affect our business. our vehicle navigation systems manufacturer customers also could decide to not provide compilation services to us, which would prevent us from providing distribution services to the automobile manufacturers with respect to these customers' navigation systems, and would result in a material decrease in our revenue.we derive a significant portion of our revenue from our international operations and economic, political and other inherent risks of international operations may adversely affect our financial performance. we have approximately 110 field and administrative offices in 19 countries worldwide. we have substantial operations in europe. approximately 64%, 68% and 66% of our total revenue in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, and approximately 69% of our total revenue during the quarter ended march28, 2004 were attributable to our european operations. we expect a significant portion of our revenue and expenses will be generated by our european operations in the future. accordingly, our operating results are and will continue to be subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we also collect data in various foreign jurisdictions and outsource some software development and data production functions in foreign jurisdictions. the key risks to us of operating in foreign countries include: reduced or inadequate intellectual property protections and/or high rates of intellectual property piracy in some jurisdictions; multiple, conflicting, vague and changing laws and regulations, including tax laws, employment laws, governmental approvals, permits and licenses; restrictions on the movement of cash; general political and economic instability; restrictions on the import and export of technologies; price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies; trade barriers, including tariffs and other laws and practices that favor local companies; maintenance of quality standards for outsourced work; and difficulties and costs in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations, including cultural differences. we expect to continue to expand internationally into other countries and regions, including into emerging economies, where we believe that many of these risks are increased.currency translation risk and currency transaction risk may adversely affect our results of operations. material portions of our revenue and expenses have been generated by our european operations, and we expect that our european operations will account for a material portion of our revenue and expenses in the future. substantially all of our international expenses and revenue are denominated in foreign currencies, principally, the euro. as a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in europe and other foreign markets in which we have operations. accordingly, fluctuations in the value of those currencies in relation to the u.s. dollar have caused and will continue to cause dollar-translated amounts to vary from one period to another. in addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency in which it receives revenue and pays expenses. historically, we had not engaged in activities to hedge our foreign currency exposures. on april22, 2003, we entered into a foreign currency derivative instrument to hedge certain foreign currency exposures related to intercompany transactions. for the year ended december31, 2003 and the quarter ended march28, 2004, we generated approximately 66% and 69% of our total revenue, respectively, and incurred approximately 45% and 50% of our total costs, respectively, in foreign currencies. our european operations reported revenue of $181million and $55million for the year ended december31, 2003 and for the quarter ended march28, 2004, respectively. for the year ended december31, 2003, approximately $28million (or approximately 10%) of our revenue was a result of an increase in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, as compared to 2002, with every $0.01 change in the exchange ratio of the euro against the dollar resulting in a $1.6million change in our revenue and a $0.8million change in our operating income. for the quarter ended march28, 2004, approximately $6million (or approximately 7%) of our revenue was a result of an increase in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, as compared to the same period in 2003, with every $0.01 change in the exchange ratio of the euro against the dollar resulting in a $0.4million change in our revenue and a $0.2million change in our operating income. our analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the united states or europe. given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency translation and/or transaction risks, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.we are subject to income taxes in many countries because of our international operations and we exercise judgment in order to determine our provision for income taxes. because that determination is an estimate, we cannot be certain that our income tax provisions and accruals will be adequate. we are subject to income taxes in many countries, jurisdictions and provinces. our international operations require us to exercise judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes. regularly, we make estimates where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. while we believe our estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audit or tax-related litigation will not be materially different from that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the assessment of additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of audits, litigation or otherwise, could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition. we may not generate sufficient future taxable income to allow us to realize our deferred tax assets. we have a significant amount of tax loss carryforwards and interest expense carryforwards that will be available to reduce the taxes we would otherwise owe in the future. we have recognized the value of a portion of these future tax deductions in our consolidated balance sheet at march28, 2004. the realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income during the periods in which we are permitted, by law, to use those assets. we exercise judgment in evaluating our ability to realize the recorded value of these assets, and consider a variety of factors, including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. our evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets must consider both positive and negative evidence, and the weight given to the potential effects of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to which the evidence can be verified objectively. while we believe that sufficient positive evidence exists to support our determination that the realization of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not, we cannot assure you that we will have profitable operations in the future that will allow us to fully realize those assets.increased governmental regulation may place additional burdens on our business and adversely affect our ability to compete. although we do not believe governmental regulation has had a material effect on our business and operations to date, it is possible that we will experience the effects of increased regulation in the future. in the united states and europe, the combination of heightened security concerns and the increase in the breadth and accuracy of our map database could result in more restrictive laws and regulations, such as export control laws, applicable to our database. in addition, automobile safety initiatives may result in restrictions on devices that use our database. as we continue to expand our geographic coverage, policies favoring local companies and other regulatory initiatives may result in export control laws and other restrictions on our ability to access, collect and use map data or otherwise conduct business in various countries throughout the world. our failure to comply with local policies and regulations could result in a number of adverse consequences, including loss of access to map data, restrictions or prohibitions on our use of map information, financial penalties, criminal sanctions or loss of licenses or other authority to do business in those jurisdictions. any of these occurrences could adversely affect our ability to complete, improve, license or distribute our database, which could result in a competitive disadvantage for us and the possible loss of customers and revenue.if we cannot retain our existing management team or attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel, our business could be adversely affected. our success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our current executive officers, including judson c. green, president and chief executive officer, david b. mullen, executive vice president and chief financial officer, john k. macleod, executive vice president, global marketing and strategy and m. salahuddin khan, senior vice president, technology& development and chief technology officer and our other key employees, including management, sales, support, technical and services personnel. qualified employees are in high demand throughout technology-based industries, and our future success depends in significant part on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled employees and the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to work effectively as a team.if we fail to adapt our map database to changes in technology, we could lose our existing customers and be unable to attract new business. the market for products and services incorporating digital map information is evolving and is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, the introduction of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services. although our database currently can be used by our customers in a wide variety of applications, we will need to be able to maintain the compatibility of our map database with new products and services introduced as a result of technological changes. if we are unable to do so, demand for our database could decline and our revenue would be adversely affected.if we fail to establish and maintain relationships with third party sources of data used in our map database, our business is likely to suffer. we depend upon third party sources for data to build, maintain and enhance our database. in certain cases, this data is readily available only from limited third party sources and/or at significant cost. we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining our relationships with our current third party sources or that we will be able to continue to obtain data from them on acceptable terms or at all. we also cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable. in some cases, we may obtain data on less favorable terms in order to satisfy our customers' requirements. in addition, we may be unable to obtain data from additional sources that would allow us to enhance our existing coverage and expand our geographic coverage. our rights to use any data we obtain may be limited in scope and duration and subject to various other terms and restrictions that may reduce its usefulness to us. our inability to obtain data from our current sources or additional or alternative sources, or to use the acquired data for our intended purposes, may impair or delay the further development, updating and distribution of our database. any impairments or delays may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and cause us to lose revenue. further, if we must pay more for the data than we have in the past or acquire data on unfavorable terms to satisfy customer requirements, our profitability may be adversely affected.if our customers do not accurately report the amount of license fees owed to us, we will not receive all of the revenue to which we are entitled. except with respect to our automobile manufacturer customers for whom we make and distribute copies of our database, we rely on our customers to report the amount of license fees owed to us under our agreements with them. the majority of our agreements, including those with our key customers, give us the right to audit their records to verify this information. however, these audits can be expensive, time-consuming and possibly detrimental to our ongoing business relationships with our customers. as a result, to date we have only audited a small number of customers in any given year and have relied primarily on the accuracy of our customers' reports. to the extent those reports are inaccurate, the revenue we collect from our customers could be materially less than the amount we should be receiving from them. though we believe the revenue lost from underreporting has not been material historically, we cannot estimate the impact of underpayments in the future.errors or defects in the database we deliver to customers may expose us to risks of product liability claims and adversely affect our reputation, which could result in customer loss, decreased revenue, unexpected expenses and loss of market share. the use of our data in route guidance products and other navigation products and applications involves an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. claims could be made by our customers if errors or defects result in failure of their products or services, or by end-users of those products or services or others alleging loss or harm as a result of actual or perceived errors or defects in our map database. our potential exposure may increase as products and services incorporating our map database begin to be used more widely in emergency response or other safety-related applications and as the information included in earlier versions of our map database becomes dated or obsolete. in addition, errors or defects in our database may require us to participate in product recalls, or cause us to voluntarily initiate a recall in order to maintain good customer relationships. product liability claims present a risk of protracted litigation, substantial money damages, attorneys' fees, costs and expenses, and diversion of management's attention from the operation of our business. although we have not had any product liability claims brought against us to date, we cannot assure you that claims will not be brought in the future. we attempt to mitigate the risks of product liability claims through the use of disclaimers, limitations of liability and similar provisions in our license agreements; however, we cannot assure you that any of these provisions will prove to be effective barriers to claims. recalls also may be costly and divert management's attention from the operation of our business. in some circumstances, we are contractually obligated to indemnify our customers for liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of product liability claims. providing indemnification or contesting indemnification claims from our customers may result in our incurring substantial costs and expenses. in some cases, purchase orders submitted by our customers purport to incorporate certain customer-favorable contractual terms and conditions which, if given effect, could increase our potential product liability and recall liability exposure. in addition, adverse publicity may reduce our customers' willingness to incorporate our database and related applications into their products, which would adversely affect our revenue.our inability to adequately protect our map database property could enable others to market databases with similar coverage and features that may reduce demand for our database and adversely affect our revenue. we rely primarily on a combination of copyright laws, trade secrets, patents, database laws and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our database, software and related technology. we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our intellectual property from infringement, misappropriation or piracy will prove to be sufficient. current or potential competitors may use our intellectual property without our authorization in the development of databases, software or technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours, and even if we discover evidence of infringement, misappropriation or intellectual property piracy, our recourse against them may be limited or could require us to pursue litigation, which could involve substantial attorneys' fees, costs and expenses and diversion of management's attention from the operation of our business. our database is a compilation of public domain, licensed, otherwise-acquired and independently developed information obtained from various sources such as aerial photographs, commercially available maps and data, government records, other data sources and field observation. current or potential competitors may be able to use publicly available sources of information and techniques similar to ours to independently create a database containing substantially the same information as our database. any of these events likely would harm our competitive position. the laws of some countries in which we operate do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of other countries. for example, although our database and software are protected in part by copyright, database and trade secret rights, copyright protection does not extend to facts and legislative database protections that relate to compilations of facts currently exist only in certain countries of europe and do not exist in the united states or canada. in addition, as we continue to expand our geographic coverage outside of north america and europe, there may be little or no intellectual property protection and increased rates of piracy. further, we recently have begun to outsource some software development and data production functions to third parties located in foreign countries where we believe there is an increased risk of infringement, misappropriation and piracy and an increased possibility that we may not be able to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights. copies of our database that are distributed to end-users do not always include effective protection against unlawful copying. while we attempt to stop data piracy, our </td>

Prospective investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information set forth in the Prospectus before purchasing the Securities offered hereby. GENERAL BUSINESS RISKS The Company's business is subject to various business risks, including economic risks. Economic conditions affect the overall level of mortgage business activity. The decisions to buy, sell or refinance residences are affected by such economic conditions as changes in overall growth of the economy, the level of consumer confidence, real estate values, prevailing interest rates and investment returns expected by the financial community. These conditions could affect the number and size of mortgage loans of the types originated and purchased by the Company and make these mortgage loans less attractive to borrowers or investors. In addition, a decline in real estate values will have an adverse effect on the loan-to-value ratios for the related mortgage loans, weakening the collateral coverage and resulting in greater exposure in the event of a default. This greater exposure to default could make it more difficult for the Company to obtain interim financing for mortgage loans it originates or purchases or decrease the availability of purchasers of such mortgage loans or interest expected by the purchasers. See "Business" and "---Liabilities Under Representations and Warranties." Mortgage companies often offset the effects of an economic downturn where the economic downturn is caused by higher interest rates by servicing mortgages. Such servicers receive from the owners of the mortgages up to one-half of one per cent of the outstanding mortgage loan balance per annum and consequently have a continuing revenue stream during periods when the volume of new originations slows. The Company sells the servicing rights of all of the mortgage loans it originates or purchases. Not servicing mortgage loans subjects the Company to reliance upon the generation or purchase of mortgage loans for revenues and, consequently, subjects the Company to changes in the economic cycle and the general economic health in the geographic area or areas in which it operates.DEPENDENCE UPON WHOLESALE BROKERS During the year ended December 31, 1997, purchased loans from brokers accounted for approximately 84% of the mortgage loans closed by the Company, while the Company's retail division originated the remainder, approximately 16% of such mortgage loans. None of these brokers are contractually obligated to do business with the Company. Further, the Company's competitors also have relationships with the Company's brokers and actively compete with the Company in its efforts to expand its broker relationships. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining its existing relationships or expanding its broker and correspondent network. If the Company is not successful in maintaining or expanding its broker network, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. See "Business - Loan Production."DEPENDENCE UPON FUNDING SOURCES The Company's ability to originate and purchase mortgage loans depends to a large extent upon its ability to fund mortgage loans upon acceptable terms on an interim basis. The Company funds substantially all of the mortgage loans it purchases and originates through borrowings under collateralized loan purchase agreements with several commercial banks and thrifts which provide primary credit facilities upon which the Company relies. These agreements are generally terminable at will by either party. The Company's borrowings are in turn repaid with proceeds received by the Company when such mortgage loans are sold. The Company has relied upon a few lenders to provide the primary credit facilities for its loan originations and purchases. Accordingly, any failure to renew or obtain adequate funding under the Company's financing facilities or other financing arrangements, or any substantial reduction in the size of or increase in the cost of such facilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent the Company is not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financing, it may have to curtail its mortgage loan origination and purchase activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business - Funding of Mortgage Loans." 6DEPENDENCE ON PROGRAMS THAT PURCHASE LOANS OR GUARANTEE LOANS Institutional investors, which purchase all of the mortgage loans originated by the Company, generate funds by selling mortgage-backed securities and are largely dependent upon the continuation of programs administered by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae, which provide the context and facilitate the issuance of such securities. Although the Company is not aware of any proposed actions, the discontinuation of, or a significant reduction in, the operation of such programs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. In addition, the mortgage loan products eligible for such programs may be changed from time to time by the sponsor. The profitability of specific types of mortgage loan products may vary depending on a number of factors, including the administrative costs to the Company of purchasing or originating such types of mortgage loans. See "Business - Mortgage Loan Sales."COMPETITION The Company faces strong competition in originating, purchasing and selling mortgage loans and the related mortgage servicing rights. The Company's competition is principally from savings and loans associations, other mortgage companies, commercial banks and, to a lesser degree, credit unions and insurance companies, depending upon the type of mortgage loan product offered. Many of these institutions have greater financial and other resources than the Company and maintain a significant number of branch offices in the area in which theCompany conducts operations. Increased competition for mortgage loans from other lenders may result in a decrease in the volume of mortgage loans originated and purchased by the Company If the Company is unable to compete effectively, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. See "Business - Competition."LIABILITIES UNDER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES In the ordinary course of business, the Company makes representations and warranties to the purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans and the related mortgage servicing rights regarding compliance with laws, regulations and program standards. The Company generally receives similar representations and warranties from the brokers from whom it purchases mortgage loans. In the event of a breach of these representations and warranties, the Company may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans and/or may be liable for certain damages.However, in its twelve years of business, the Company has not been required to repurchase any mortgage loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience any such losses in the future. See "Business." INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS Changes in interest rates can have differing effects on various aspects of the Company's business, particularly in the areas of volume of mortgage loans originated and purchased, discussed above (See "Risk Factors -General Business Risks."), as well as net interest income and sales of mortgage loans. When the Company purchases or originates a loan, it usually has a commitment from a third party to purchase that loan. Generally, the Company funds the loan using borrowings from its lines of credit at commercial banks and thrifts known as warehouse lines of credit. The warehouse line of credit is repaid upon the sale of the warehoused loans. Before the Company sells the mortgage loan, it is entitled to receive interest income on the loan from the borrower and simultaneously pays interest expense to the institution providing the warehouse line of credit. The interest rate the Company receives during this period and the interest rate it pays are different. The profitability of the loan is affected by this difference and the fluctuations in interest rates before the mortgage loan is sold. Although the Company generally has a commitment to sell the mortgage loan before it commits to fund the mortgage loan, there are situations in which the Company does bear a risk in changing interest rates prior to the mortgage loan being sold. In particular, if the interest rates increase during the time before the Company sells the uncommitted mortgage loan but after it has funded the mortgage loan, the Company could sell the principal of the mortgage loan for less than the Company funded, thereby decreasing the mortgage loan's profitability or incurring a loss on the mortgage loan's sale. 7 To manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation between the time the mortgage loan is funded and sold, the Company engages in certain hedging activity by entering forward delivery contracts to sell mortgage-backed securities and forward delivery commitments for the sale of whole loans. Often the Company hedges more than 90% of the aggregate amount of the mortgage loans that have been warehoused or approved but not yet funded. Although this hedging activity is designed to reduce or eliminate risks related to interest rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that such hedging activity will be successful or that the Company will not incur significant losses in connection therewith. See "--- Sale of Mortgage Loan Servicing."INABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND MANAGE GROWTH Although the Company has experienced rapid and substantial growth in total revenues recently, there can be no assurance that the Company can sustain these rates of growth or that it will be able to continue to recruit and retain sufficient personnel to keep pace with a prolonged period of growth.SALE OF MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING The prices obtained by the Company upon the sale of mortgage loan servicing rights depend upon a number of factors, including the general supply of and demand for mortgage servicing rights, as well as prepayment and delinquency rates on the portfolios of mortgage servicing rights being sold.Interest rate changes can affect the profitability of the sale of mortgage loan servicing rights to a third party. Purchasers of mortgage loan servicing rights analyze a variety of factors to determine the purchase price they are willing to pay, including prepayment sensitivity of servicing rights. Because of the increased likelihood of prepayment in periods of declining interest rates, sales of mortgage loan servicing rights related to higher interest rate mortgage loans may be sold for less than in times of stable or increasing interest rates, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. See "Business - Mortgage Loan Sales."LEGISLATION AND REGULATION Federal, state and local authorities regulate and examine the origination, processing, underwriting, selling and servicing of mortgage loans. The Company is an approved seller/servicer of mortgage loans for Fannie Mae. In addition, the Company is an approved mortgagee by HUD. Among other consequences, the failure to comply with HUD or Fannie Mae regulations could prevent the Company from reselling its mortgage loans or prevent its ability to enter into the servicing of mortgage loans should it choose to do so. Such failure could also result in demands for indemnification or mortgage loan repurchase, certain rights of rescission for mortgage loans, class action law suits and administrative enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business results of operations and financial conditions. Federal, state and local governmental authorities also regulate theCompany's activities as a lender. The Truth in Lending Act ("TILA") and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder contain certain requirements designed to provide consumers with uniform, understandable information with respect to the terms and conditions of mortgage loans and credit transactions. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA") prohibits creditors from discriminating against applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age or marital status, among other restrictions and requirements. In instances where the applicant is denied credit, or the rate or charge for a mortgage loan increases as a result of information obtained from a consumer credit agency, the Fair Credit ReportingAct of 1970 requires the lender to supply the applicant with a name and address of the reporting agency. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Debt Collection Practices Act subject the Company to filing an annual report with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain compliance with these requirements in the future without additional expenses, or that more restrictive local, state or federal laws, rules and regulations will not be adopted or that existing laws and regulations will not be interpreted in a more restrictive manner, which would make compliance more difficult and more expensive for the Company.GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION All of the Company's mortgage loan originations and purchases for the year ended December 31, 1997, were derived from the San Francisco Bay area. The Company currently does no business outside the San Francisco Bay area and intends to continue its loan origination and purchases activity in the SanFrancisco Bay area. The Company is, however, studying business opportunities outside of the San Francisco Bay area, including other areas of California or Utah. There is no assurance that the Company will enter these or other markets or that if the Company does expand to new markets, it will generate sufficient revenues that exceed the costs associated with activities in such new markets or that the business activity in those new markets will match that achieved in theSan Francisco Bay area. Whether or not the Company enters into new geographic markets, the Company's results of operations and financial condition will be significantly affected by general trends in the economy of the San Francisco Bay area and its residential real estate market for the foreseeable future. 8 YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE The Company's computer systems may not comply with year 2000 issues.Over the next few years, the Company may incur additional expenditures to modify its software to operate correctly for the year 2000. While considered to be immaterial by management, the Company has not yet quantified such costs, which will be expensed as incurred. If the Company does not address this issue successfully, the Company's business could be materially and adversely affected.DEPENDENCE UPON KEY PERSONNEL The Company's business is substantially dependent on the efforts of Joseph Kristul, its Chief Executive Officer, and Maria Kristul, its President. Joseph Kristul and Maria Kristul are husband and wife. Both have executed employment agreements with the Company through December 31, 1999. Each may terminate the agreement for good reason in the event the executive has a reduction in title and/or compensation or the assignment of duties not consistent with those of a senior executive; the material breach by the Company of any provisions of the employment agreement; the relocation of the Company's principal executive offices to a location more than 25 miles from its present location; or a change in control of the Company, as defined. In defined circumstance the agreements provide for severance payments up to two times the executive's base salary. The Company has obtained key-man insurance in the face amount of $3,000,000 on the life of Mr. Kristul. There can be no assurance that amount will be sufficient to compensate the Company for the loss of Mr.Kristul's services. See "Management." ABSENCE OF PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET - AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock. The Company has applied to have the Common Stock listed on the American Stock Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Company's Common Stock will be approved for listing or if approved that the Company will be able to maintain the criteria for listing. Such listing, if granted, does not imply that a meaningful, sustained market for the Common Stock will develop. If a meaningful market does not develop or if the Company is not listed on the American StockExchange, holders of Common Stock may be unable to sell Common Stock or may be able to sell only at significantly lower prices than the original offering price. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the Common Stock offered hereby will develop or, if it should develop, will continue nor can there be any assurance that the Common Stock may be sold at its original offering price or at any other price. From time to time after this offering, there also may be significant volatility in the market price for the CommonStock. ARBITRARY DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE The public offering price for the Common Stock offered hereby was determined by negotiation between the Company and the Representative. The factors considered in determining the public offering price include the Company's revenue growth since its organization, the industry in which it operates, the Company's business potential and earning prospects and the general condition of the securities markets at the time of the offering. Prices for the shares of Common Stock after this offering will be determined in the market and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity of the market for the Common Stock, investor perception of the Company and the mortgage banking industry as a whole. See "Underwriting."IMMEDIATE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION The Company's current shareholders acquired their shares of Common Stock at a cost substantially below the price at which such shares are being offered in this offering. Consequently, investors purchasing the shares of Common Stock offered hereby will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of their investment. See "Dilution."INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS The Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that the liability of directors of the Company for monetary damages is eliminated to the fullest extent permitted under California law. The Company's Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify its directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding arising by reason of such person being or having been a director or officer to the fullest extent permitted underCalifornia law. Therefore, while the directors and officers may be accountable to the Company and its shareholders as fiduciaries, the Company and its shareholders have a more limited right of action than they would, absent the indemnification and limitation of liability provisions contained in the Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. 9 If available at reasonable cost, the Company intends to maintain insurance against any liability incurred by its officers and directors in defense of any actions to which they are made parties by reason of their positions as officers and directors. The Company does not presently have such insurance. The provisions of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation andBylaws and the Company's intent to obtain insurance on behalf of its officers and directors may reduce the likelihood of litigation against directors and may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty. See "Management Indemnification and Limitation on Liability." ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN CORPORATE CHARTER The Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company authorize the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval and subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Board of Directors which may have the effect of deterring a non-negotiated attempt to acquire control of the Company. There are currently no shares of preferred stock outstanding. A series of preferred stock could be issued in the future, for example, to thwart a possible take-over and may, in any event, operate to the significant disadvantage of the holders of Common Stock by including convertibility features which are lower than the market price for the CommonStock, which would dilute the value of existing shareholdings, including the shares of Common Stock issued in this offering. See "Description of Capital Stock - Preferred Stock." PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS Although the Company has paid dividends in the past as an S corporation, the Company's Board of Directors presently intends to retain all of the Company's earnings for the expansion of its business. The Company therefore does not anticipate the distribution of cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future decision of the Company's Board of Directors to pay cash dividends will depend, among other factors, upon the Company's earnings, financial position, and cash requirements. See "Dividend Policy."SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Upon completion of this offering, the Company's current shareholders will own 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock, which will represent 67.6% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (62.7% if the over-allotment option is exercised in full). Of such restricted shares of Common Stock, 2,468,750 have been held for more than one year and will be eligible for resale under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SecuritiesAct"), subject to volume and other limitations, beginning 90 days after the date of this Prospectus. All of such shares are held by an affiliate of the Company, the Kristul Family LLC. Another 31,250 shares will be eligible for sale on May 1, 1999, and the Company has granted options to purchase a total of 45,000 shares effective upon the completion of this offering. All existing shareholders of the Company have agreed not to sell, offer, contract to sell, or enter into any swap or similar agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic risk of ownership of the Common Stock, or otherwise dispose of any of their shares of Common Stock for a period of one year following the completion of this offering. The Company has also agreed to grant to theRepresentative warrants to acquire 120,000 shares of Common Stock. These shares have certain demand and piggyback registration rights. Sales of significant amounts of Common Stock by current shareholders in the public market after this offering or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. See "---Shares Eligible for FutureSale,""--- Effect of Representative's Warrants, "Principal and Selling Shareholders." and "Description of Capital Stock." CONTROL OF THE COMPANY The Kristul Family LLC, of which Joseph and Maria Kristul are managing members, will continue to own 66.7% of the Common Stock of the Company (61.9% if the Underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). Accordingly, they will be in a position to elect the Company's directors and officers, to control the policies and operations of the Company and to determine the outcome of corporate transactions or other matters submitted for shareholder approval, including mergers, consolidations, the sale of the Company's assets or a change in control of the Company. See "Principal and Selling Shareholder." 10BENEFITS TO CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS The Kristul Family LLC has pledged all of the stock owned by it in connection with certain borrowings of the Company and Joseph and Maria Kristul have personally guaranteed that debt as well as other debt of the Company. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions." This offering will benefit the Kristul Family LLC and Joseph and Maria Kristul because the proceeds of this offering will be used to repay the debt for which the stock is pledged resulting in the release of the stock pledge and the related personal guarantees. The existing warehouse lines are also personally guaranteed by Joseph and MariaKristul. Upon completion of this offering, the Company will seek to enter into new warehouse lines without such personal guarantees. In addition, the Kristul Family LLC will receive proceeds from the sale of the shares, if any, sold in connection with an exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment option. EFFECT OF REPRESENTATIVE'S WARRANTS. Until the date five years following the date of this Prospectus, the holders of the Representative's Warrants are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the Common Stock, with a resulting dilution in the interests of the other shareholders. The shares of Common Stock underlying theRepresentative's Warrants have certain registration rights. Further, the terms on which the Company might obtain additional financing during that period may be adversely affected by the existence of the Representative's Warrants. The holders of the Representative's Warrants may exercise the Representative's Warrants at a time when the Company might be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided herein. The Company has agreed that, under certain circumstances, it will register under federal and state securities laws the Representative's Warrants and/or the securities issuable thereunder. Exercise of these registration rights could involve substantial expense to the Company at a time when it could not afford such expenditures and may adversely affect the terms upon which theCompany may obtain financing. See "Description of Capital Stock" and "Underwriting." REPRESENTATIVE'S INFLUENCE ON THE MARKET A significant amount of the shares of Common Stock offered hereby may be sold to customers of the Representative. Such customers subsequently may engage in transactions for the sale or purchase of such Common Stock through or with the Representative. Although they have no obligation to do so, theRepresentative may otherwise effect transactions in such securities. Such market making activity may be discontinued at any time. If they participate in the market, the Representative may exert a dominating influence on the market, if one develops, for the Common Stock described in this Prospectus. The price and the liquidity of the Common Stock may be significantly affected by the degree, if any, of the Representative's participation in such market. 11</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock. our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed by any of these risks. the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our business and industry if we are unable to manage our growth effectively our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline. we have increased our number of full-time employees from 730 as of december31, 2005 to 2,021 as of december31, 2007 and have increased our revenue from $138.8 million in 2005 to $362.0million in 2007. the rapid growth of our business and our service offerings has strained our operating and financial resources. further, we intend to continue to expand our overall business, customer base, headcount, and operations. we also intend to expand our data center capacity and have acquired a 1.2million square foot facility in the san antonio, texas area to house our corporate operations and potentially additional data center facilities. further, we intend to expand our operations internationally. creating a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our operating and financial system capabilities and controls. if our information systems are unable to support the demands placed on them by our rapid growth, we may be forced to implement new systems which would be disruptive to our business. we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future due to the expenses associated with these expansions, which may negatively impact our gross margins or operating expenses. if we fail to improve our operational systems or to expand our customer service capabilities to keep pace with the growth of our business, we could experience customer dissatisfaction, cost inefficiencies, and lost revenue opportunities, which may materially and adversely affect our operating results.if we overestimate our data center capacity requirements, our operating margins and profitability could be adversely affected. the costs of construction, leasing, and maintenance of our data centers constitute a significant portion of our capital and operating expenses. in order to manage growth and ensure adequate capacity for new and existing customers while minimizing unnecessary excess capacity costs, we continuously evaluate our short and long-term data center capacity requirements. due to the lead time in expanding existing data centers or building new data centers, we are required to estimate demand for our services as far as two years into the future. we currently plan to substantially increase our infrastructure through the development of our new headquarters in the san antonio, texas area and the expansion of data centers in the u.s. and internationally. in contrast to our data centers that we have established to date, which were acquired relatively inexpensively as distressed assets of third parties, our current expansion plans may require us to pay full market rates for our new data center facilities. if we overestimate the demand for our services and therefore overbuild our data center capacity, our operating margins could be materially reduced, which would materially impair our profitability. if we underestimate our data center capacity requirements, our financial results and services could be impaired. if we underestimate our data center capacity requirements, we may not be able to service any expanding needs of our existing customers, or we may be required to limit new customer acquisition while we work to increase data center capacity to satisfy demand, either of which may materially impair our revenue growth.our physical infrastructure is concentrated in very few facilities, and any failure in our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions and could reduce our revenues, harm our business reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. our network and power supplies and data centers are subject to various points of failure, and a problem with our generators, ups, or uninterruptible power supply, routers, switches, or other equipment, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions for some or all of our customers or equipment damage. we currently manage eight data centers in the u.s. and the united kingdom, or u.k., and plan to consolidate two of our three existing data centers in the u.k. into our new data center space in slough, u.k. see the section entitled businessfacilities. because our hosting services do not require geographic proximity of our data centers to our customers, our hosting infrastructure is consolidated into a few large facilities. accordingly, any failure or downtime in one of our data center facilities could affect a significant percentage of our customers. while data backup services are included in our hosting services, the majority of our customers do not elect to pay the additional fees required to store their backup data offsite in a separate facility. the total destruction or severe impairment of any of our data center facilities could result in significant downtime of our services and the loss of vast amounts of customer data. since our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to provide customers with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions in our service could harm our reputation. the services we provide are subject to failure resulting from numerous factors, including: human error or accidents (such as an airplane crash into one of our facilities, some of which are located near major airports); power loss; equipment failure; internet connectivity downtime; improper building maintenance by the landlords of the buildings in which our facilities are located; physical or electronic security breaches; fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, and other natural disasters; water damage; terrorism; sabotage and vandalism; and failure by us or our vendors to provide adequate service to our equipment. additionally, in connection with the expansion or consolidation of our existing data center facilities from time to time, there is an increased risk that service interruptions may occur as a result of server relocation or other unforeseen construction-related issues. 9 we have experienced interruptions in service in the past, due to such things as power outages, power equipment failures, cooling equipment failures, routing problems, hard drive failures, database corruption, and other computer failures. during the fourth quarter of 2007, our data center operations in grapevine, texas were impaired for several hours due to separate incidents of simultaneous system failures. the system failures included the loss of our utility delivery systems which were damaged by two separate vehicle-related accidents as well as problems with certain redundant power and cooling systems in the data center. these system failures resulted in downtime for a substantial portion of the servers located in the facility. as a result of this downtime, we extended approximately $3.4 million in credits to our customers and may have suffered damage to our reputation with our customers. while we have not experienced larger than normal customer attrition following these events, the extent of any damage to our reputation is difficult to assess. although we are taking certain steps to avoid this situation in the future through upgrades to our cooling equipment and other infrastructure, service interruptions due to equipment failures, natural disasters, accidents, or otherwise could still materially impact our business. any future interruptions could: cause our customers to seek damages for losses incurred; require us to replace existing equipment or add redundant facilities; damage our reputation as a reliable provider of hosting services; cause existing customers to cancel or elect to not renew their contracts; or make it more difficult for us to attract new customers. any of these events could materially increase our expenses or reduce our revenues, which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.customers with mission-critical applications could potentially expose us to lawsuits for their lost profits or damages, which could impair our financial condition. because our hosting services are critical to many of our customers businesses, any significant disruption in our services could result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. although we typically require our customers to sign agreements that contain provisions attempting to limit our liability for service outages, we cannot assure you that a court would enforce any contractual limitations on our liability in the event that one of our customers brings a lawsuit against us as the result of a service interruption or other internet site or application problems that they may ascribe to us. the outcome of any such lawsuit would depend on the specific facts of the case and any legal and policy considerations that we may not be able to mitigate. in such cases, we could be liable for substantial damage awards that may significantly exceed our liability insurance coverage by unknown but significant amounts, which could seriously impair our financial condition.if we do not prevent security breaches, we may be exposed to lawsuits, lose customers, suffer harm to our reputation, and incur additional costs. we rely on third-party suppliers to protect our equipment and hardware against breaches in security and cannot be certain that they will provide adequate security. the services we offer involve the transmission of large amounts of sensitive and proprietary information over public communications networks as well as the processing and storage of confidential customer information. unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidents, employee error or malfeasance, fraudulent service plan orders, intentional misconduct by computer hackers, and other disruptions can occur that could compromise the security of our infrastructure, thereby exposing such information to unauthorized access by third parties and leading to interruptions, delays or cessation of service to our customers. techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, so we may be unable to implement security measures in a 10 timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could be circumvented as a result of accidental or intentional actions by parties within or outside of our organization. any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential customers, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs. although we typically require our customers to sign agreements that contain provisions attempting to limit our liability for security breaches, we cannot assure you that a court would enforce any contractual limitations on our liability in the event that one of our customers brings a lawsuit against us as the result of a security breach that they may ascribe to us. the outcome of any such lawsuit would depend on the specific facts of the case and legal and policy considerations that we may not be able to mitigate. in such cases, we could be liable for substantial damage awards that may significantly exceed our liability insurance coverage by unknown but significant amounts, which could seriously impair our financial condition.terrorist activity throughout the world and military action to counter terrorism could adversely impact our operating results. terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, as well as governments responses to such activities, may have an adverse effect on business, financial, and general economic conditions internationally. terrorist activities may disrupt our ability to provide our services or may increase our costs due to the need to provide enhanced security, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. these circumstances may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, our ability to raise capital, and the operation and maintenance of our facilities. we may not have adequate property and liability insurance to cover catastrophic events or attacks brought on by terrorist attacks and other acts of violence. in addition, we depend heavily on the physical infrastructure, particularly as it relates to power, that exists in the markets in which we operate. any damage to such infrastructure in these markets where we operate may materially and adversely affect our operating results.we rely on third-party hardware that may be difficult to replace or could cause errors or failures of our service, which could adversely affect our operating results or harm our reputation. we rely on hardware acquired from third parties in order to offer our services. this hardware may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms in quantities sufficient to meet our business needs, which could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. any errors or defects in third-party hardware could result in errors or a failure of our service, which could harm our reputation and operating results. indemnification from hardware providers, if any, would likely be insufficient to cover any damage to our business or our customers resulting from such hardware failure.we rely on third-party software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service that could lead to lost customers or harm to our reputation. we rely on software licensed from third parties to offer our services. this software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. any loss of the right to use any of this software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our business. any errors or defects in third-party software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our operating results by adversely affecting our revenues or operating costs.we provide service level commitments to our customers, which could require us to issue credits for future services if the stated service levels are not met for a given period and could significantly harm our revenue and our reputation. our customer agreements provide that we maintain certain service level commitments to our customers relating primarily to network uptime, critical infrastructure availability, and hardware 11 replacement. if we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with credits for future services. as a result, a failure to deliver services for a relatively short duration could cause us to issue these credits to a large number of affected customers. in addition, we cannot assure you that our customers will accept these credits in lieu of other legal remedies that may be available to them. our failure to meet our commitments could also result in substantial customer dissatisfaction or loss. because of the loss of future revenues through these credits, potential customer loss and other potential liabilities, our revenue could be significantly impacted if we cannot meet our service level commitments to our customers.if we are unable to maintain a high level of customer service, customer satisfaction and demand for our services could suffer. we believe that our future revenue growth depends on our ability to provide customers with quality service that not only meets our stated commitments, but meets and then exceeds customer service expectations. if we are unable to provide customers with quality customer support in a variety of areas, we could face customer dissatisfaction, decreased overall demand for our services, and loss of revenue. in addition, our inability to meet customer service expectations may damage our reputation and could consequently limit our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and negatively impact our operating results.we may not be able to continue to add new customers and increase sales to our existing customers, which could adversely affect our operating results. our growth is dependent on our ability to continue to attract new customers while retaining and expanding our service offerings to existing customers. growth in the demand for our services may be inhibited and we may be unable to sustain growth in our customer base, for a number of reasons, such as: our inability to market our services in a cost-effective manner to new customers; the inability of our customers to differentiate our services from those of our competitors or our inability to effectively communicate such distinctions; our inability to successfully communicate to businesses the benefits of outsourcing their hosting needs; the decision of businesses to host their internet sites and web infrastructure internally or in colocation facilities as an alternative to the use of our hosting services; our inability to penetrate international markets; our inability to expand our sales to existing customers; our inability to strengthen awareness of our brand; and reliability, quality or compatibility problems with our services. a substantial amount of our past revenue growth was derived from purchases of service upgrades by existing customers. our costs associated with increasing revenue from existing customers are generally lower than costs associated with generating revenue from new customers. therefore, a reduction in the rate of revenue increase from our existing customers, even if offset by an increase in revenue from new customers, could reduce our operating margins. any failure by us to continue attracting new customers or grow our revenue from existing customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. our existing customers could elect to reduce or terminate the services they purchase from us because we do not have long-term contracts with our customers, which could adversely affect our operating results. our customer contracts for our services typically have initial terms of one to two years, which unless terminated, may be renewed or automatically extended on a month-to-month basis. our customers have no obligation to renew their services after their initial contract periods expire. moreover, our customers could cancel their service agreements before they expire. our costs associated with maintaining revenue from existing customers are generally much lower than costs associated with generating revenue from new customers. therefore, a reduction in revenue from our existing customers, even if offset by an increase in revenue from new customers, could reduce our operating margins. any failure by us to continue to retain our existing customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our operating results may be harmed. we believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. if our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. this could negatively impact our future operating results. in addition, this offering may create disparities in personal wealth among rackspace hosting employees, which may adversely impact relations among employees and our corporate culture.if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees and management personnel, our growth strategy and our operating results could be harmed. our growth strategy depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain it professionals, technical engineers, operations employees, and sales and senior management personnel who maintain relationships with our customers and who can provide the technical, strategic, and marketing skills required for our company to grow. there is a shortage of qualified personnel in these fields, specifically in the san antonio, texas area, where we are headquartered and a majority of our employees are located, and we compete with other companies for this limited pool of potential employees. there is no assurance that we will be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel, and this failure could cause our operations and financial results to be negatively impacted. our success and future growth also depends to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our management team, especially graham weston, our chairman, and a. lanham napier, our president and chief executive officer. we do not have employment agreements with, or maintain key man insurance on, any members of our management team, including messrs. weston and napier.our business is affected by changes in the state of the general economy, and a slowdown or downturn in the general economy could disproportionately affect the demand for our services. our customers include a range of organizations whose success is intrinsically linked to the health of the economy generally. as a result, fluctuations, disruptions, instability or downturns in the general economy could disproportionately affect demand for our services. for example, such fluctuations, disruptions, instability or downturns may cause our customers to do the following: cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our services; seek to lower their costs by renegotiating their contracts with us; 13 move their hosting services in-house; or switch to lower-priced solutions provided by our competitors. if such conditions occur and persist, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations. our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including many of the risks described in this section, which are outside of our control. as a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. you should not rely on our operating results for any prior periods as an indication of our future operating performance. fluctuations in our revenue can lead to even greater fluctuations in our operating results. our budgeted expense levels depend in part on our expectations of long-term future revenue. given relatively fixed operating costs related to our personnel and facilities, any substantial adjustment to our expenses to account for lower than expected levels of revenue will be difficult and take time. consequently, if our revenue does not meet projected levels, our operating expenses would be high relative to our revenue, which would negatively affect our operating performance. if our revenue or operating results do not meet or exceed the expectations of investors or securities analysts or fall below any guidance we may in the future provide to the market, the price of our common stock may decline.increased energy costs, power outages, and limited availability of electrical resources may adversely affect our operating results. our data centers are susceptible to increased regional, national or international costs of power and to electrical power outages. our customer contracts do not allow us to pass on any increased costs of energy to our customers, which could harm our business. further, power requirements at our data centers are increasing as a result of the increasing power demands of todays servers. increases in our power costs could harm our operating results and financial condition. since we rely on third parties to provide our data centers with power sufficient to meet our needs, our data centers could have a limited or inadequate amount of electrical resources necessary to meet our customer requirements. we attempt to limit exposure to system downtime due to power outages by using backup generators and power supplies. however, these protections may not limit our exposure to power shortages or outages entirely. any system downtime resulting from insufficient power resources or power outages could damage our reputation and lead us to lose current and potential customers, which would harm our operating results and financial condition.increased internet bandwidth costs and network failures may adversely affect our operating results. our success depends in part upon the capacity, reliability, and performance of our network infrastructure, including the capacity leased from our internet bandwidth suppliers. we depend on these companies to provide uninterrupted and error-free service through their telecommunications networks. some of these providers are also our competitors. we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. we have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions or delays in network service. any failure on our part or the part of our third-party suppliers to achieve or maintain high data transmission capacity, reliability or performance could significantly reduce customer demand for our services and damage our business. 14 as our customers usage of telecommunications capacity increases, we will need to make additional investments in our capacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited or the cost of which may be on terms unacceptable to us. if adequate capacity is not available to us as our customers usage increases, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission capacity, reliability or performance. in addition, our business would suffer if our network suppliers increased the prices for their services and we were unable to pass along the increased costs to our customers.we may not be able to renew the leases on our existing facilities on terms acceptable to us, if at all, which could adversely affect our operating results. we do not own the facilities occupied by our current data centers, but occupy them pursuant to commercial leasing arrangements. the initial terms of our existing data center leases expire over a period ranging from 2008 to 2015, with each having at least one renewal period of five years, except for our hong kong lease, which has two three-year renewal periods. upon the expiration or termination of our data center facility leases, we may not be able to renew these leases on terms acceptable to us, if at all. if we fail to renew any data center lease and are required to move the data center to a new facility, we would face significant challenges due to the technical complexity, risk, and high costs of relocating the equipment. for example, if we are required to migrate customer servers to a new facility, such migration could result in significant downtime for our affected customers. this could damage our reputation and lead us to lose current and potential customers, which would harm our operating results and financial condition. even if we are able to renew the leases on our existing data centers, we expect that rental rates, which will be determined based on then-prevailing market rates with respect to the renewal option periods and which will be determined by negotiation with the landlord after the renewal option periods, will be higher than rates we currently pay under our existing lease agreements. if we fail to increase revenue in our existing data centers by amounts sufficient to offset any increases in rental rates for these facilities, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.we could be required to repay substantial amounts of money to certain state and local governments if we lose tax exemptions or grants previously awarded to us, which could adversely affect our operating results. on august3, 2007, we entered into a lease for approximately 67 acres of land and a 1.2million square foot facility in windcrest, texas, which is in the san antonio, texas area, to house our corporate headquarters and potentially a future data center operation. see the section entitled businessfacilities. in connection with this lease, we also entered into a master economic incentives agreement with the cities of windcrest and san antonio, texas; bexar county; and certain other parties, pursuant to which we agreed to locate existing and future employees at the new facility location. the agreement requires that we meet certain employment levels each year, with an ultimate employee base requirement of 4,500 jobs by december31, 2012. in addition, the agreement requires that the median compensation of those employees be no less than $51,000 per year. in exchange for meeting these employment obligations, the parties agreed to enter into the lease structure, pursuant to which, as a lessee of the windcrest economic development corporation, we will not be subject to most of the property taxes associated with the property for a 14 year period. if we fail to meet these job creation requirements, we could lose a portion or all of the tax benefit being provided during the 14-year period by having to pay pilot payments to the city of windcrest. the amount of the pilot payment would be calculated based on the amount of taxes that would have been owed for that period if the property were not exempt, and then such amount would be adjusted pursuant to certain factors, such as the percentage of employment achieved compared to the stated requirements. 15 in connection with this arrangement, the cities of san antonio and windcrest entered into an agreement to move part of the boundary line between the two cities. this resulted in the land on which our new facility is located and additional contiguous property, which was formerly part of the city of san antonio, becoming part of the city of windcrest. after we entered into this arrangement, a neighboring property owner challenged the constitutionality of the boundary change. if such challenge is successful, our facility would revert back into the boundaries of san antonio and we would be required to pay property taxes to san antonio. further, we entered into an agreement with the state of texas under which we could receive up to $22.0 million in state enterprise fund grants in four installments on the condition that we meet certain employment levels each year, with a requirement that we ultimately create at least 4,000 new jobs in the state of texas paying an average compensation of at least $56,000 per year (subject to a 2%per year increase commencing in 2009) by december31, 2012. we must sustain these jobs through december31, 2018. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we would be required to repay all or a portion of the grants plus interest. the loss of any anticipated tax benefits or grants described above or the repayment of the grant funds from the state of texas could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or results of operations.we have significant debt obligations that include restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility to manage our business; failure to comply with these covenants could trigger an acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness and adversely affect our financial position and operating results. as of march 31, 2008, outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility totaled approximately $77.3million. our credit facility requires that we maintain specific financial ratios and comply with covenants, including financial covenants, which contain numerous restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, sell assets, enter into affiliate transactions and take other actions. see the section entitled description of indebtedness. further, our</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors an investment in our ordinary shares involves risks. you should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, before investing in our ordinary shares. risks related to our business and industry conditions in the global and regional economy and the major end markets we serve may materially and adversely affect the business and results of operations of our businesses should they deteriorate. our business and operating results have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions, including conditions in the end markets we serve. the level of demand for our products depends, in part, on the general economic conditions that exist in our served end markets. a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from customers in cyclical industries that typically are adversely affected by downward economic cycles. our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing as a result of the effects of contraction or low levels of economic growth, disruptions in the financial markets, weak consumer and business confidence, high levels of unemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, fluctuating commodity prices, bankruptcies and other challenges affecting the global economy, as happened following the global recession in 2008. for example, our historical results have been highly correlated to global industrial activity and utilization and decreases in such activity or utilization may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. as a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. further, our suppliers, distributors and vendors may experience similar conditions, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. if conditions in the global economy or in the regions and major end markets that we serve deteriorate, demand for our products and services may be decline and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.we are subject to economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our business and our strategy to capitalize on our global reach. one of our key strategies is to capitalize on our global commercial reach, and a substantial portion of our operations are conducted and located outside the united states. for fiscal 2016, approximately 61% of our net sales originated from outside of the united states. we have manufacturing, sales and service facilities spanning five continents and sell to customers in over 120 countries. moreover, a significant amount of our manufacturing functions and sources of our raw materials and components are from emerging markets such as china, india and eastern europe. accordingly, our business and results of operations, as well as the business and results of operations of our vendors, suppliers and customers, are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: instability in a specific countrys or regions political, economic or social conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate; imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate income or capital in a tax efficient manner; trade protection measures, such as tariff increases and embargoes, and import and export licensing and control requirements; the complexities of operating within multiple tax jurisdictions, including potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or from tax examinations, which may, in addition, require an extended period of time to resolve; 27 partial or total expropriation by local, state or national governments; uncertainties as to local laws regarding, and enforcement of, contract and intellectual property rights; the ability to comply with or effect of complying with complex and changing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, including differing and, in some cases, more stringent labor and environmental regulations; differing local product preferences and product requirements; and difficulties involved in staffing and managing widespread operations, including challenges in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures. the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. certain regions, including latin america, asia, the middle east and africa, are generally more economically and politically volatile and as a result, our operations in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations in future periods. the new u.s. administration has publicly supported certain potential tax and trade proposals, modifications to international trade policy and other changes which may affect u.s. trade relations with other countries. in addition, economic and political uncertainty arose out of the june23, 2016 vote in the united kingdom that resulted in the decision to leave the european union (the e.u.). it is possible that these or other changes, if enacted, may impact or require us to modify our current business practices. at the present time, it is unclear as to the ultimate impact of these changes, policies or proposals and, as such, we are unable to determine the effect, if any, that such changes, policies or proposals would have on our business. additionally, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain european countries and the ability of these countries to meet future financial obligations, as well as concerns regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual euro-area countries. if a country within the euro area were to default on its debt or withdraw from the euro currency, or if the euro were to be dissolved entirely, the impact on markets around the world, and on our global business, could be immediate and material. such a development could cause financial and capital markets within and outside europe to constrict, thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business, and also could cause a substantial reduction in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact sales. any one of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.if we are unable to obtain raw materials at favorable prices in sufficient quantities, or at the time we require them, our operating margins and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. we purchase our energy, steel, aluminum, rubber and rubber-based materials, chemicals, polymers and other key manufacturing inputs from outside sources. we do not traditionally have long-term pricing contracts with raw material suppliers. the costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control. in recent years, the prices for energy, metal alloys, polymers and certain other of our raw materials have fluctuated significantly. while we strive to avoid this risk by using price escalation mechanisms with respect to our raw materials in certain of our customer contracts and we also seek to offset our increased costs with gains achieved through operational efficiencies, if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials on to our customers, we experience a lag in our ability to pass increases to our customers, or operational efficiencies are not achieved, our operating margins and results of operations may be materially adversely. additionally, our businesses compete globally for key production inputs. the availability of qualified suppliers and of key inputs may be disrupted by market disturbances or any number of geopolitical factors, 28 including political unrest and significant weather events. such disruptions may require additional capital or operating expenditure by us or force reductions in our production volumes. in the event of an industry-wide general shortage of certain raw materials or key inputs, or a shortage or discontinuation of certain raw materials or key inputs from one or more of our suppliers, we may not be able to arrange for alternative sources of certain raw materials or key inputs. any such shortage may materially adversely affect our competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source such raw materials or key inputs.adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key channel partners could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key channel partners, including distributors, that have valuable relationships with end users. some of these channel partners may also sell our competitors products, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. adverse changes in our relationships with these channel partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. in addition, the consolidation of channel partners and customers in certain of our end markets could adversely impact our profitability.we face competition in all areas of our business and may not be able to successfully compete with our competitors, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. we are subject to competition from other producers of products that are similar to ours. we compete on a number of factors, including product performance, quality, value, product availability, brand recognition, customer service and innovation and technology. our customers often demand delivery of our products on a tight time schedule and in a number of geographic markets. if our quality of service declines or we cannot meet the demands of our customers, they may utilize the services or products of our competitors. our competitors include manufacturers that may be better capitalized, may have a more extensive low-cost sourcing strategy and presence in low-cost regions or may receive significant governmental support and as a result, may be able to offer more aggressive pricing. our competitors also may develop products that are superior to our products, or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. if we are unable to continue to provide technologically superior or better quality products or to price our products competitively, our ability to compete could be harmed and we could lose customers or market share.pricing pressures from our customers may materially adversely affect our business. we generate strong margins by selling premium products at premium prices. accordingly, our margins could suffer if our customers are no longer willing to pay a premium for our product and service offerings. we face the greatest pricing pressure from our customers in the automotive first-fit end market. virtually all vehicle manufacturers seek price reductions in both the initial bidding process and during the term of the award. we are also, from time to time, subject to pricing pressures from customers in our other end markets. if we are not able to offset price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or new product introduction, those price reductions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.we are dependent on the continued operation of our manufacturing facilities and we may need to make investments in new or existing facilities. while we are not heavily dependent on any single manufacturing facility, major disruptions at a number of our manufacturing facilities, due to labor unrest, adverse weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, significant 29 mechanical failure of our facilities, or other catastrophic event, could result in significant interruption of our business and a potential loss of customers and sales or could significantly increase our operating costs. in addition, we may need to make investments in new or existing manufacturing facilities to adapt our production capacity to changing market conditions and to align with our growth strategies. the costs of such investments may be significant and we may not realize the expected benefits on our anticipated timeframe or at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or meet significant increases in demand for our products. certain of our businesses operate with short lead times and we order raw materials and supplies and plan production based on discussions with our customers and internal forecasts of demand. if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products, in terms of both volume and specific products, or react appropriately to abrupt changes in demand, we may experience delayed product shipments and customer dissatisfaction. if demand increases significantly from current levels, both we and our suppliers may have difficulty meeting such demand, particularly if such demand increases occur rapidly. additionally, we may carry excess inventory if demand for our products decreases below projected levels. failure to accurately forecast demand or meet significant increases in demand could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the international markets in which we operate. we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of functional currencies. we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs may be denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn and report revenues and vice versa. in addition, a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the u.s. dollar could reduce our profits from non-u.s. operations and the translated value of the net assets of our non-u.s. operations when reported in u.s. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. for example, in fiscal 2016, movements in average currency translation rates adversely affected our sales growth by $67.7million. ongoing movements in average currency translation rates in the future could continue to have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in u.s. dollars. fluctuations in currencies may also make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. we anticipate that there will be instances in which costs and revenues will not be exactly matched with respect to currency denomination. as a result, to the extent we continue to expand geographically, we expect that increasing portions of our revenues, costs, assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations. we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. further, the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency, resulting in our inability to hedge against these risks. we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into u.s. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. actions of this nature, if they occur or continue for significant periods of time, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in any given period.we are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for continued revenue growth. the markets in which we operate are subject to technological change. our long-term operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, 30 to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements and evolving industry standards. the development of new product introductions and product innovations may require significant investment by us. there are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands. for example, the increased adoption of electric vehicles may affect certain of the end markets that we serve and could alter the application platforms in which we offer solutions. if we are unable to adapt to technological changes, including by developing and marketing new products, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.we have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions, which may expose us to additional risk and we may not be able to maintain the level of cost reductions that we have achieved. we have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, divested non-core businesses, consolidated manufacturing operations and reduced our employee population. the impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors and we may not be able to maintain the level of cost savings that we have achieved depending on our ability to successfully complete these efforts. in connection with the implementation and maintenance of our cost reduction measures, we may face delays in anticipated workforce reductions, a decline in employee morale and a potential inability to meet operational targets due to an inability to retain or recruit key employees.we are subject to risks from litigation, legal and regulatory proceedings and obligations that may materially impact our operations. we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and proceedings. we are involved in various tax, intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits, and other legal, antitrust and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim, lawsuit or proceeding and the range of probable loss, we believe these claims, lawsuits and proceedings will not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our results. however, we could, in the future, be subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings, including, amongst others, tax, intellectual property, product liability, product warranty, environmental claims and antitrust claims, and we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and/or prohibit us from selling our products. third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property rights. any claim relating to intellectual property infringement that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, if we are found to be willfully infringing another partys patents, for past use of the asserted intellectual property and royalties and other consideration going forward if we are forced to take a license. in addition, if any such claim were successfully asserted against us, we may be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, selling or otherwise commercializing our products, product candidates or other technology, or those we develop with our r&d partners. even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns. in addition, first-fit and other manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of 31 aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims. first-fit manufacturers have brought such claims in federal court and with the u.s. international trade commission and with various foreign government agencies. to the extent first-fit and other manufacturers are seeking and obtaining more utility and design patents than they have in the past and are successful in asserting infringement of these patents and defending their validity, if any of our products are found to infringe someones patent, we could be restricted or prohibited from selling such products, which could have an adverse effect on our business. if we are sued for intellectual property infringement, we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims, even if we prevail. in addition, certification by independent organizations of certain of our aftermarket products may be revoked or adversely affected by first-fit manufacturer claims. lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization.failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights against counterfeiting activities could adversely affect our business. although we routinely conduct anti-counterfeiting activities in multiple jurisdictions, we have encountered counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent such counterfeiting activities by others. if we are unsuccessful in challenging such products on the basis of trademark or other intellectual property infringement, continued sales of such imitating products may adversely affect market share and impact customer perceptions and demand, leading to the shift of consumer preference away from our products and loss of market share.we will not seek to protect our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions throughout the world and we may not be able to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights even in the jurisdictions where we seek protection. filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we do not pursue and obtain patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where the ability to enforce our patent rights is not as strong as in the united states. these products may compete with our products, and our intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent such competition. in addition, we may face significant expenses in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states. if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.failure to develop, obtain, enforce and protect intellectual property rights or liability for intellectual property infringement could adversely affect our business. our success depends on our ability to develop technologies and inventions used in our products and to brand such products, to obtain intellectual property rights in such technologies, inventions, and brands, and to protect and enforce such intellectual property rights. in this regard, we rely on u.s. and foreign trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as license agreements, nondisclosure agreements, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions. nevertheless, the technologies and inventions developed by our engineers in the future may not prove to be as valuable as those of competitors, or competitors may develop similar or identical technologies and inventions independently of us and before we do. 32 we may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights in our new technologies and inventions or, if we do, the scope of such rights may not be sufficiently broad to afford us any significant commercial advantage over our competitors. owners of patents or other intellectual property rights that we need to conduct our business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to us on terms we consider reasonable. competitors and other third parties may challenge the ownership, validity, and/or enforceability of our patents or other intellectual property rights. further, we expect pirates to continue to counterfeit certain of our products using our trademarks, which has led to, and will likely continue to cause loss of sales. it is difficult to police such counterfeiting, particularly on a worldwide basis, and the efforts we take to stop such counterfeiting may not be effective. our other efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights against infringers may not prove successful and will likely be time consuming and expensive and may divert managements attention from the day-to-day operation of our business. adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an infringement or unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, successful assertion of our intellectual property rights depends on the judicial strength and willingness of the issuing jurisdictions to enact and enforce sufficient intellectual property laws. creation and enforcement of intellectual property rights is a relatively recent development in much of the world, and so some time may be necessary to realize reliable intellectual property systems across all markets and jurisdictions, if this occurs at all. we operate in industries with respect to which there are many third-party patents. owners of patents or other intellectual property rights that we need to conduct our business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to us on terms we consider reasonable. we cannot assure you that our business operations, products and methods do not or will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. any claim relating to intellectual property infringement that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, if we are found to be willfully infringing another partys patents, for past use of the asserted intellectual property and royalties and other consideration going forward if we are forced to take a license. in addition, if any such claim were successfully asserted against us, we may be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, selling or otherwise commercializing our products, product candidates or other technology, or those we develop with our r&d partners. if we are sued for intellectual property infringement, we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims, even if we prevail. any of these risks coming to fruition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.we may be subject to recalls, product liability claims or may incur costs related to product warranties that may materially and adversely affect our business. meeting or exceeding many government-mandated safety standards is costly and requires manufacturers to remedy defects related to product safety through recall campaigns if the products do not comply with safety, health or environmental standards. if we, customers or government regulators determine that a product is defective or does not comply with such standards prior to the start of production, the launch of a product could be delayed until such defect is remedied. the costs associated with any protracted delay of a product launch or a recall campaign to remedy defects in products that have been sold could be substantial. we face an inherent risk of product liability claims if product failure results in any claim for injury or loss. supplier consolidation and the increase in low-cost country sourcing may increase the likelihood of receiving defective materials, thereby increasing the risk of product failure and resulting liability claims. litigation is inherently unpredictable and these claims, regardless of their outcome, may be costly, divert management attention and adversely affect our reputation. although we have liability insurance, we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate. in addition, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us. 33 from time to time, we receive product warranty claims from our customers, pursuant to which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. vehicle manufacturers are increasingly requiring their outside suppliers to participate in the warranty of their products and to be responsible for the operation of these component products in new vehicles sold to consumers. warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. it cannot be assured that costs associated with providing product warranties will not be material.we are subject to anti-corruption laws in various jurisdictions, as well as other laws governing our international operations. if we fail to comply with these laws we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our international operations are subject to one or more anti-corruption laws in various jurisdictions, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended (the fcpa), the u.k. bribery act of 2010 and other anti-corruption laws. the fcpa and these other laws generally prohibit employees and intermediaries from bribing or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. we

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS An investment in the Common Stock of the Company involves certain risks Prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors, which constitute all the material risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Prospectus, in evaluating an investment in the Common Stock offered hereby CAPITAL NEEDS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS Negative Cash Flow. The Company has operated, and expects to continue to operate, on a negative cash flow basis due to increases in the volume of loan originations and purchases and due to the growth of its securitization programIn securitizations, the Company recognizes a gain on sale for the loans securitized upon the closing of the securitization and incurs associated taxes and expenses but does not receive the cash representing such gain until it receives the cash flows from the interest-only and residual certificates and from servicing of the loans, which is payable over the actual life of the loans securitized. For the six months ended June 30, 1996, the Company operated on a negative cash flow basis using $8.2 million more in operations than was generated. Currently, the Company's primary cash requirements include the funding of (i) mortgage originations and purchases pending their pooling and sale, (ii) the points and expenses paid in connection with the acquisition of correspondent loans, (iii) fees, expenses and tax payments incurred in connection with its securitization program, and (iv) ongoing administrative and other operating expenses. The Company funds these cash requirements primarily through warehouse and other financing facilities, securitizations and whole loan sales. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources.' Dependence on Securitizations. The Company relies significantly upon securitizations to generate cash proceeds for repayment of its warehouse facilities and to create availability to originate and purchase additional loans. Further, gains on sale of loans generated by the Company's securitizations represent a significant portion of the Company's revenuesSeveral factors affect the Company's ability to complete securitizations, including conditions in the securities markets generally, conditions in the asset-backed securities market specifically, the credit quality of the Company's portfolio of loans and the Company's ability to obtain credit enhancement. If the Company were unable to profitably securitize a sufficient number of loans in a particular financial reporting period, then the Company's revenue for such period would decline and could result in lower income or a loss for such periodIn addition, unanticipated delays in closing the securitizations could increase the Company's interest rate risk by increasing the warehousing period for its loans. The Company has relied on credit enhancements provided by monoline insurance carriers to guarantee outstanding investor certificates in the related trusts to enable it to obtain an AAA/Aaa rating for such investor certificatesThe Company has not attempted to structure a mortgage loan pool for sale through a securitization based solely on the internal credit enhancements of the pool or the Company's credit. Any substantial reductions in the size or availability of such insurance policies, or increases in the price charged by, or required level of protection to be provided to, the insurance companies issuing such policies, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources' and 'Business--Loan Sales.' Dependence on Warehouse and Residual Financing Sources. The Company funds substantially all of the loans which it purchases and originates through borrowings under warehouse financing facilities, through repurchase agreements and through internally generated funds. The Company's borrowings are in turn repaid with the proceeds received by the Company from selling such loans through securitizations or whole loan sales. The Company has relied upon a few lenders to provide the primary credit facilities for its loan originations and purchases; however, currently, management believes there are alternative sources for such credit facilities. Any failure to renew or obtain adequate funding under these warehouse financing facilities or other financing arrangements, or any substantial reduction in the size of or increase in the cost of such facilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that the Company is not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financing, it would not be able to hold a large volume of loans pending securitization and therefore would have to curtail its loan production activities or sell loans either through whole loan sales or in smaller securitizations, thereby having a material adverse effect on the 8 Company's results of operations and financial condition. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources.' The Company has relied upon residual financing agreements (credit facilities secured by interest-only and residual certificates) to fund the tax consequences of the recognition of the gains on sale when a securitization occurs and other working capital needs prior to receipt of any cash flow from the interest-only and residual certificates retained by the Company in its securitizations. The Company has no commitments for future residual financing, as such financings are typically obtained at the time of a securitization. If the Company is unable to maintain its existing residual financing agreements and to secure adequate funding or financing under additional residual financing arrangements, or there is any substantial increase in the cost of such facilities, it may be forced to either curtail its growth or to sell its loans through whole loan sales which would have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Need for Additional Financing. The Company anticipates that the net proceeds from the Offering, together with the funds available under the warehouse facilities and additional residual financing arrangements, will be sufficient to fund its operations for the next 12 months, if the Company's future operations are consistent with management's expectations. The Company may need to seek additional financing thereafter. The Company has no existing commitments for additional residual financing arrangements, as such financings are typically obtained at the time of a securitization, or for other additional financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain financing on a favorable or timely basis. The type, timing and terms of financing selected by the Company will depend upon the Company's cash needs, the availability of other financing sources and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. Future financing will likely involve the issuance of equity securities which may result in further dilution to existing stockholders. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources.' VALUATION AND POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF INTEREST-ONLY AND RESIDUAL CERTIFICATES As a fundamental part of its business and financing strategy, the Company sells substantially all of its loans through securitizations. In a securitization, the Company sells loans that it has originated or purchased to a trust for a cash purchase price and an interest in the loans securitized. The cash purchase price is raised through an offering of pass-through certificates by the trust. Following the securitization, purchasers of the pass-through certificates receive the principal collected and the investor pass-through interest rate on the principal balance, while the Company receives the cash flows from the interest-only and residual certificates and servicing of the loans. Excess Servicing. The Excess Servicing represents, over the life of the loans, the excess of the weighted average coupon on each pool of loans sold over the sum of the pass-through interest rate plus a servicing fee, a trustee fee, a bond insurance fee and an estimate of annual future credit losses related to the loans ('Excess Servicing'). The majority of the Company's gross income is recognized as gain on sale of loans, which represents the present value of the interest-only and residual certificates and servicing, less closing and underwriting costs. The Company recognizes such gain on sale of loans in the fiscal quarter in which such loans are sold, although cash is received by the Company over the life of the loansConcurrent with recognizing such gain on sale, the Company records the capitalized Excess Servicing as an asset on its balance sheet, represented by interest-only and residual certificates. At June 30, 1996, the Company's balance sheet reflected interest-only and residual certificates of $43.2 million and these certificates are reduced as cash distributions are received from the trust holding the loans pooled and sold. Although management of the Company believes that it has made reasonable estimates, on a pool-by-pool basis, of the Excess Servicing likely to be realized, it should be recognized that assumptions utilized by the Company represent estimates. Actual experience may vary from these estimates. The cash flows are projected over the life of the interest-only and residual certificates using prepayment, default and interest rate assumptions that market participants would use for similar financial instruments, subject to prepayment, credit and interest rate risks. These cash flows are discounted using an interest rate that market participants would use for similar financial instruments. The fair valuation also includes considerations of loan type, size, date of origination, interest rate, term, collateral value and geographic location. If the Company's assumptions used in deriving the value of interest-only and residual certificates differ from the actual results, future cash flows and 9 earnings could be negatively affected and the Company may be required to write down the value of its interest-only and residual certificates. Furthermore, there is no liquid market for interest-only and residual certificatesTherefore, no assurance can be given that all or any portion of the interest-only and residual certificates could be sold at any price, including at their stated value on the balance sheet, if at all. See '--Contingent Risks' and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Certain Accounting Considerations.' CONTROL BY EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS Immediately after the Offering, the Existing Stockholders will beneficially own an aggregate of 72.7% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. Giving full effect to the issuance of 500,000 options which will be granted upon consummation of the Offering, the Existing Stockholders will beneficially own an aggregate of 71.5% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common StockAccordingly, such persons, if they were to act in concert, would have majority control of the Company, with the ability to approve certain fundamental corporate transactions (including mergers, consolidations and sales of assets) and to elect all members of the Board of Directors. As long as the Millers are the controlling stockholders of the Company, third parties will not be able to gain control of the Company through purchases of Common Stock not beneficially owned or otherwise controlled by the Millers. Accordingly, the price of the Common Stock offered hereby would not reflect any premium which may be attributable to such ability to exercise or obtain control over the Company. See '--Effects of Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions,' 'Principal Stockholders' and 'Description of Capital Stock--Certain Charter, Bylaw and Statutory Provisions.' ECONOMIC CONDITIONS General. The Company's business may be adversely affected by periods of economic slowdown or recession which may be accompanied by decreased demand for consumer credit and declining real estate values. In the mortgage business, any material decline in real estate values reduces the ability of borrowers to use the equity in their homes to support borrowings and increases the loan-to-value ratios of loans previously made by the Company, thereby weakening collateral coverage and increasing the possibility of a loss in the event of defaultDelinquencies, foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of the Company's focus on credit-impaired borrowers in the home equity loan market, the actual rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on such loans could be higher under adverse economic conditions than delinquencies, foreclosures and losses currently experienced in the mortgage lending industry in general. In addition, in an economic slowdown or recession, the Company's actual costs of servicing the loans may increase without an increase in the servicing fee paid to the Company under its securitizations. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures, losses or increased costs could adversely affect the Company's ability to sell, and could increase the cost of selling, loans through securitization or a whole loan basis, which could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Interest Rates. The Company's profitability may be directly affected by the levels of and fluctuations in interest rates, which affect the Company's ability to earn a spread between interest received on its loans and the costs of borrowing. The profitability of the Company is likely to be adversely affected during any period of unexpected or rapid changes in interest rates. For example, a substantial or sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect the ability of the Company to purchase and originate loans and would reduce the value of loans that were originated prior to such increase. A significant decline in interest rates could decrease the size of the Company's loan servicing portfolio by increasing the level of loan prepayments. Additionally, to the extent Excess Servicing has been capitalized on the books of the Company, higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments or losses could require the Company to write down the value of such Excess Servicing, adversely impacting earnings. Fluctuating interest rates also may affect the net interest income earned by the Company, resulting from the difference between the yield to the Company on fixed rate loans held pending sale and the interest paid by the Company for funds borrowed under the Company's warehouse financing facilities at variable rates. In addition, inverse or flattened interest yield curves could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the Company because the loans pooled and sold by the Company are priced upon long-term interest rates, while the senior interests in the related REMIC trusts are priced on the basis of intermediate rates. While the Company monitors 10 the interest rate environment and currently employs a hedging strategy designed to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, there can be no assurance that the profitability of the Company would not be adversely affected during any period of changes in interest rates. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources--Hedging' and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Inflation and Interest Rates.' ABILITY TO SUSTAIN GROWTH Since January 1, 1995, the Company has expanded into new geographic regions and substantially increased its volume of loans originated and purchased. In light of such growth, the historical performance of the Company's earnings may be of limited relevance in predicting future performance. Any credit or other problems associated with the large number of loans originated and purchased in the recent past would not become apparent until sometime in the future. The Company's continued growth and expansion will place additional pressures on the Company's personnel and systems. Any future growth may be limited by, among other things, the Company's need for continued funding sources, access to capital markets, ability to retain and attract qualified personnel, sensitivity to economic slowdowns, fluctuations in interest rates and competition from other consumer finance companies and from new market entrants. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully obtain or apply the human, operational and financial resources needed to manage a developing and expanding business. Failure by the Company to manage its growth effectively, or to sustain its historical levels of performance in credit analysis and transaction structuring with respect to the increased loan origination and purchase volume, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation' and 'Business--Business Strategy.' COMPETITION As a purchaser and originator of mortgage loans, the Company faces intense competition, primarily from mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loans, credit card issuers and finance companies. Many of these competitors in the financial services business are substantially larger and have more capital and other resources than the Company. Competition can take many forms, including convenience in obtaining a loan, service, marketing and distribution channels and interest rates. Competition may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates and general economic conditions. During periods of rising rates, competitors which have 'locked in' low borrowing costs may have a competitive advantage. During periods of declining rates, competitors may solicit the Company's borrowers to refinance their loans. During economic slowdowns or recessions, the Company's borrowers may have new financial difficulties and may be receptive to offers by the Company's competitorsFurthermore, the current level of gains realized by the Company and its competitors on the sale of the type of loans purchased and originated is attracting additional competitors into this market with the effect of lowering the gains that may be realized by the Company on future loan sales. In addition, greater investor acceptance of securities backed by loans comparable to the Company's mortgage loans and greater availability of information regarding the prepayment and default experience of such loans creates greater efficiencies in the market for such securities. Such efficiencies may create a desire for even larger transactions giving companies with greater volumes of originations a competitive advantage. In addition, a more efficient market for such securities may lead certain investors to purchase securities backed by other types of assets where potential returns may be greater. Furthermore, certain large national finance companies and conforming mortgage originators have announced their intention to adapt their conforming origination programs and allocate resources to the origination of non-conforming loans. In addition, certain of these larger mortgage companies, commercial banks and savings and loans have begun to offer products similar to those offered by the Company, targeting customers similar to those of the Company. The entrance of these competitors into the Company's market could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. See 'Business--Competition.' DEPENDENCE ON BROKERS AND CORRESPONDENTS The Company depends on brokers and correspondents for its originations and purchases of new loans. None of these brokers or correspondents is contractually obligated to do business with the Company. Further, the Company's competitors also have relationships with the Company's brokers and correspondents and actively 11 compete with the Company in its efforts to expand its broker and correspondent networks. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining its existing relationships or expanding its broker and correspondent networks. The Company originated and purchased loans in the twelve month period ended June 30, 1996 from a network of 806 brokers and 186 correspondents. However, the top 20 brokers and correspondents and the top broker accounted for approximately 48.7% and 12.6%, respectively, of the total volume of loans originated and purchased during the six months ended June 30, 1996. Accordingly, the loss of a significant number of any of these brokers or correspondents could have a material adverse impact on the volume of loan originations and purchases and a resulting material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. See 'Business--Loans.' CONTINGENT RISKS Although the Company sells substantially all of the loans that it purchases and originates on a nonrecourse basis, the Company retains some degree of credit risk on all loans purchased or originated. During the period of time that loans are held pending sale, the Company is subject to the various business risks associated with lending, including the risk of borrower default, the risk of foreclosure and the risk that an increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the value of loans to potential purchasers. The Company's securitizations require the use of Excess Servicing to reduce the principal balances of the related investor certificates up to a specified amount. The resulting over-collateralization amounts serve as credit enhancement for the related trust and therefore are available to absorb losses realized on loans held by such trust. Although there is no direct recourse to the Company for losses on securitized loans, the use of the Excess Servicing to provide additional over-collateralization as a form of credit enhancement may reduce the value of residual and interest-only certificates carried on the Company's balance sheet. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' In addition, agreements governing securitizations, including the Company's securitizations, require the seller to commit to repurchase or replace loans that do not conform to the representations and warranties made by the seller at the time of sale. When borrowers are delinquent in making monthly payments on loans included in a securitization, the Company is required to advance interest payments with respect to such delinquent loans to the extent that the Company deems such advances ultimately recoverable. These advances require funding from the Company's capital resources but have priority of repayment from the succeeding month's collections. As of June 30, 1996, such advances totaled $6.3 million. Prior to 1991, the Company combined mortgage loans into pools and sold these pools as well as individual mortgage loans directly to a network of commercial banks, savings and loans, insurance companies, pension funds and accredited investors. The Company generally sold these pools or individual loans with recourse whereby the Company is obligated to repurchase any loan which defaults and the related mortgaged property becomes an REO (real estate owned) property. This obligation is subject to various terms and conditions, including, in some instances, a time limit. At June 30, 1996, $22.9 million or 3.7% of the Company's $624.1 million servicing portfolio was subject to be repurchased in the future should such loans become REO properties. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is subject to claims made against it by borrowers and private investors arising from, among other things, losses that are claimed to have been incurred as a result of alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations, misrepresentations, errors and omissions of employees, officers and agents of the Company (including its appraisers), incomplete documentation and failures by the Company to comply with various laws and regulations applicable to its business. The Company believes that the liability with respect to any currently asserted claims or legal actions is not likely to be material to the Company's results of operations or financial condition; however, any claims asserted in the future may result in legal expenses or liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial conditionCONCENTRATION OF OPERATIONS For the six months ended June 30, 1996, 91.9% of the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans purchased or originated by the Company were secured by properties located in 10 states, with New York and New Jersey accounting for 68.9% of those total originations and purchases. Although the Company continues to 12 expand its mortgage origination network in other regions of the country, the Company's origination business is likely to remain concentrated in the Northeast for the foreseeable future. Consequently, the Company's results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon general trends in the economy and the residential real estate market in the Northeast. See 'Business--Loans.' CREDIT-IMPAIRED BORROWERS The Company targets credit-impaired borrowers. Loans made to such borrowers generally entail a higher risk of delinquency and possibly higher losses than loans made to more creditworthy borrowers. No assurance can be given that the Company's underwriting policies and collection procedures will alleviate such risks. In the event that pools of loans warehoused, sold and serviced by the Company experience higher delinquencies, foreclosures or losses than anticipated, the Company's results of operations or financial condition would be adversely affected. See 'Business--Loans.' LOSS OF SERVICING RIGHTS AND SUSPENSION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS The Company's right to act as servicer under its securitizations can be terminated under certain circumstances by the trustee or insurer of a particular securitization. Such events include among other things: (i) failure by the Company to pay when due any amount payable under the pooling and servicing agreement governing that securitization, (ii) failure of the Company to satisfy certain financial tests, including a minimum net worth test, and (iii) the loss and delinquency performance of the mortgage loans in the securitization exceeding certain levels. Under some of the Company's servicing agreements, a failure by the Miller family to continue to own, directly or indirectly, a majority of the Company's outstanding voting stock, may result in a termination event. Any termination of the Company's right to act as servicer under a securitization would materially and adversely affect its ability to engage in future securitizations which and would have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. See 'Business--Loans--Loan Servicing and Collections.' LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY RISK Members of Congress and government officials from time to time have suggested the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction for federal income tax purposes, either entirely or in part, based on borrower income, type of loan or principal amount. Because many of the Company's loans are made to borrowers for the purpose of consolidating consumer debt or financing other consumer needs, the competitive advantages of tax deductible interest, when compared with alternative sources of financing, could be eliminated or seriously impaired by such government action. Accordingly, the reduction or elimination of these tax benefits could have a material adverse effect on the demand for loans of the kind offered by the Company. The Company's business is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and licensing by federal, state and local governmental authorities and is subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of its operations. The Company's consumer lending activities are subject to the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z (including the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994), the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, as amended ('ECOA'), the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1994, as amended, the Federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ('RESPA') and Regulation X, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations affecting the Company's activities. The Company is also subject to the rules and regulations of, and examinations by, the Department of Housing and Urban Development ('HUD') and state regulatory authorities with respect to originating, processing, underwriting, selling and servicing loansThese rules and regulations, among other things, impose licensing obligations on the Company, establish eligibility criteria for mortgage loans, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of properties, require credit reports on loan applicants, regulate assessment, collection, foreclosure and claims handling, investment and interest payments on escrow balances and payment features, mandate certain disclosures and notices to borrowers and, in some cases, fix maximum interest rates, fees and mortgage loan amounts. Failure to comply with these requirements can lead to loss of approved status, termination or suspension of servicing contracts without compensation to the servicer, demands for indemnifications or mortgage loan repurchases, certain rights of rescission for mortgage loans, class action lawsuits and administrative enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain compliance with 13 these requirements in the future without additional expenses, or that more restrictive local, state or federal laws, rules and regulations will not be adopted that would make compliance more difficult for the Company. See 'Business--Regulation.' DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL The Company's growth and development to date has been largely dependent upon the services of Sidney Miller, Hugh Miller and other key members of management. Although the Company has been able to hire and retain other qualified and experienced management personnel, the loss of either Sidney Miller's or Hugh Miller's services for any reason could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has entered into employment agreements with both persons, as well as with certain other members of senior management. See 'Management--Employment Agreements; Key-Man Life Insurance.' ABSENCE OF PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET AND POSSIBLE VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE Prior to the Offering, there has been no public market for the Common Stock. The Company has been approved to list the Common Stock on the NYSE, subject to notice of issuance. However, there can be no assurance that an active public trading market for the Common Stock will develop after the Offering or that, if developed, such market will be sustained. The public offering price of the Common Stock offered hereby was determined by negotiations among the Company and the representatives of the Underwriters (the 'Representatives') and may not be indicative of the price at which the Common Stock will trade after the Offering. See 'Underwriting.' Consequently, there can be no assurance that the market price for the Common Stock will not fall below the initial public offering price. The market price of the Common Stock may experience fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of the Company. In particular, the price of the Common Stock may be affected by general market price movements as well as developments specifically related to the consumer finance industry such as, among other things, interest rate movements and delinquency trends. In addition, the Company's operating income on a quarterly basis is significantly dependent upon the Company's ability to access the securitization market and complete significant securitization transactions in a particular quarter. Failure to complete securitizations in a particular quarter may have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations for that quarter and could negatively affect the price of t</td>

of our active user base. our primary means of monetizing our active user base has been our dynamic secure search solution under, until november 2010, our search agreement with yahoo! and, since its implementation in november 2010, our search agreement with google. these search agreements have provided us with a significant revenue stream. we have also generated revenue from the sale of threat-analysis data derived from online search activity. our new products and online services, in addition to helping to expand our user base, have generated revenue more directly via the sale of backup recovery cds, online backup space and extended download files for data recovery. if we cannot find additional methods of monetizing our active user base and additional products and online services that users find compelling, we will not be able to continue our recent growth and increase our revenue, margins and profitability. if our new methods of monetizing our active user base or our new products and online services cannot be sustained, our revenue, margins and profitability could recede toward those we had with our previous, subscription-based model.we must maintain our relationships with our existing users and attract new users if we are to continue to expand and improve the quality of our user base, which we may be unable to do. a significant portion of our users stop using our products in any given period because the cost of switching to the products and online services of competitors on existing hardware is minimal and because competitors products are often preinstalled on new hardware purchased by our users, among other reasons. for example, in the security software market, about 95% of new desktop computers have one of our competitors security products preinstalled. to continue to expand our user base, we must retain our existing users to the extent possible and continuously attract new users, both to replace the many users who exit our user base and to expand that base. any failure to continue to expand our user base could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. in addition, our ability to monetize our active user base varies depending on many characteristics of those users, including level of engagement with our products, amount and nature of internet and computing activities, geographic location and income level. if we are unable to retain and recruit users whose characteristics contribute 13 to a user base with optimum potential for monetization, our business, operating results and financial condition could suffer materially. the significant turnover in our user base also limits our ability to predict our revenue and cash flows for future periods, making it more difficult for us to manage our business.our search-traffic program is crucial to our effort to monetize more of our active user base and this program is vulnerable to technological change, including the rise of mobile computing, and our reliance on one search provider. our most successful program to monetize all of our active user base has been our dynamic secure search solution, including our browser toolbar, which gives our users a convenient way to access a search engine at any time and to be secure that the sites that are the results of the search will not infect or damage their computers. search engine companies pay us for the search queries we steer to them via our dynamic secure search solution. if software companies that provide internet browsers prevent the addition of our toolbar, either directly by limiting space for toolbars in the browser interface or indirectly by restricting access to software code, our ability to monetize all of our active user base will be adversely affected. the rise of mobile computing makes this risk more acute as most mobile devices have smaller screens than desktop and laptop computers and software developed for these devices may not as readily accommodate additional toolbars as software developed for desktop and laptop computers. we have not yet begun distributing our toolbar with software designed specifically for mobile devices but intend to do so in future, as mobile represents a small but expanding proportion of the total search market. in addition, we currently expect that revenue per active mobile user will be lower than revenue from traditional active users. as such, there can be no assurance that revenue from our dynamic secure search solution or other similar solutions we may develop will grow in line with our expectations, or that we will be able to maintain or expand our current and future platform-derived agreements or enter into additional agreements to generate platform-derived revenue. the failure of these markets to continue to grow would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. for the majority of platform-derived revenue from our dynamic secure search, we have relied upon agreements with one search engine company at a time, previously yahoo! and now google, to generate revenue from our dynamic secure search solution. our revenue generated by yahoo! accounted for 21.6% of our total revenue in 2010. we began to generate revenue from google sourced search in the fourth quarter of 2010 and our revenue from google sourced search accounted for less than 10% of our revenue in 2010. revenue generated by yahoo! and google sourced search accounted for less than 10% and more than 10%, respectively, of our revenue for the nine months ended september30, 2011. under our previous yahoo! contract there was a transition period, ending in may 2011, during which users of our yahoo! sourced search could continue to use yahoo! sourced search through our toolbar, thereby still generating revenue under our yahoo! contract, until they chose to switch to our google sourced search. we have revenue concentration risk as we rely on our contractual arrangement with google for a significant portion of our revenue and we cannot guarantee that the revenue generated from the google sourced search agreement will continue. furthermore, in most jurisdictions we may only use google as our search service provider. google pays us a percentage of any search revenue generated by google whenever a user clicks on an ad (also called a sponsored link) served by google and hosted on one of avgs search domains. our users can click on such ads via the toolbar, default search, address bar search or the avg search homepage. any decline in the popularity of our products or googles search engine among users could result in a decrease in revenue under this agreement. google can also unilaterally make changes to its policies and guidelines, which primarily concern the operations and technology of its search services. these changes could require us to modify or suspend certain of our activities relating to our toolbar, which could be costly for us to implement or lead to a reduction in the number of our toolbar users. we need googles permission to use the toolbar in a form other than that previously approved in connection with our initial contract with google, which, if google did not grant such permission, could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue by preventing us from using the toolbar as we otherwise could. in addition, google may terminate this agreement if the advertisement revenue generated through our dynamic secure search solution falls below a certain amount for a period of three months and has other customary termination rights under the agreement, including upon a change of control. the agreement expires on september30, 2012, and google is under no 14 obligation to renew this agreement. if, upon the termination or expiration of our agreement with google, we fail to enter into a new agreement with google or a similar search provider on substantially the same or more favorable terms, our revenue would significantly decrease.if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand, our business and operating results may be harmed. we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand identity is critical to our business. the successful promotion of our brand will depend largely upon our marketing and public relations efforts, the quality of our internet security solutions and our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. the promotion of our brand may require us to make substantial expenditures, which will likely increase as our market becomes more competitive and as we expand into new markets. if we are not successful at maintaining and enhancing our brand, our ability to attract new users would be adversely affected and we could lose users, third-party distributors and resellers. our business depends on our brand recognition and the failure to maintain or enhance our brand image could adversely affect our business and market position. in particular, we rely on our active users as primary drivers of our user-driven marketing strategy and any negative change to the perception of our brand among our active users could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our solutions, as well as those of our competitors. perception of our products in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. our brand could be harmed if industry analysts provide negative reviews of our security software solutions or our company. furthermore, we depend upon certain third-party distributors of our solutions and actions by those third parties could have a negative effect on our brand.we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and online services as a result of numerous factors, most of which are beyond our control. demand for our products and online services fluctuates from period to period due to factors such as general economic conditions, competition, product obsolescence, technological change, shifts in buying patterns, financial and business conditions of our current and potential customers and levels of internet usage. there are also particular factors driving demand for each of our specific products and online services. for instance, demand for our internet security solutions among our targeted customer base of small businesses and consumers is driven by our small business customers need for protection of business-critical data, consumers need for protection of their own personal data, potential users awareness of internet security threats (including cybercrime) generally, the perceived potential damage caused by information loss and other factors. most of these factors are beyond our control. a change in the factors driving demand for our products and online services generally or for particular products and online services could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.any failure or perceived failure to anticipate, prepare for and respond promptly to technological developments and the changing nature of online security threats could harm our competitive position and business prospects. the needs of our customers and the threats they face evolve constantly. for example, in the endpoint security market, hackers and cybercriminals continuously develop and employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to penetrate systems and networks and access information. although the market expects timely introduction of software solutions to respond to new threats, the development of these solutions can be challenging and time-consuming. we may experience delays in the introduction of new solutions, updates, enhancements and features. if we fail or are perceived to fail to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our users by developing and introducing on a timely basis internet security solutions that effectively protect against new security threats, our competitive position, reputation and business prospects could be harmed. 15 similarly, the endpoint security market is dynamic, characterized by new technologies and access points to the internet, which also require protection from hackers and cybercriminal attacks. responding to the challenges posed by these new platforms and their corresponding new threats can be difficult and require significant reengineering of our software. we may therefore fail or be perceived to fail to provide solutions for these new technology platforms as threats to them arise, which could harm our competitive position, reputation and business prospects and would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.if our upgrades and new products and online services, whether acquired or internally developed, fail to achieve widespread market acceptance, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed. our ability to attract new users and to maintain or increase revenue from existing users depends largely upon our ability to continue providing competitive new products and enhanced solutions that meet the changing needs of our target user base as these needs arise. we plan to continue to invest in acquisitions, research and development, marketing, promotion and sales of our products and online services, with new features, functionalities, enhancements and upgrades. acquisition of new companies and products creates integration risk, while development of upgrades and new products and online services involves significant time, labor and expense and is subject to risks and challenges including management of the length of the development cycle, adaptation to evolving industry standards, entry into new markets, integration into our existing product line, regulatory compliance, evolution in sales methods and acquisition and maintenance of intellectual property rights. if we fail to launch these upgrades or new solutions on time, or they do not achieve widespread market acceptance, do not meet user expectations, do not operate in an efficient manner, otherwise create the perception of slow operating performance, or generate revenue that is not sufficient to recoup or justify the cost of development, our revenue, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.a significant percentage of our total revenue comes from purchases of subscriptions to our premium products, which must by their terms be renewed by our users to remain in force. historically, a significant majority of our active users have been users of our free products and online services. our growth strategy is based in part on offering premium products on top of our core, free products. to the extent we are not able to convert these free users into subscription users, our ability to generate subscription revenue would be adversely affected. we generally provide our premium internet security solutions pursuant to one-year and two-year subscriptions, after which the relevant product or services either cease to operate or are no longer updated with the latest online threat information (rendering the product increasingly less useful as new threats emerge). in 2010, subscription revenue accounted for 76.8% of our total revenue, and in the nine months ended september30, 2011, subscription revenue accounted for 65.7% of our total revenue. while we offer subscription users the option to renew their subscriptions, a significant portion of our subscription users choose not to do so. we have taken steps to increase our renewal rates by, for example, adding an auto-renew option on our premium products and online services, but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in increasing our renewal rates. approximately 18% of users purchasing a license online in 2010 and 30.9% of those purchasing a license online in the nine months ended september30, 2011 opted for auto-renewal. the european union is developing a new eu consumer rights directive, however, that is scheduled to come into effect in 2013 that will restrict the use of auto-renewals if the directive is enacted in its current form. we may consequently be forced to reduce or eliminate our use of auto-renewals with subscription users in the european union once these rules go into effect. proposals to restrict auto-renewals are also under consideration in the united states. to the extent that we must reduce or eliminate use of auto-renewals in these or other markets, our renewal rates may fall, potentially reducing the number of our subscription users. as a consequence, the growth of our subscription revenue depends significantly on attracting new subscription users, and this dependence could increase due to regulations concerning auto-renewal that are outside of our control. any failure to maintain or improve the renewal rates of our subscription users or to attract new subscription users could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 16 furthermore, our ability to measure the conversion of free users into subscription users is limited as there are multiple upgrade paths to our premium products and online services, not all of which we are currently able to track or track accurately. if we are unable to effectively track changes in conversion rates, regardless of the reason for such changes, we may be unable to react to changing market dynamics, and this may negatively affect our growth and revenue. uncertainty about the renewal rates of our subscription users also limits visibility with respect to future subscription revenue.we operate in highly competitive markets and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. the markets for the software solutions we offer are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes as customers needs and the threats they face evolve. we expect competition to increase in the future and we may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors. in particular, some of our competitors may make acquisitions or enter into agreements or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive products and/or services, and new competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, agreements or strategic or other such relationships. we and other vendors compete on price and functionality at different price points. additional competition may cause increased pricing pressure, which could reduce our revenue per user. for example, in the endpoint security software market, while we have historically been able to reduce pricing pressure on our premium solutions and limit the decline in revenue per subscription user by releasing regular product enhancements, there can be no assurance that pricing pressure will not adversely affect our subscription revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. similarly, across our markets, our competitors may offer free products perceived to be superior to our offerings, causing our free and/or subscription users to switch and shrinking our monetizeable user base. our main competitors fall into the following categories: vendors with freemium pricing like our own, such as avast!, avira, pc tools (which was acquired by symantec), carbonite and dropbox; traditional vendors such as mcafee (which was acquired by intel corporation), symantec and trend micro (which primarily provide software solutions, including security software, for large enterprises) and eset, kaspersky labs, panda software, sophos, rising, kingsoft, check point and f-secure (which offer more customized and segment-focused products); vendors offering tune-up products, such as uniblue; and large corporations offering a wide variety of products, only a few of which compete with ours, such as microsoft, google, which recently introduced free security software solutions, apple, which offers cloud-based data protection, qihoo, tencent and facebook. many of these competitors have significantly greater brand name recognition and financial resources to devote to the development, promotion and sale of their products and/or services than we do. for example, microsoft entered the endpoint security market through the introduction of microsoft security essentials, a free internet security product that has captured a significant share of the free endpoint security market. similarly, google, our primary provider for our search revenue stream, recently entered the security space by adding a malware alarm to its search engine results display and it may increase its security offerings in future. further, smaller and/or more regionally focused vendors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demand as recently evidenced by the rapid growth of internet companies like qihoo and tencent. software vendors have begun to employ a cloud-based or software-as-a-service business model in which vendors host applications for use by customers over the internet. this model may disrupt existing models like the 17 model we employ for most of our products and online services, based on software downloaded from the internet that resides on a users hard drive. our competitors, including new cloud-based entrants or larger competitors with greater resources to shift to a new model, may have success with cloud-based provision of software, decreasing the demand for those of our products based on another model. in the future, we may face competition from both emerging and established companies operating in our sector and in other areas of the it business that may develop or acquire security software that they may offer as part of their broader product or service offerings and/or for free. original equipment manufacturers, or oems, or operating system vendors may seek to include pre-installed, fully functional internet security solutions with their core product offering. for example, intel acquired mcafee, one of our leading competitors, and has indicated its intention to integrate mcafees security solutions into its hardware products, which may adversely affect sales of our aftermarket and/or standalone security solutions. intel is one of the worlds largest semiconductor chip manufacturers and its investment division has been a shareholder in avg since 2005. intels shares are held through one of its indirect subsidiaries, intel capital (cayman) corporation, or intel capital, and it will hold 11.9% of the issued share capital in avg following the completion of this offering, assuming no exercise of the overallotment option. intel capital and avg agreed on measures to address competitive concerns arising from intels announcement of its intention to acquire mcafee, the subsequent completion of that acquisition and its continued minority ownership of avg. these include measures designed to prevent intel capital from accessing certain commercially sensitive information about avg and suspending intel capitals right to appoint a member of or have an observer on our supervisory board. upon completion of this offering, intel will have no ongoing special rights and will therefore only receive information about us at the same time and in the same fashion as our other public shareholders. accordingly, the measures agreed by intel capital and avg will terminate on completion of this offering. in addition, other competitors may leverage their greater resources to develop relationships with oems or operating system vendors, thereby diminishing demand for our products and adversely affecting our ability to acquire and retain customers.our failure to adequately protect our users personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business. a wide variety of provincial, state, national and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. these data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and prospects. evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information, both within the european union and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of ip addresses, machine identification, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our solutions by current and future customers. we are subject to privacy laws, which have become increasingly stringent. we collect and process personal data (including email addresses, ip addresses, customer satisfaction data, physical names and addresses, customer service issues and website visits) as part of our business and part of our strategy for future growth involves greater interaction with our customer base. in addition, a majority of our online customers purchase our services online with a credit card. as a result, we must comply with strict data protection and privacy laws in the european union, the united states and certain other jurisdictions where we operate, as well as data protection and documentation standards adopted by credit card issuers. those laws and standards regulate and restrict our ability to collect and use personal information relating to customers and potential customers. 18 there have been significant developments in the laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, including in relation to the use of cookies and the solicitation, collection, processing or other use of personal data, including data relating to consumers. furthermore, the proposed u.s. do not track law would allow users to opt out of online monitoring and would thereby block even monitoring conducted with benign intent, such as monitoring to increase the efficacy of security software. additionally, efforts in the united states to propose a privacy bill of rights could lead to legislation that would require us to adopt additional security measures or prevent us from retaining or using certain data. such regulation could affect our ability to execute our strategy of building additional commercial partnerships, as the sharing of customer data needed to derive value from those partnerships may be prohibited by regulation. any present or future laws which restrict the collection and use of personal data could have a material adverse effect on our business. the requirements imposed by data protection laws and regulations can conflict with laws, and the demands of regulators and other governmental authorities, in foreign jurisdictions. for example, u.s. authorities can demand access to data that is accessible by our group companies that are located in the united states, pursuant to the usa patriot act. if any of that data includes personal data, it is possible that any such disclosure could cause us to breach data protection laws and regulations in one or more member states of the european union. our data security defenses could be breached. notwithstanding our efforts to secure our it, data security and other systems, we are exposed to the risk that this data could be wrongfully accessed or used, whether by employees, customers or other third parties, or otherwise lost or disclosed or processed in a manner that violates applicable data protection law and regulation. in certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are under an affirmative legal obligation to notify the appropriate government authorities or data subjects in circumstances where personal data may have been wrongly accessed or used, or otherwise lost or disclosed. efforts to mitigate and comply with such laws, and even the perception of a data security breach, increase the risk that such incidents will lead to sanctions (including fines and other penalties), claims by data subjects and disclosure leading to public knowledge of the breach, potentially causing reputational damage to our business.regulation of the internet and the lack of certainty regarding application of existing laws to the internet could substantially harm our operating results and business. we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to doing business on the internet. it is often not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the internet as these laws have in some cases failed to keep pace with technological change. recently enacted laws governing the internet could also impact our business. for instance, existing and future regulations on taxing internet use or restricting the exchange of information over the internet could result in reduced growth or a decline in the use of the internet and could diminish the viability of our services. in particular, the european union has approved rules that will come into effect in 2013, and the united states is considering similar proposals, to restrict the use of automatic renewals, which may reduce the renewal rate of and subscription revenue for our premium products. furthermore, it is possible that governments of one or more countries may censor, limit or block certain users access to our websites. changing industry standards and industry self-regulation regarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain data may have similar effects. any such adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our operating results and our business. we believe that we and our resellers have sold or provided our products to users in jurisdictions that are the subject of export controls and sanctions administered by the u.s. commerce departments bureau of industry and security and the u.s. treasury departments office of foreign assets control.we believe that we may have inadvertently violated certain of these controls and sanctions in the past. we cannot currently assess the nature and extent of fines or other penalties, if any, that the bureau of industry and security or other u.s. governmental agencies may impose against us or our employees for any such violations. sale of certain of our products into cuba, iran, north korea, sudan and syria may be restricted or prohibited under u.s. export control laws and/or economic sanctions administered by the u.s. commerce departments bureau of industry and security, or bis, and the u.s. treasury departments office of foreign assets control, or ofac. we have discovered that, from time to time, we have sold

        <td class="fillremaining">RISK FACTORS Prospective purchasers of the Preferred Securities offered hereby should consider carefully the factors set forth below, as well as other information set forth in this Prospectus, in evaluating an investment in the Preferred Securities SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION; CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES The apparel industry is highly competitive. Certain of the Company's competitors are significantly larger and more diversified than the Company and have substantially greater resources. The apparel industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variations, and a recession in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. The Company believes that its success depends in large part upon its ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner and upon the continued appeal to consumers of the images projected by Calvin Klein and, in the future, Donna Karan. Failure by the Company to identify and respond appropriately to changing consumer demands and fashion trends or a decline in consumer demand for designer-labeled products could adversely affect consumer acceptance of its products and may have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company believes that the DKNY Jeans License recently entered into will permit it to diversify its products because the DKNY Jeans Label products are expected to appeal to different target consumers than those who typically purchase Calvin Klein Jeans Label productsHowever, it is possible that the DKNY Jeans Label products and the Calvin Klein Jeans Label products could compete with each other and limit the overall growth of net revenues of the Company DEPENDENCE ON LICENSES The Company's recent growth has depended upon the sale of Calvin Klein Jeans Label products under the CKJ License. The Company's future growth will depend upon continuing sales of Calvin Klein Jeans Label products as well as the successful launch of DKNY Jeans Label products under the new DKNY Jeans LicenseEach of the CKJ License and the DKNY Jeans License contain provisions that, under certain circumstances, could permit the respective licensor to terminate its license. Such provisions include, among other things, (i) a default in the payment of certain amounts payable under the applicable license that continues beyond the specified grace period and (ii) the failure to comply with the covenants contained in the applicable license. The Company believes that it is currently in compliance with all material provisions of the CKJ License and has no reason to believe that any events are likely to occur that would permit CKI to terminate the CKJ License. In addition, under each of the applicable licenses, the respective licensor has retained the right to produce, distribute, advertise and sell, and to authorize others to produce, distribute, advertise and sell, certain garments (in the case of CKI, not of jeans-type construction) that are similar to some of the Company's products. The Company believes that any production, distribution, advertisement or sale of such garments by such licensor or another authorized party would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, although there can be no assurance to that effect. See "Business -- CKJ License" and "-- DKNY Jeans License." ABILITY TO ACHIEVE AND MANAGE FUTURE GROWTH In 1993, the year before the Company obtained the CKJ License, net revenues from the sale of Calvin Klein Jeans Label products by CKI were approximately $59 million. Since the Company obtained the CKJ License in August 1994, net revenues (including royalties) of Calvin Klein Jeans Label products increased substantially and were $361.4 million in 1995 and $218.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 1996. No assurance can be given that the rate of growth of net sales will not decline or that the Company will be successful in increasing net sales in the future. In addition, the Company only recently entered into the DKNY Jeans License. The Company has not yet implemented its strategic business plan for this transaction, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to execute its business plan or that such plan will lead to increased net revenues. Furthermore, the Company expects to incur approximately $15 million to begin merchandising, marketing and advertising the DKNY Jeans Label products, a substantial portion of which is expected to be incurred in advance of the receipt of any sales revenues. These advance payments will 15 16 adversely affect the results of operations of the Company for the periods in which the costs are incurred. See "Use of Proceeds" and "Business -- DKNY Jeans License." In order to manage anticipated levels of demand for its products including the successful implementation of operations of the DKNY Jeans License, the Company will be required to continue to (i) expand its distribution capabilities, (ii) develop its financial management systems and controls, including inventory management, and (iii) attract and retain qualified personnel, including middle management. In particular, the Company will need to develop a management team for the merchandising, marketing and other operations of the DKNY Jeans License. As sales increased significantly since January 1, 1995, the Company experienced difficulties in meeting the increased demands on its distribution systems. The Company responded by expanding and improving its distribution facilities and implementing improved management information systems. The Company believes that its current distribution facilities and management information systems are sufficient for its current level of operations and, together with planned expansions and improvements, will be sufficient for anticipated growth in demand for the Company's products. Any disruption or slow down in the Company's order processing and fulfillment systems could cause orders to be shipped late, and under industry practices, retailers can cancel orders and refuse to receive goods on account of late shipment. Such cancellation of orders and returns of refused goods can mean a reduction of revenue, increased administrative and shipping costs, a further burden on the Company's distribution capacity and added costs associated with liquidating inventory out of season. There can be no assurance that the planned expansions and improvements will be completed as planned or that when completed the distribution facilities and systems will function as anticipated. In addition, failure to continue to enhance operating control systems, or unexpected difficulties encountered during expansion, could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company could also experience some delays in connection with the introduction of new products, as such products, including DKNY Jeans Label products, are integrated into the Company's operationsDEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL The continued success of the Company currently depends, to a significant extent, on the abilities and continued service of a small group of key management executives, in particular, Mr. Arnold Simon, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Simon's employment agreement with the Company expires December 31, 1998. See "Management -- Employment Agreements." Mr. Simon, through his ownership interest in the Principal Stockholder, is also the beneficial owner of a substantial portion of the Common Stock of the Company. See "Principal Stockholders." The Company maintains a $10 million key man life insurance policy on Mr. Simon, which has been assigned to The CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc. ("The CIT Group") pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement (as defined in "Use of Proceeds"). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain the services of such executives, and the loss of the services of Mr. Simon or certain other key executives could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, financial condition and results of operationsDEPENDENCE ON MANUFACTURERS Substantially all of the Company's products are manufactured by third parties. The Company's three largest suppliers, Azteca Productions, Inc. ("Azteca"), Koos Manufacturing, Inc. and Nemanco Inc., accounted for approximately 52% of the Company's finished goods purchased during the six months ended June 30, 1996. The Company is the principal customer of each of these suppliers, and the Company's relationship with these suppliers dates back several years. The Company believes that such relationships provide a significant competitive advantage to the Company. Although the Company believes that it could find alternative manufacturing sources, establishment of new manufacturing relationships could involve various uncertainties and disruptions, and the loss of a substantial portion of such manufacturing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company continually explores the availability and feasibility of alternative locations around the world to manufacture its products. The inability of a manufacturer to ship products in a timely manner or to meet the Company's quality standards could adversely affect the Company's ability to deliver products in a timely manner. From time to time, the Company has experienced delays in shipments from suppliers in the ordinary course of 16 17 operations, but none of such delays has had a material effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. In January 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with Commerce Clothing, an affiliate of Azteca, granting the right to source and distribute Calvin Klein Jeans Label products for children in the United States as well as the Bill Blass and Rio label products. The Company expects to enter into arrangements with both the principal manufacturers named above and additional manufacturers for the manufacture of DKNY Jeans Label products. The Company has not yet identified these new manufacturers; however, it does not anticipate any significant problems in identifying such manufacturers. The failure to enter into satisfactory manufacturing arrangements or the failure of the manufacturers to deliver quality products in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on the introduction of the DKNY Jeans Label products as well as on the business, financial condition and result of operations of the Company. During 1995 and the six months ended June 30, 1996, the Company imported approximately 20% and 17.5%, respectively, of the Calvin Klein Jeans Label products that it sold. Approximately 6% of the Company's Calvin Klein Jeans Label products were sourced in China (including Hong Kong) in each such periodThere was no other country that accounted for more than 3% of such products. The Company's imports are subject to bilateral textile agreements between the United States and a number of foreign countries. Such agreements, which have been negotiated under the framework established by the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles, allow the United States to impose restraints at any time on the importation of categories of merchandise that, under the terms of the agreements, are not currently subject to specific limits. The Company does not own the right to import finished garments into the United States, but it relies on its contract manufacturers and its agents to obtain the necessary quotas. In the past, to the extent that necessary import quotas have not been available with respect to a particular source of supply, the Company has been able to find an alternative source of supply. Accordingly, the availability of quotas has not had a material effect upon the Company's business, financial conditions or results of operations. The Company's continued ability to source products that it imports may be adversely affected by a significant decrease in available import quotas as well as any additional bilateral agreements and unilateral trade restrictionsCONTROL BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER The Principal Stockholder currently owns of record approximately 52.2% of the Common Stock of the Company. The Principal Stockholder is a limited liability company and its operative agreement allows the holders of ownership interests therein generally to cause the Principal Stockholder to exercise disposition rights as directed by each such holder independently with respect to such holder's allocable percentage of the shares of Common Stock of the CompanyTherefore, such persons may be deemed to be the beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock of the Company. Through their ownership interests in the Principal Stockholder, Charterhouse and Mr. Simon are deemed to own beneficially approximately 25.0% and 25.2%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. See "Principal Stockholders." Upon conversion of the Convertible Debentures, the Principal Stockholder would own of record 45.0% and Charterhouse and Mr. Simon would own beneficially approximately 21.6% and 21.7%, respectively, of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company. The Principal Stockholder acting alone, and Charterhouse and Mr. Simon, acting through the Principal Stockholder, are able to elect a sufficient number of directors to control the Board of Directors and take other corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, as well as effectively control the direction and policies of the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that, in any transfer of a controlling interest in the Company, any other holders of Common Stock will be allowed to participate in any such transaction or will realize any premium with respect to their shares of Common Stock. The foregoing may have the effect of discouraging or preventing certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of the CompanyRANKING OF SUBORDINATE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE GUARANTEE AND CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES The Company's obligations under the Guarantee are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all liabilities of the Company and pari passu with the most senior preferred stock issued, from time to time, if any, by the Company. The obligations of the Company under the Convertible Debentures are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all present and future Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pari passu with 17 18 obligations to or rights of the Company's other general unsecured creditors. No payment of principal of (including redemption payments, if any), premium, if any, or interest on the Convertible Debentures may be made if (i) any Senior Indebtedness of the Company is not paid when due and any applicable grace period with respect to such default has ended with such default not having been cured or waived or ceasing to exist, or (ii) the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness has been accelerated because of a default. As of June 30, 1996, Senior Indebtedness aggregated approximately $57.1 million. In addition, because the Company's operations are conducted through its subsidiaries and the subsidiaries have not guaranteed the payment of principal of and interest on the Convertible Debentures, all liabilities of the subsidiaries, including trade payables, are effectively senior to the Convertible Debentures and the Guarantee. As of June 30, 1996, the subsidiaries had indebtedness and other liabilities of approximately $109.5 million (including the $57.1 million referred to above) outstanding. There are no terms in the Preferred Securities, the Convertible Debentures or the Guarantee that limit the Company's or any subsidiary's ability to incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness that ranks senior to the Convertible Debentures and the Guarantee. See "Description of the Guarantee -- Status of the Guarantee; Subordination" and "Description of the Convertible Debentures." HOLDING COMPANY STRUCTURE, SUBORDINATION AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS The ability of the Trust to pay amounts due on the Preferred Securities is wholly dependent upon the Company making payments on the Convertible DebenturesSince the Company is a holding company whose operations are conducted through its subsidiaries, the ability of the Company to pay interest and principal on the Convertible Debentures, and, therefore, for the Trust to make distributions and other payments on the Preferred Securities, will be dependent on the subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to the Company. Because the subsidiaries do not guarantee the payment of principal of and interest on the Convertible Debentures, claims of holders of the Preferred Securities effectively will be subordinate to the claims of creditors of the subsidiaries, including trade creditors. See "-- Ranking of Subordinate Obligations Under the Guarantee and Convertible Debentures." The ability of the Company's subsidiaries to pay dividends, as well as repay debt, is restricted by the provisions of the Credit Agreement (as defined under "Use of Proceeds") and is dependent on the Company's financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond its controlThere can be no assurance that financial results that comply with the restrictive covenants and financial tests in the Credit Agreement will be achieved. The Company has amended the Credit Agreement to permit the payment of regularly scheduled distributions on the Preferred Securities so long as there is no event of default under the Credit Agreement. See "Use of Proceeds" and "Description of Certain Indebtedness." RIGHTS UNDER THE GUARANTEE The Guarantee will be qualified as an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"). The Guarantee Trustee (as defined herein) will act as indenture trustee under the Guarantee for the purposes of compliance with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. The Guarantee Trustee will hold the Guarantee for the benefit of the holders of the Preferred Securities. The Guarantee guarantees to the holders of the Preferred Securities the payment of (i) any accrued and unpaid distributions that are required to be paid on the Preferred Securities, to the extent the Trust has funds available therefor, (ii) the Redemption Price, including all accrued and unpaid distributions with respect to Preferred Securities called for redemption by the Trust, to the extent the Trust has funds available therefor, and (iii) upon a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust (other than in connection with the distribution of Convertible Debentures to the holders of Preferred Securities or a redemption of all the Preferred Securities), the lesser of (a) the aggregate of the liquidation amount and all accrued and unpaid distributions on the Preferred Securities to the date of the payment, to the extent the Trust has funds available therefor, or (b) the amount of assets of the Trust remaining available for distribution to holders of the Preferred Securities in liquidation of the Trust. The holders of a majority in liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Guarantee Trustee or to direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Guarantee Trustee under the Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company 18 19 has failed to make a payment under the Guarantee, any holder of Preferred Securities may directly institute a legal proceeding against the Company to enforce its rights under the Guarantee without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Trust, the Guarantee Trustee or any other person or entity. If the Company were to default on its obligation to pay amounts payable on the Convertible Debentures, the Trust would lack available funds for the payment of distributions or amounts payable on redemption of the Preferred Securities or otherwise, and, in such event, holders of the Preferred Securities would not be able to rely upon the Guarantee for payment of such amountsInstead, holders of the Preferred Securities would rely on the enforcement by (i) the Property Trustee of its rights as registered holder of the Convertible Debentures against the Company pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Debentures or (ii) such holder of its right against the Company under certain circumstances to enforce payments on the Convertible Debentures. See "-- Enforcement of Certain Rights by Holders of Preferred Securities," "Description of the Guarantee" and "Description of the Convertible Debentures." The Declaration provides that each holder of Preferred Securities, by acceptance thereof, agrees to the provisions of the Guarantee, including the subordination provisions thereof, and the IndentureENFORCEMENT OF CERTAIN RIGHTS BY HOLDERS OF PREFERRED SECURITIES If a Declaration Event of Default (as defined herein) occurs and is continuing, then the holders of Preferred Securities would rely on the enforcement by the Property Trustee of its rights as a holder of the Convertible Debentures against the Company. In addition, the holders of a majority in liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee or to direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under the Declaration, including the right to direct the Property Trustee to exercise the remedies available to it as a holder of the Convertible Debentures. If the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Convertible Debentures, any holder of Preferred Securities may directly institute a legal proceeding against the Company to enforce the Property Trustee's rights under the Convertible Debentures without first instituting any legal proceeding against the Property Trustee or any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Declaration Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Company to pay interest or principal on the Convertible Debentures on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a holder of Preferred Securities may directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder of the principal of or interest on the Convertible Debentures having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities of such holder (a "Direct Action") on or after the respective due date specified in the Convertible Debentures. In connection with such Direct Action, the Company will be subrogated to the rights of such holder of Preferred Securities under the Declaration to the extent of any payment made by the Company to such holder of Preferred Securities in such Direct Action. The holders of Preferred Securities will not be able to exercise directly any other remedy available to the holders of the Convertible Debentures. The Indenture provides that the Indenture Trustee (as defined herein) shall give holders of the Convertible Debentures notice of all uncured defaults or events of default within 30 days after occurrence. However, except in the case of a default or an event of default in payment on the Convertible Debentures, the Indenture Trustee (as defined herein) is protected in withholding such notice if its officers or directors in good faith determine that withholding of such notice is in the interest of the holdersOPTION TO EXTEND INTEREST PAYMENT PERIODS The Company has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Convertible Debentures by extending the interest payment period at any time, and from time to time, on the Convertible Debentures. In addition, the lenders under the Credit Agreement have the right to require the Company to elect an Extension Period upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, whether or not the lenders have caused the indebtedness thereunder to be accelerated. As a consequence of such an extension, quarterly distributions on the Preferred Securities would be deferred (but despite such deferral would continue to accrue interest thereon, compounded quarterly) by the Trust during any such extended interest payment period. Such right to extend the interest payment period for the Convertible Debentures is limited to a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters, during which no interest shall be due and payable, provided, that no such Extension Period may extend beyond the maturity date of the Convertible Debentures. 19 20 In the event that the Company exercises this right to defer interest payments, the Company has agreed, among other things, (a) not to declare or pay dividends on, or make a distribution with respect to, or redeem or purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock (other than (i) purchases or acquisitions of shares of Common Stock in connection with the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations under any employee benefit plans or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security requiring the Company to purchase shares of Common Stock, (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's capital stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's capital stock for another class or series of the Company's capital stock or (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged (or make any guarantee payments with respect to the foregoing)), (b) not to make any payment of interest, principal or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities (including guarantees) issued by the Company that rank pari passu with or junior to the Convertible Debentures and (c) not to make any guarantee payments with respect to the foregoing (other than pursuant to the Guarantee). Prior to the termination of any such extension period, the Company may further extend the interest payment period; provided, that such Extension Period, together with all such previous and further extensions thereof, may not exceed 20 consecutive quarters or extend beyond the maturity date of the Convertible Debenture. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Company may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. See "Description of the Preferred Securities -- Distributions" and "Description of the Convertible Debentures -- Option to Extend Interest Payment Periods." Should the Company exercise its right to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period, each holder of Preferred Securities will continue to accrue income (as original issue discount ("OID")) in respect of the deferred interest allocable to its Preferred Securities for federal income tax purposes, which will be allocated but not distributed, to holders of record of Preferred Securities. As a result, each such holder of Preferred Securities will recognize income for federal income tax purposes in advance of the receipt of cash and will not receive the cash from the Trust related to such income if such holder disposes of its Preferred Securities prior to the record date for the date on which distributions of such amounts are made. The Company has no current intention of exercising its right to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period on the Convertible Debentures. However, should the Company determine to exercise such right in the future, the market price of the Preferred Securities is likely to be affected. A holder that disposes of its Preferred Securities during an Extension Period, therefore, might not receive the same return on its investment as a holder that continues to hold its Preferred Securities. In addition, as a result of the existence of the Company's right to defer interest payments, the market price of the Preferred Securities (which represent an undivided beneficial interest in the Convertible Debentures) may be more volatile than other securities on which OID accrues that do not have such rights. See "United States Federal Income Taxation -- Original Issue Discount." SPECIAL EVENT REDEMPTION OR DISTRIBUTION Upon the occurrence of a Special Event (as defined herein), the Trust shall be dissolved, except in the limited circumstance described below, with the result that the Convertible Debentures would be distributed to the holders of the Trust Securities in connection with the liquidation of the Trust. In the case of a Special Event that is a Tax Event, in certain circumstances, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Convertible Debentures, in whole or in part, in lieu of a distribution of the Convertible Debentures by the Trust, in which event the Trust will redeem the Trust Securities on a pro rata basis to the same extent as the Convertible Debentures are redeemed by the Company. See "Description of the Preferred Securities -- Special Event Redemption or Distribution." Under current federal income tax law, a distribution of Convertible Debentures upon the dissolution of the Trust would not be a taxable event to holders of the Preferred Securities. Upon occurrence of a Special Event, however, a dissolution of the Trust in which holders of the Preferred Securities receive cash would be a taxable event to such holders. See "United States Federal Income Taxation -- Receipt of Convertible Debentures or Cash Upon Liquidation of the Trust." 20 21 There can be no assurance as to the market prices for the Preferred Securities or the Convertible Debentures that may be distributed in exchange for Preferred Securities if a dissolution or liquidation of the Trust were to occurAccordingly, the Preferred Securities that an investor may purchase, whether pursuant to the offer made hereby or in the secondary market, or the Convertible Debentures that a holder of Preferred Securities may receive on dissolution and liquidation of the Trust, may trade at a discount to the price that the investor paid to purchase the Preferred Securities offered hereby. Because holders of Preferred Securities may receive Convertible Debentures upon the occurrence of a Special Event, prospective purchasers of Preferred Securities are also making an investment decision with regard to the Convertible Debentures and should carefully review all the information regarding the Convertible Debentures contained in this Prospectus. See "Description of the Preferred Securities -- Special Event Redemption or Distribution." PROPOSED TAX LEGISLATION On March 19, 1996, the U.S. Treasury Department proposed certain tax law changes (the "Proposed Legislation") that would, among other things, generally deny corporate issuers a deduction for interest in respect of certain debt obligations, with a maximum term of more than 20 years, that are not shown as indebtedness on the consolidated balance sheet of the issuer. On March 29, 1996, Senate Finance Committee Chairman William V. Roth, Jr. and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer issued a joint statement (the "Joint Statement") indicating their intent that the Proposed Legislation, if adopted by either of the tax-writing committees of Congress, would have an effective date that is no earlier than the date of "appropriate Congressional action." Based upon the Joint Statement, it is expected that if the Proposed Legislation were to be enacted, such legislation would not apply to the Convertible Debentures because they will be issued prior to the date of any "appropriate Congressional action." There can be no assurance, however, that any proposed legislation enacted after the date hereof will not otherwise adversely affect the ability of the Company to deduct the interest payable on the Convertible Debentures. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a Tax Event will not occur. See "Description of the Preferred Securities -- Special Event Redemption or Distribution."

In addition to the other information in this Prospectus, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company and its business before purchasing shares of the Common Stock offered hereby. UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH XENOMOUSE TECHNOLOGY The Company's XenoMouse technology is a new approach to the generation and development of antibody therapeutic products. To date, the Company has not commercialized any antibody products based on its XenoMouse technology. In addition, the Company is not aware of any commercialized antibody therapeutic product that has been generated or developed from any transgenic technologies. Current antibody product candidates based on, utilizing or derived from XenoMouse technology are at a very early stage of development. To date, the Company has begun clinical trials with respect to only one such antibody product candidate. While to date XenoMouse technology has been able to generate antibodies against the antigens to which it had been exposed, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so with respect to all future antigens. Failure of the Company's XenoMouse technology to generate antibody product candidates that lead to the successful development and commercialization of products would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Although the Company believes that its XenoMouse technology offers certain advantages, there can be no assurance that these advantages will be realized or, if realized, that XenoMouse technology will result in any meaningful benefits to current or potential collaborative partners or patients. There can be no assurance that the Company's XenoMouse technology will enable the Company or any of its collaborative partners to identify, generate, develop or commercialize antibody therapeutic products or product candidates in an efficient and timely manner, if at all. See "Business -- The Abgenix Solution -- XenoMouse Technology." EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT; HISTORY OF LOSSES AND UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE PROFITABILITY The Company is at an early stage of development and must be evaluated in light of the uncertainties and complexities present in an early stage biopharmaceutical company. The product candidates under development by the Company are in the research or preclinical development stage or are in the early stage of clinical trials. Significant investment in additional research and development, preclinical and clinical testing, regulatory and sales and marketing activities will be necessary in order for the Company to commercialize its current and any future product candidates. There can be no assurance that the Company's product candidates under development will be successfully developed or that such product candidates, if successfully developed, will generate sufficient or sustainable revenues to enable the Company to be profitable Since inception, the Company has funded its research and development activities primarily through contributions from Cell Genesys, revenues from collaborative arrangements, private placements of preferred stock, equipment leaseline financings and loan facilities. The Company has incurred net losses in each of the last three years of operation, including net losses of approximately $8.3 million, $7.1 million, $35.9 million and $5.3 million in 1995, 1996, 1997 and the three months ended March 31, 1998, respectively, and as of March 31, 1998, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $57.8 million. The Company's losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in performing research and development to develop its XenoMouse technology and subsequent antibody product candidates, from the non-recurring cross-license and settlement charge and from general and administrative costs associated with the Company's operations. The Company expects to incur 6 7 additional operating losses until at least the year 2000 as a result of increases in its expenditures for research and product development, including costs associated with conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials. The Company expects that the amount of such losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of increases or decreases in the Company's research and development efforts, the execution or termination of collaborative arrangements, or the initiation, success or failure of clinical trialsThe Company expects that substantially all of its revenues for the foreseeable future will result from payments under collaborative arrangements, including fees upon signing, reimbursement for research and development and milestone payments. To date, all of the Company's revenues have resulted primarily from research and development funding and milestone payments and may not be indicative of the Company's future performance or of the ability of the Company to continue to achieve such milestones. The Company's ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability depends in part on its ability to enter into further collaborative or licensing arrangements, successfully complete preclinical or clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates and develop the capacity, either alone or through third parties, to manufacture, market and sell its products. Payments under the Company's existing and any future collaborative arrangements will be subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount and therefore the Company's revenues and results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the revenues or results of operations for any other period. There can be no assurance that the Company will enter into further collaborative arrangements, successfully complete preclinical or clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals, or successfully develop, manufacture and market product candidates. Failure to do so will have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever achieve product revenues or profitability. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Business -- Product Development Programs." NO ASSURANCE OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT All of the Company's product candidates are in the early stages of research and development and only ABX-CBL and ABX-IL8 have been used in human clinical trials. All of the Company's product candidates will require significant additional preclinical or clinical testing prior to obtaining regulatory approval for commercial use. In addition, the Company must file a product approval application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") prior to commercialization of any of the Company's products. The Company currently does not expect to file a product approval application with the FDA or corresponding regulatory filings in Europe for its product candidates at least prior to 1999 and does not expect to have any products commercially available at least prior to 2000, if at allIn addition, the Company's strategy includes building a large and diversified product portfolio, including a mix of out-licensed and internally developed product candidates. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to implement this strategy or that current or future product candidates will ever result in viable commercial products. In order to develop a single product, the Company must develop and test multiple product candidates. Development of the Company's current and any future product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products and products based on new technologies. These risks include the possibility that the Company will experience delays in development, testing or marketing, that such development, testing or marketing will result in unplanned expenditures or in expenditures above those anticipated by the Company, that the Company's products will not be proven safe or effective, that the Company's product candidates will not be easy to use or cost-effective, that third parties will develop and market superior or equivalent products, that any or all of the Company's product candidates will fail to receive any necessary regulatory approvals, that such product candidates will be difficult or uneconomical to manufacture on a commercial scale, that proprietary rights of third parties will preclude the Company or its collaborative partners from marketing such products and that the Company's products will not achieve market acceptance. As a result of these risks, there can be no 7 8 assurance that research and development efforts conducted by the Company or its collaborative partners will result in any commercially viable products. If a significant portion of the Company's development programs are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained, or any approved products are not commercially successful, there will be a material adverse effect on Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Business -- Product Development Programs." DEPENDENCE ON COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS The Company's strategy for the development and commercialization of antibody therapeutic products depends, in large part, upon the formation and maintenance of collaborative and licensing arrangements with several corporate partners. In order to successfully develop and commercialize new products and product candidates, the Company must enter into such collaborations, including collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other entities to access proprietary antigens, to fund and complete its research and development activities, preclinical and clinical testing and manufacturing, to seek and obtain regulatory approvals and to achieve successful commercialization of existing and future product candidates. The Company has recently entered into collaborative arrangements with Pfizer, Schering-Plough and Genentech to generate fully human antibodies to specific antigens in the fields of cancer, inflammation and growth factor modulation, respectively. To date, only a limited number of antibody product candidates have been generated pursuant to such collaborations, and there can be no assurance that any such collaboration will be successful. There can also be no assurance that the Company will be able to establish additional collaborative or licensing arrangements, that any such arrangements or licenses will be on terms favorable to the Company, that any such collaborative arrangements or licenses will result in commercially successful products or that the current or any future collaborative or licensing arrangements will ultimately be successful. Failure of the Company to maintain its significant collaborative arrangements or enter into additional collaborative arrangements would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operationsThe Company's dependence on collaborative and licensing arrangements with third parties subjects it to a number of risks. Agreements with collaborative partners typically allow such partners significant discretion in electing whether to pursue any of the planned activities. The Company cannot control the amount and timing of resources its collaborative partners may devote to the product candidates, and there can be no assurance that such partners will perform their obligations as expected. Business combinations or significant changes in a corporate partner's business strategy may adversely affect such partners ability to complete its obligations under the arrangements. If any collaborative partner were to terminate or breach its agreement with the Company, or otherwise fail to complete its obligations in a timely manner, such conduct could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that the Company is not able to establish further collaborative arrangements or that any or all of the Company's existing collaborative arrangements are terminated, the Company would be required to seek new collaborative arrangements or to undertake product development and commercialization at its own expense, which could significantly increase the Company's capital requirements, place additional strain on its human resource requirements and limit the number of product candidates which the Company would be able to develop and commercialize. In addition, there can be no assurance that existing and future collaborative partners will not pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others, including the Company's competitors. There can also be no assurance that disputes will not arise in the future with respect to the ownership of rights to any technology or products developed with any future collaborative partner. Lengthy negotiations with potential new collaborative partners or disagreements between established collaborative partners and the Company could lead to delays or termination in the research, development or commercialization of certain product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time consuming and expensive. Failure by any collaborative partner to develop or commercialize successfully any product candidate to which it has obtained rights from the Company or the decision by a collaborative partner 8 9 to pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products, either on their own or in collaboration with others, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company has an option to obtain licenses from Xenotech to commercialize antibody products generated by XenoMouse technology. Such option is for a certain number of targets each year. There can be no assurance that in any year the Company will exercise its rights for the full number of targets subject to such option or that such option will not limit the Company's ability to fully realize the commercial potential of its XenoMouse technology. In addition, disputes with Japan Tobacco could result in the loss of the right to commercialize a product candidate by either party. See "Business--Collaborative Arrangements." UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO CLINICAL TRIALS Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, the Company must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that its product candidates are safe and effective for use in the target disease indication. With the exception of the recently initiated multi-center confirmatory Phase II trial in GVHD, clinical trials of the Company's ABX-CBL product candidate were conducted by third parties prior to the Company obtaining license rights to technologies related to this product candidate. As of March 1, 1998, ABX-CBL had only been administered to a total of 90 patients in GVHD and organ transplant rejection indications, and Phase I clinical trials for ABX-IL8 in psoriasis commenced in April 1998. As a result, patient follow up has been limited and clinical data obtained thus far have been insufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy under applicable FDA guidelines to support an application for regulatory approval. In addition, the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. A number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results, even in later stage clinical trials, but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in advanced clinical trials. There can be no assurance that clinical trials conducted by the Company or by third parties on behalf of the Company will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for ABX-CBL or ABX-IL8. In addition, the Company's other two product candidates are still in preclinical development. The Company has not submitted investigational new drug applications ("IND") nor begun clinical trials for these two product candidates. No assurance can be given that any of the Company's preclinical or clinical development programs will be successfully completed, that any further IND will be filed or become effective, that additional clinical trials will be allowed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or that clinical trials will commence as plannedThe commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials conducted by the Company may be delayed by many factors, including inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials, slower than expected rate of patient recruitment, inability to adequately follow patients after treatment, unforeseen safety issues or any other adverse event reported during the clinical trials. The Company has limited experience in conducting or managing clinical trials and relies, and will continue to rely, on third parties to assist the Company in managing and monitoring clinical trials. Dependence on such third parties may result in delays in completing, or failure to complete, such trials if such third parties fail to perform under their agreements with the Company. Completion of trials may take several years or more, and the length of time generally varies substantially with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, delays or rejections by regulatory authorities may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development. There can be no assurance that the Company will be permitted by regulatory authorities to undertake any additional clinical trials for its potential products or, if such additional trials are conducted, that any of the Company's product candidates will prove to be safe and efficacious or will receive regulatory approvals. In addition, the Company's clinical trials are often conducted with patients who have failed conventional treatments and, in the case of GVHD, patients are often in the most advanced stages of the disease. During the course of treatment, these patients can die or suffer 9 10 adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agent being tested but which can nevertheless adversely affect the interpretation of clinical trial results. Failure of the Company's product candidates to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials could result in delays in developing other product candidates and conducting related preclinical testing and clinical trials, as well as a potential need for additional financing, any or all of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any delays in, or termination of, the Company's clinical trials would also have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be permitted by regulatory authorities to undertake any additional clinical trials for its product candidates or, if such additional trials are conducted, that any of the Company's product candidates will prove to be safe and efficacious or will receive regulatory approvals. See "Business -- Product Development Programs" and "-- Government Regulation." UNCERTAINTY OF PATENT POSITION AND DEPENDENCE ON PROPRIETARY RIGHTS The Company's success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents, protect trade secrets, operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and prevent others from infringing on the proprietary rights of the Company. The Company's policy is to seek to protect its proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to its proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of its business. Proprietary rights relating to the Company's technologies will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. There can be no assurance that any patents owned by, or licensed to, the Company will afford protection against competitors or that any pending patent applications now or hereafter filed by, or licensed to, the Company will result in patents being issued. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect the Company's intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The patent position of biopharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, their enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that any of the Company's patents or patent applications, if issued, will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Company against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by the CompanyWhile the Company has multiple patent applications pending in the United States, to date, the Company has no United States patents relating to XenoMouse technology. One issued European Patent owned by the Company relating to XenoMouse technology is currently undergoing opposition proceedings within the European Patent Office, and no assurance can be given regarding the outcome of this opposition. The Company intends to continue to file patent applications as appropriate for patents covering both its product candidates and processes. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of these applications, that any patent will issue on technology arising from additional research or that patents that may issue from such applications will be sufficient to protect the Company's technologiesPursuant to the cross-license and settlement agreement with GenPharm International, Inc., a subsidiary of Medarex, Inc., ("GenPharm"), the Company entered into a cross-license agreement with Cell Genesys, Xenotech, Japan Tobacco and GenPharm, whereby the Company has licensed on a non-exclusive basis certain patents, patent applications, third party licenses, and inventions pertaining to the development and use of certain transgenic rodents including mice that produce fully human antibodies that are integral to the Company's products and business. The Company uses its XenoMouse technology to generate fully human antibody products and has not licensed the use of, and does not use, any transgenic rodents developed or used by GenPharm. Breach of the cross-license agreement would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 10 11 Research has been conducted for many years in the antibody field. This has resulted in a substantial number of issued patents and an even larger number of patent applications. Patent applications in the United States are, in most cases, maintained in secrecy until patents issue, and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. The commercial success of the Company depends significantly on its ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance that the Company's technologies do not and will not infringe the patents or violate other proprietary rights of third parties. In the event of such infringement or violation, the Company and its corporate partners may be enjoined from pursuing development or commercialization of their products. Such action would have a material adverse affect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operationsThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and the Company, together with Cell Genesys, Xenotech and Japan Tobacco, recently settled litigation with GenPharm regarding certain patents and other intellectual property rights. See "Business -- Intellectual Property -- Patent Cross-License and Settlement Agreement with GenPharm." The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the United States and internationally involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, such proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue and their outcome is uncertain. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to the Company, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by or licensed by the Company or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings will result in substantial expense to the Company and significant diversion of effort and resources by the Company's technical and management personnel. An adverse determination in such proceedings to which the Company may become a party could subject the Company to significant liabilities to third parties or require the Company to seek licenses which may not be available from third parties or prevent the Company from selling its products in certain markets, if at all. Although patent and intellectual property disputes are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available to the Company on satisfactory terms, if at all. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could restrict or prevent the Company from manufacturing and selling its products, if any, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operationsIn addition to patents, the Company relies on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which it seeks to protect, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. There can be no assurance that such confidentiality or proprietary information agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for the Company's technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, that the parties to such agreements will not breach such agreements or that the Company's trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or be independently developed by competitors. See "Business -- Intellectual Property." INTENSE COMPETITION; RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. The Company is aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which are actively engaged in research and development in areas related to antibody therapy, that have commenced clinical trials of antibody therapeutics products or have successfully commercialized antibody products. Many of these companies are addressing diseases and disease indications which are being targeted by the Company or its collaborative partners. Certain of these competitors have specific expertise or technology related to antibody development, such as Centocor, Inc., Protein Design Labs, Inc., IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Cambridge Antibody Technology 11 12 Group, Inc. and GenPharm. Certain of the Company's competitors are developing or testing product candidates that may be directly competitive with the Company's product candidates. For example, the Company is aware that several companies, including Genentech, Inc., have potential product candidates that may inhibit the activity of IL-8. Furthermore, the Company is aware that ImClone Systems, Inc. has a potential product candidate in clinical development that may inhibit the activity of EGF. Many of these companies and institutions, either alone or together with their corporate partners, have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than the Company. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their corporate partners, have significantly greater experience than the Company in developing products, undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and manufacturing and marketing products. Accordingly, the Company's competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA approval or commercializing products more rapidly than the Company. If the Company commences commercial sales of products, it will be competing against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities, areas in which it has limited or no experienceIn addition to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, the Company faces, and will continue to face, competition from academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. There are numerous competitors working on products to treat each of the diseases for which the Company is seeking to develop therapeutic products. In addition, any product candidate successfully developed by the Company may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use. Competition may also arise from other drug development technologies and methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease and new small molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents. There can be no assurance that developments by others will not render the Company's product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The Company faces and will continue to face intense competition from other companies, including Japan Tobacco, for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, and for licenses to proprietary technology. These competitors, either alone or with their corporate partners, may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective than those of the Company. The Company's collaborative partners may elect to develop other antibody products which compete with the Company's products. See "Business -- Competition." SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; NO ASSURANCE OF REGULATORY APPROVALS All new biopharmaceutical products, including the Company's product candidates under development and anticipated future products, are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the federal government, principally the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FD&C Act") and other laws including the Public Health Service Act, and by state and local governments. Such regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of such products. If biopharmaceutical products are marketed abroad, they also are subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments. To date, none of the Company's product candidates has been approved for sale in the United States or any foreign market. The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Securing FDA approvals requires</td>

        <td class="fillremaining">risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before making a decision to invest in our common stock. risks related to our business and the oil and natural gas industry oil and natural gas prices are volatile and change for reasons that are beyond our control. a decrease in oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. a substantial decline in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production would have a material adverse effect on us, as our future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon those prices. for example, changes in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas affect our ability to finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, borrow money and satisfy our financial obligations. in addition, declines in prices could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our reserves. oil and natural gas are commodities and their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. prices have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current world geopolitical conditions. furthermore, the oil we produce in california is generally heavier than, and therefore sells at a discount to, premium grade light oil, and the amount of that discount varies over time. the price for the heavier oil we produce is affected by factors that may not have the same impact on the price of premium grade light oil. for example, in 2005, the price of our oil was negatively affected by an increase in the supply of heavy oil from ecuador, which increased the discount we received for our oil compared to premium grade light oil. we cannot predict how the discount will change in the future, and it is possible that it will increase. the difficulty involved in predicting the discount also makes it more difficult for us to effectively hedge our production. transportation costs and capacity constraints can also reduce the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. the prices of oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of other factors that are beyond our control, including: changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas; commodity processing, gathering and transportation availability; actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; domestic and foreign political developments, including embargoes, affecting oil-producing activity; the level of global oil and natural gas exploration activity and inventories; the price, availability and consumer acceptance of alternative fuel sources; the availability of refining capacity; technological advances affecting energy consumption; weather conditions; financial and commercial market uncertainty; and worldwide economic conditions. these factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements. our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantity and present value of our reserves. the reserve data included in this prospectus represent estimates only. estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process. it requires interpretations of available technical data and various estimates, including estimates based upon assumptions relating to economic factors, such as future commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes and availability of capital, estimates of required capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental regulation. the assumptions underlying our estimates of our proved reserves (including those attributable to the texcal transaction) could prove to be inaccurate, and any significant inaccuracy could materially affect our future estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of our future net cash flows. our estimated proved reserves at year-end 2004 were approximately 6.3 mmboe lower than they were at the end of 2003. the reduction was due primarily to reclassifications of reserves as a result of new information from a pressure study conducted on one of our producing reservoirs, a reevaluation of a development plan for an expected waterflood, a contractual production constraint that was not mitigated to the extent we had expected and the depletion that occurred as we produced oil and natural gas from our properties. in addition, our estimated proved reserves at december31, 2005 were approximately 3.9mmboe lower than at december31, 2004, primarily because of the sale of our big mineral creek property (partially offset by net reserve acquisitions during the year), depletion that occurred as we produced oil and natural gas from our properties and other adjustments based on reservoir information. similar events in the future could lead to downward revisions of our reserve estimates, and those revisions could be material. at july31, 2006, 43.4% of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and 5.5% were proved developed non-producing. estimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves is almost always based on analogy to existing wells as contrasted with the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. revenues from estimated proved developed non-producing reserves will not be realized until some time in the future, if at all. you should not assume that the present values referred to in this prospectus represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. the timing of the production and the expenses related to the development of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. in addition, our pv-10 estimates are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimates. actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. further, the effect of derivative instruments is not reflected in these assumed prices. also, the use of a 10% discount factor to calculate pv-10 value may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject. any significant variations from the interpretations or assumptions used in our estimates, such as increased or decreased production levels or changes of conditions and information resulting from new or reinterpreted seismic data or otherwise, could cause the estimated quantities and net present value of our reserves to change materially.our business involves significant operating risks that could adversely affect our production and could be expensive to remedy. our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including: well blowouts; cratering and explosions; pipe failures and ruptures; pipeline accidents and failures; casing collapses; fires; mechanical and operational problems that affect production; formations with abnormal pressures; uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids; and releases of contaminants into the environment. for example, in may2005, we encountered downhole mechanical problems during a routine workover on a well in the south ellwood field. as a result of the problems, average net production from the well dropped from 1,155 boe/d in april2005 to 262 boe/d in may2005 before being restored to 1,309 boe/d in december2005. in addition, our efforts to restore production at the well required us to delay the implementation of some other projects. we may experience similar problems and delays from time to time in the future. our offshore operations are further subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, including a dependence on a limited number of gas and water injection wells and electrical transmission lines. for example, we are currently adding additional salt water disposal capacity in the south ellwood field to supplement existing disposal wells. failure to complete this project in a timely manner could result in a curtailment of production from the field. moreover, because we operate in california, we are also susceptible to risks posed by natural disasters such as earthquakes, mudslides, fires and floods. for example, our production in the first quarter of 2006 was adversely affected by heavy rain and flooding in northern california. in addition to lost production and increased costs, these hazards could cause serious injuries, fatalities, contamination or property damage for which we could be held responsible. the potential consequences of these hazards are particularly severe for us because a significant portion of our operations are conducted offshore and in other environmentally sensitive areas, including areas with significant residential populations. we do not maintain insurance in amounts that cover all of the losses to which we may be subject, and insurance may not continue to be available on acceptable terms. the occurrence of an uninsured or underinsured loss could result in significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. in addition, maintenance activities undertaken to reduce operational risks can be costly and can require exploration, exploitation and development operations to be curtailed while those activities are being completed. for example, our production for the third quarter of 2006 was adversely affected by maintenance activities performed at two of our fields. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoverviewtrends affecting our results of operations."the marketability of our production is dependent upon gathering systems, transportation facilities and processing facilities that we do not control. for our largest field, we rely on one barge to transport production from the field. when these facilities or systems, including the barge, are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced. the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, transportation barges and processing facilities owned by third parties. in general, we do not control these facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied due to circumstances beyond our control. a significant disruption in the availability of these facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market the oil and natural gas we produce and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. in some cases, our ability to deliver to market our oil and natural gas is dependent upon coordination among third parties who own transportation and processing facilities we use, and any inability or unwillingness of those parties to coordinate efficiently could also interrupt our operations. these are risks for which we generally do not maintain insurance. we are at particular risk with respect to oil produced at our south ellwood field, which is our largest field in terms of proved reserves. our average net production from the field in september2006 was 3,180 bbl/d, or approximately 17% of our aggregate net production for the month. the oil produced at the field is delivered via a barge owned and operated by an unaffiliated third party. this third party is the only company that currently has a permit to deliver oil via barge in the vicinity of the field and, at this time, the barge is the only means available to us for delivery of oil produced from the field. our loss of the use of the barge, in the absence of a satisfactory alternative delivery arrangement, would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, the barge is unavailable due to maintenance and repair requirements. for example, it was out of service for part of august2006 due to scheduled maintenance. in addition, in october, 2006, the barge was involved in a minor collision with a tugboat and was out of service for repair and inspection for approximately two weeks. because we have limited storage capacity for oil produced from the field, we were required to significantly curtail production at the field during the period in which the barge was unavailable. as described in "business and propertiesdescription of propertiescoastal californiasouth ellwood field," the owner of the refinery to which we have historically delivered oil production from the field informed us in august2006 that it was unwilling to accept further deliveries from the barge. as a result, we have sold recent shipments of oil production from the field to a refinery in the san francisco area on a shipment-by-shipment basis. however, that refinery is not obligated to accept more than one additional delivery of approximately 53,000 bbls. moreover, the average price we received from the sales to that refinery was approximately $15.31 less per bbl than we received from previous sales, and the associated transportation costs were approximately $0.59 higher per bbl (in each case based on sales through september30, 2006). any new delivery or sales arrangement may require time to implement and may require us to accept lower prices for our production and/or incur higher transportation costs. our ability to implement a new delivery or sales arrangement may be adversely affected by the fact that there are only a limited number of refineries in california. further, our existing storage facilities have only limited capacity. if we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement an acceptable delivery or sales arrangement, we will be required to shut in or curtail production from the field. any such shut in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil produced from the field, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we would be similarly affected if any of the other transportation, gathering and processing facilities we use became unavailable or unable to provide services.we may discover problems arising from the texcal transaction for which we have no recourse against the sellers. we conducted a review of texcal's business, properties, liabilities and operations prior to entering into the texcal merger agreement. in the course of our review, we relied to a significant extent on information provided by texcal. we did not independently verify all of the information provided to us. to the extent that information consisted of estimates, those estimates may vary from actual results. in addition, the scope of our review was not comprehensive enough to uncover all potential problems that could affect us as a result of the transaction. accordingly, it is possible that we will discover problems with the business, properties or operations we acquired, or the liabilities we assumed, that we did not anticipate at the time we completed the transaction. these problems may be material and could include, among other things, unexpected environmental problems, title defects or other liabilities. the merger agreement contained representations from texcal concerning its business, properties, operations and liabilities, but those representations expired at the closing of the transaction. as a result, it is unlikely that we will have any recourse against the sellers if we subsequently discover inaccuracies in those representations or other liabilities arising from pre-acquisition operations of texcal.acquisitions involve a number of risks, including the risk that we will be adversely affected by a failure to efficiently integrate acquired operations. our ability to achieve the benefits we expect from the texcal transaction will depend in part upon our ability to efficiently integrate texcal's operations with ours. our management may be required to dedicate significant time and effort to the integration process, which could divert its attention from other business concerns. the challenges involved in the integration process include retaining key employees and maintaining key employee morale, addressing differences in business cultures, processes and systems and developing internal expertise regarding the texcal properties. we will face similar risks with respect to other acquisitions we complete in the future. more generally, the success of any acquisition will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to accurately assess the reserves associated with the property, future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors. these assessments are necessarily inexact. as a result, we may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property or recognize an acceptable return from such sales. the risks normally associated with acquisitions are heightened in the current environment, as market prices of oil and natural gas properties are generally high compared to historical norms. in addition, we may face greater risks to the extent we acquire properties in areas outside of california, as we did when we acquired texcal, because we may be less familiar with operating, regulatory and other issues specific to those areas.our debt level and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. we financed the acquisition of texcal through the incurrence of $469.5million of indebtedness under our credit facilities. as of november10, 2006, we had total indebtedness under the credit facilities and our 8.75% senior notes due 2011 of approximately $698.5million, which bore interest at a weighted average rate of 9.1%. because we must dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on our debt, that portion of our cash flow is not available for other purposes. in addition, borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at rates that vary with changes in market rates. accordingly, an increase in market rates could significantly increase our debt service obligations. our ability to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and pursue our capital expenditure plan will depend to a significant extent on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and a variety of other factors. our cash flow from operations and other capital resources may not be sufficient to pay the principal and interest on our debt in the future. if our cash flow and other capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled capital projects, sell material assets or operations or restructure our debt. in the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt to meet our debt service and other obligations, the terms of any such transaction may not be favorable to us and may not be completed in a timely fashion. in addition, our credit facilities contain mandatory prepayment provisions that would limit our ability to respond to a shortfall in our expected liquidity by selling assets, issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness. in particular, the facilities would require us to use some or all of the proceeds of such transactions to reduce amounts outstanding under one or both of those facilities. see "description of indebtedness." our level of indebtedness, and the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facilities, which we refer to collectively as our "debt agreements," could have important consequences for our operations, including by: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and from sales of assets and stock to required payments on debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition opportunities and other general business activities; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other activities; limiting management's discretion in operating our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in commodity prices or our business, the industry in which we operate and/or commodity prices; impairing our ability to withstand successfully a downturn in commodity prices or our business or the economy generally; placing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors; and making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates. in addition, under the terms of our debt agreements, we must comply with certain financial and other covenants, including leverage and current ratio requirements. our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, market and competitive factors, in particular the selling prices for our oil and natural gas and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy. the breach of any of the covenants in our debt agreements could result in a default under the applicable agreement, which would permit the affected lenders or noteholders, as the case may be, to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and to foreclose on substantially all of our assets. in the event of an actual or potential default, we could attempt to refinance the debt or repay the debt with the proceeds from an equity offering or from sales of assets. the proceeds of future borrowings, equity financings or asset sales may not be sufficient to refinance or repay the debt. the terms of our debt agreements may also prohibit us from taking such actions. factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and the value of our assets and our operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing. we may not be able to complete any such offering, refinancing or sale of assets on desirable terms or at all.our operations are subject to a variety of contractual, regulatory and other constraints that can limit our production and increase our operating costs, and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. we are subject to a variety of contractual, regulatory and other operating constraints that limit the manner in which we conduct our business. these constraints affect, among other things, the permissible uses of our facilities, the availability of pipeline capacity to transport our production and the manner in which we produce oil and natural gas. these constraints can change to our detriment without our consent. for example, effective january2003, the terms of the sales gas transportation contract relating to the south ellwood field were revised to reduce the permitted amount of carbon dioxide in the natural gas we transport from the field from 5% to 3%. additionally, the method of measuring carbon dioxide levels was made more stringent. to comply with these new requirements, we shut in some high gas-to-oil ratio wells, which reduced our gas sales from the field from 4.2mmcf/d in 2002 to 2.5mmcf/d in 2003. similar events may occur in the future. these events, many of which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition and could reduce estimates of our proved reserves.our hedging arrangements involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in financial losses or reduce our income. to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a substantial portion of our oil and natural gas production. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for a summary of our hedging activity. hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when: production is less than expected; a counterparty to a hedging contract fails to perform under the contract; there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received; or there is a sudden, unexpected event that materially impacts oil or natural gas prices. our total net realized losses on derivative instruments were $10.3million, $17.6million and $22.9million for the years ended december31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, and $19.8million for the nine months ended september30, 2006. in addition, we have incurred substantial unrealized commodity derivative losses in some recent periods, including total net losses of $34.7million in 2005. these unrealized losses resulted from the fact that some of our derivative positions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. changes in the fair market value of the derivatives were therefore required to be recognized in the statement of operations. we may incur realized and unrealized losses of this type in the future. hedging arrangements may also limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas. the uncertainties associated with our hedging programs are greater than those of many of our competitors because the price of the heavy oil that we produce in california is subject to risks that are in addition to the price risk associated with premium grade light oil. our working capital could be impacted if we enter into derivatives arrangements that require cash collateral and commodity prices subsequently change in a manner adverse to us. further, the obligation to post cash or other collateral could, if imposed, adversely affect our liquidity.we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to replace our reserves. reserves can be replaced through acquisitions of new properties or the exploration, exploitation and development of existing properties. either approach requires substantial capital, and capital may not always be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. if our cash flow from operations and cash available from other sources is less than we anticipate, we may not be able to finance the capital expenditures, or complete the acquisitions, necessary to replace our reserves. a reduction in our reserves could, in turn, further limit the availability of capital, as the maximum amount of available borrowing under the revolving credit facility is, and the availability of other sources of capital likely will be, based in part on the estimated quantities of our proved reserves. oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities may not be successful and could result in a complete loss of a significant investment. exploration, exploitation and development activities are subject to many risks. for example, new wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. similarly, previously producing wells that are returned to production after a period of being shut in may not produce at levels that justify the expenditures made to bring the wells back on line. drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. we endeavor to utilize the knowledge of the fractured monterey shale formation we have developed in our offshore drilling operations in onshore exploratory drilling, and our assumptions about the consistency of this formation may not be correct. the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically. the cost of exploration, exploitation and development activities is subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. further, our development activities may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including: title problems; problems in delivery of our oil and natural gas to market; pressure or irregularities in geological formations; equipment failures or accidents; shortages of, or delays in obtaining, equipment or qualified personnel; adverse weather conditions; reductions in oil and natural gas prices; compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and services.a failure to complete successful acquisitions would limit our growth. our strategy is to increase our reserves and production, in part through the acquisition of additional oil and natural gas properties, or businesses that own or operate such properties, when attractive opportunities arise. our focus on the california market reduces the pool of suitable acquisition opportunities. if we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller or finance the acquisition. our revolving credit agreement currently prohibits us from effecting acquisitions with an aggregate value in excess of the aggregate value of assets we sell, and in any event in excess of $15.0million in any year. the substantial indebtedness we incurred in the texcal transaction will further limit our ability to make future acquisitions. if we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions, it will be more difficult to replace our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and may adversely affect our results of operations. we operate in a competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas, integrating new technologies and employing skilled personnel. many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. those companies may be willing and able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and prospects than our financial resources permit, and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects. our competitors may also enjoy technological advantages over us and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with respect to acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing our production, attracting and retaining qualified personnel, implementing new technologies and raising additional capital.we are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, that can adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of doing business. our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to exploration for, and the exploitation, development, production and

      <td>RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. If the key markets within the semiconductor industry, especially semiconductor manufacturers, do not adopt our proprietary technologies and software products, we may be unable to generate sales of our productsThe four key markets within the semiconductor industry are semiconductor designers and design tool vendors, photomask manufacturers, semiconductor equipment manufacturers and semiconductor manufacturers. If these key markets do not adopt our proprietary technologies and software products, our product sales could decline. We design our technologies and products so that each key market within the semiconductor industry can work efficiently with the other markets. For example, if designers do not adopt our technologies and products, it will be more difficult for them to design semiconductors which are understood and processed efficiently by mask manufacturers that do adopt our technologies and products. In addition, we believe semiconductor manufacturers need to adopt our proprietary technologies and software products first in order to drive adoption by the other three markets. Semiconductor manufacturers define and develop the manufacturing process. While designers, mask manufacturers and equipment manufacturers are not required to adopt our technologies and products in order to work with semiconductor manufacturers that do adopt them, the efficiency of the entire manufacturing process is greatly diminished if they do not. If each key market of the semiconductor industry does not perceive our proprietary technologies and software products as the industry standard, our technologies and products could become less valuable and more difficult to license. Factors that may limit adoption of our subwavelength solution within the markets include: . our current and potential industry partners and customers may fail to adopt our technologies and products; . semiconductor designers may not need subwavelength processes if there is a slowdown in semiconductor manufacturing or a decrease in the demand for smaller semiconductor feature sizes; and . the industry may develop alternative methods to produce subwavelength features with existing capital equipment due to a rapidly evolving market and the likely emergence of new technologies. In order for potential industry partners and customers to adopt, and expend their own resources to implement, our technologies and products, we must expend significant marketing resources, with no guarantee of successOur proprietary technologies and software products involve a new approach to the subwavelength gap problem. As a result, we must employ intensive and sophisticated marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective industry partners and customers about the benefits of our technologies and products, with no guarantee of success. Our sales and marketing expenses increased from $1.4 million in 1998 to $4.3 million in 1999. In addition, even if our industry partners and customers adopt our proprietary technologies and software products, they must devote the resources necessary to fully integrate our technologies and products into their operations. This is especially true for our industry partners so that they can begin to resell and market our solution to their customers. If they do not make these expenditures, establishing our technologies and products as the industry standard to the subwavelength gap problem will be difficult. Our limited operating history and dependence on new technologies make it difficult to evaluate our future prospectsWe only have a limited operating history on which you can base your evaluation of our business. We face a number of risks as an emerging company in a new market. For example, the key markets within the 7 semiconductor industry may fail to adopt our proprietary technologies and software products, or we may not be able to establish distribution channels. Our company incorporated in October 1995. In February 1997, we shipped our initial software product, IC Workbench. We have only recently begun to expand our operations significantly. For example, we grew from 47 employees as of January 1, 1999 to 105 employees as of January 1, 2000. We have a history of losses, we expect to incur losses in the future and we may be unable to achieve profitabilityWe may not achieve profitability if our revenue increases more slowly than we expect or not at all. In addition, our operating expenses are largely fixed, and any shortfall in anticipated revenue in any given period could cause our operating results to decrease. We have not been profitable in any quarter, and our accumulated deficit was approximately $16.2 million as of December 31, 1999. We expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses in connection with increased funding for research and development and expansion of our sales and marketing efforts. In addition, we expect to incur additional noncash charges relating to amortization of intangibles and deferred stock compensation. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Any of the factors discussed above could cause our stock price to decline. We recently acquired Transcription Enterprises Limited and if we are not successful in integrating Transcription's products and operations with ours, our revenue and operating results could declineOur recent acquisition of Transcription Enterprises Limited will only be successful if we are able to integrate its operations with ours, which could substantially divert management's attention from the day-to-day operations of the combined company. If we encounter any difficulties in the transition process, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could decline. We must successfully integrate Transcription's products with ours. We must also coordinate our research and development and sales and marketing efforts to realize the technological benefits of this combinationWe may find it difficult to integrate personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combine two different corporate cultures. In addition, the process of combining our company with Transcription could interrupt the activities of either or both of the companies' businesses. It is possible that we will not be able to retain key Transcription management, technical and sales personnelIn addition, the acquisition of Transcription could cause our industry partners and customers to be uncertain about our ability to support the combined companies' products and the direction of the combined companies' product development efforts. As a result, they may delay or cancel product orders, which could significantly decrease our revenue and limit our ability to implement our combined business strategy. Our acquisition of Transcription may increase the focus of the semiconductor industry on the manufacturing data preparation market, which could lead to a rapid and substantial increase in competitionOur recent acquisition of Transcription may increase the semiconductor industry's awareness of the market for manufacturing data preparation software, which could lead to a substantial increase in the number of start-up companies that focus on software solutions for data preparation. Manufacturing data preparation software translates semiconductor designs into instructions that control manufacturing equipment. Potential competitors could pursue and execute partnership agreements with key industry partners we intend to pursue, which could make it difficult or impossible for us to develop relationships with these potential industry partners. In addition, some of our current competitors may increase their own research and development budgets relating to data preparation, or may more aggressively market competing solutions. 8 If we do not continue to introduce new technologies and software products or product enhancements ahead of rapid technological change in the market for subwavelength solutions, our operating results could decline and we could lose our competitive positionWe must continually devote significant engineering resources to enable us to introduce new technologies and software products or product enhancements to address the evolving needs of key markets within the semiconductor industry in solving the subwavelength gap problem. We must introduce these innovations and the key markets within the semiconductor industry must adopt them before changes in the semiconductor industry, such as the introduction by our current and potential competitors of more advanced products or the emergence of alternative technologies, render the innovations obsolete, which could cause us to lose our competitive position. These innovations are inherently complex, require long development cycles and a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability. Moreover, designers, mask manufacturers and equipment manufacturers must each respond to the demand of the market to design and manufacture masks and equipment for increasingly smaller and complex semiconductors. Our innovations must be viable and meet the needs of these key markets within the semicondutor industry before the consumer market demands even smaller semiconductors, rendering the innovations obsolete. We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund any future innovations. In addition, any revenue that we receive from enhancements or new generations of our proprietary technologies and software products may be less than the costs of development. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to declineIt is likely that our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate from time to time and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future period. As a result, the price of our common stock could decline. Historically, our quarterly operating results have fluctuated. We may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results. The following factors may cause these fluctuations: . the timing and structure of our product license agreements; . changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; and . changes in the level of our operating expenses to support our projected growth. We intend to pursue new, and maintain our current, industry partner relationships, which could substantially divert management attention and resources, with no guarantee of successWe expect to derive significant benefits, including increased revenue and customer awareness, from our current and potential industry partner relationships. In our pursuit to maintain and establish partner relationships within each of the key markets in the semiconductor industry, we could expend significant management attention, resources and sales personnel efforts, with no guarantee of success. To establish and maintain our partner relationships, we expend our limited financial resources on increasing our sales and business development personnel, trade shows and marketing within trade publications. If we did not have to pursue potential industry partners, we could focus these resources exclusively on direct sales to our customers. In addition, through our partner relationships, our partners resell, market, either jointly with us or unilaterally, and promote our technologies and products. If these relationships terminate, such as due to our material breach of the contracts or the partners' election to cancel the contract, which generally is permissible with prior notice to us, we would have to increase our own limited marketing and sales resources for these activities. Further, we may be unable to enter into new industry partner relationships if any of the following occur: . current or potential industry partners develop their own solutions to the subwavelength gap problem; or . our current or potential competitors establish relationships with industry partners with which we seek to establish a relationship. 9 We have only recently entered into many of our current partner relationships. These relationships may not continue or they may not be successful. We also may be unable to find suitable additional industry partners. To date, we have entered into agreements with industry partners, including: . Cadence in the design market; . DuPont Photomask and Photronics in the mask manufacturing market; and . Applied Materials, KLA-Tencor and Zygo Corporation in the semiconductor equipment market. Many of our current competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and as a result, they may acquire a significant market share before we Our current competitors, or alliances among these competitors, may rapidly acquire significant market share. These competitors may have greater name recognition and more customers which they could use to gain market share to our detriment. We encounter direct competition from other direct providers of phase shifting, OPC and manufacturing data technologies. These competitors include such companies as Avant! and Mentor Graphics. We also compete with companies that have developed or have the ability to develop their own proprietary phase shifting and OPC solutions, such as IBM. These companies may wish to promote their internally developed products and may be reluctant to purchase products from us or other independent vendors. Our competitors may offer a wider range of products than we do and thus may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and customer requirements. These competitors may also be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to customers than we do and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Moreover, our competitors may establish relationships among themselves or with industry partners to enhance their services, including industry partners with which we may desire to establish a relationship. The market for software solutions that address the subwavelength gap problem is new and rapidly evolving. We expect competition to intensify in the future, which could slow our ability to grow or execute our strategyWe believe that the demand for solutions to the subwavelength gap problem may encourage many competitors to enter into our market. As the market for software solutions to the subwavelength gap problem proliferates, if our competitors are able to attract industry partners or customers on a more accelerated pace than we can and retain them more effectively, we would not be able to grow and execute our strategy as quickly. In addition, if customer preferences shift away from our technologies and software products as a result of the increase in competition, we must develop new proprietary technologies and software products to address these new customer demands. This could result in the diversion of management attention or our development of new technologies and products may be blocked by other companies' patents. We must offer better products, customer support, prices and response time, or a combination of these factors, than those of our potential competitors. We are growing rapidly and must effectively manage and support our growth in order for our business strategy to succeedWe have grown rapidly and will need to continue to grow in all areas of operation. If we are unable to successfully integrate and support our existing and new employees into our operations, we may be unable to implement our business strategy in the time frame we anticipate, or at all. Due to our rapid growth in headcount, we outgrew our principal office facilities earlier than we expected. As a result, we recently relocated to San Jose, California and may need to relocate to a larger facility in the future, which could be difficult in the very competitive Silicon Valley office leasing market. In addition, building and managing the support necessary for our growth places significant demands on our management as well as our limited revenue. These demands have, and may continue to, divert these resources away from the continued growth of our business and 10 implementation of our business strategy. Further, we must adequately train our new personnel, especially our technical support personnel, to adequately, and accurately, respond to and support our industry partners and customers. If we fail to do this, it could lead to dissatisfaction among our partners or customers, which could slow our growth. We must continually attract and retain engineering personnel or we will be unable to execute our business strategyWe have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our rapid growth and expansion. We must continually enhance and introduce new generations of our phase shifting and OPC technologies. As a result, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate qualified engineering personnel with the requisite educational background and industry experience. If we lose the services of a significant number of our engineers, it could disrupt our ability to implement our business strategy. Competition for qualified engineers is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley where we are located. Our chief executive officer and chief technology officer, as well as the co- founders of Transcription, are critical to our business and they may not remain with us in the futureOur future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of Y. C. (Buno) Pati, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Yao- Ting Wang, our Chief Technology Officer, Roger Sturgeon, one of our directors and a senior executive of Transcription and Kevin MacLean, Vice President and General Manager of Transcription. If we lose the services of any of these key executives, it could slow our product development processes and searching for their replacements could divert our other senior management's time and increase our operating expenses. In addition, our industry partners and customers could become concerned about our future operations, which could injure our reputation. We do not have long-term employment agreements with these executives and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on their lives. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technologies which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue or increase our costsOur success depends heavily upon proprietary technologies, specifically our patent portfolio. The rights granted under our patents and patent applications may not provide competitive advantages to us. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights and incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Litigation could also divert our resources, including our managerial and engineering resources. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights and prevent competitors from using our proprietary technologies in their products. These laws and procedures provide only limited protection. We have been issued two U.S. patents, have five U.S. patent applications currently pending in the U.S. and nine foreign patent applications currently pending in selected foreign countries. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Also, patent protection in foreign countries may be limited or unavailable where we have filed for and need such protection. Furthermore, if we fail to adequately protect our trademark rights, this could impair our brand identity and ability to compete effectively. If we do not successfully protect our trademark rights, this could force us to incur costs to re-establish our name or our product names, including significant marketing activities. If third parties assert that our proprietary technologies and software products infringe their intellectual property rights, this could injure our reputation and limit our ability to license or sell our proprietary technologies or software productsThird parties, for competitive or other reasons, could assert that our proprietary technologies and software products infringe their intellectual property rights. These claims could injure our reputation and decrease or 11 block our ability to license or sell our software products. For example, on March 14, 2000, ASML MaskTools, Inc. filed a complaint alleging we infringe two U.S. patents and have committed unfair or fraudulent business practice under the California Business and Professions Code. We are currently investigating the patents and allegations. The defense of these claims could divert management's attention from the day to day operations of our company, as well as divert resources from current planned uses, such as hiring and supporting additional engineering personnel. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and an adverse decision could limit our ability to offer some features in our OPC product. Third parties have advised us of literature which they believe to be relevant to our patents. We have not reviewed all of the information contained in this literature. It is possible that this literature or literature we may be advised of in the future could negatively affect the scope or enforceability of our present or future patents, and/or result in costly litigation. In addition, we are aware of and are evaluating certain patents with which our products, patents or patent applications may conflict. If any of these patents are found to be valid, and we are unable to license such patents on reasonable terms, or if our products, patents, or patent applications are found to conflict with these patents, we could be prevented from selling our products, our patents may be declared invalid or our patent applications may not result in issued patents. In addition, a company could invite us to take a patent license. If we do not take the license, the requesting company could contact our industry partners or customers and suggest that they not use our software products because we are not licensed under their patents. This action by the requesting company could affect our relationships with these industry partners and customers and may prevent future industry partners and customers from licensing our software products. The intensely competitive nature of our industry and the important nature of our technologies to our competitors' businesses may contribute to the likelihood of being subject to third party claims of this nature. Please see "Business--Intellectual Property." Any potential dispute involving our patents or other intellectual property could include our industry partners and customers, which could trigger our indemnification obligations with them and result in substantial expense to usIn any potential dispute involving our patents or other intellectual property, our licensees could also become the target of litigation. This could trigger our technical support and indemnification obligations in some of our license agreements which could result in substantial expense to us. In addition to the time and expense required for us to supply such support or indemnification to our licensees, any such litigation could severely disrupt or shut down the business of our licensees, which in turn could hurt our relations with our customers and cause the sale of our proprietary technologies and software products to decrease. Defects in our proprietary technologies and software products could decrease our revenue and our competitive market shareIf our industry partners and customers discover any defects after they implement our proprietary technologies and software products, these defects could significantly decrease the market acceptance and sales of our software products, which could decrease our competitive market share. Any actual or perceived defects with our proprietary technologies and software products may also hinder our ability to attract or retain industry partners or customers, leading to a decrease in our revenue. These defects are frequently found during the period following introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products. Despite testing prior to introduction, our software products may contain software errors not discovered until after customer implementation. If our software products contain errors or defects, it could require us to expend significant resources to alleviate these problems, which could result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts. We face operational and financial risks associated with international operationsWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales. We have only limited experience in developing, marketing, selling and supporting our proprietary technologies and software products 12 internationally and may not succeed in maintaining or expanding our international operations, which could slow our revenue growth. We are subject to risks inherent in doing business in international markets. These risks include: . fluctuations in exchange rates which may negatively affect our operating results; . greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable resulting in longer collection periods; . compliance with and unexpected changes in a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar; . export controls which could prevent us from shipping our software products into and from some markets; . changes in import/export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our software products and reduce our market share in some countries; and . economic or political instabilityWe may be unable to continue to market our proprietary technologies and software products successfully in international markets. We may need to raise additional funds to support our growth or execute our strategy and if we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or enhance our proprietary technologies and software products, respond to competitive pressures or acquire desired businesses or technologiesWe currently anticipate that our available cash resources, combined with the net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional funds in order to: . support more rapid expansion; . develop new or enhanced products; . respond to competitive pressures; or . acquire complementary businesses or technologiesThese factors will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds. We may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements. We may be unable to consummate other potential acquisitions or investments or successfully integrate them with our business, which may slow our ability to expand the range of our proprietary technologies and software productsTo expand the range of our proprietary technologies and software products, we may acquire or make investments in additional complementary businesses, technologies or products if appropriate opportunities arise. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms, or consummate future acquisitions or investments, each of which could slow our growth strategy. If we do acquire additional companies or make other types of acquisitions, we may have difficulty integrating the acquired products, personnel or technologies. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. Management will have broad discretion as to the use of proceeds from this offering and, as a result, we may not use the proceeds to the satisfaction of our stockholdersOur board of directors and management will have broad discretion in allocating the net proceeds of this offering. They may choose to allocate such proceeds in ways that do not yield a favorable return or are not 13 supported by our stockholders. We have designated only limited specific uses for the net proceeds from this offering. Please see "Use of Proceeds." The concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders upon the completion of this offering will likely limit your ability to influence corporate mattersThe concentration of ownership of our outstanding capital stock with our directors and executive officers after this offering may limit your ability to influence corporate matters. Prior to the completion of this offering, our directors and executive officers, and their affiliates, beneficially own 67.0% of our outstanding capital stock, and we expect them to remain significant stockholders upon the completion of this offering. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will have the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and the approval of any corporate transactions. We have anti-takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our companyProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect after completion of this offering and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Please see "Description of Capital Stock." Negotiations between the underwriters and us determined the initial public offering price, but the market price may be less or may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering priceThis initial public offering price may vary from the market price of our common stock after the offering. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: . actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; . changes in market valuations of other technology companies; . conditions or trends in the semiconductor industry; . announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions or partnerships; . additions or departures of key personnel; . any deviations in net revenue or in losses from levels expected by securities analysts; . volume fluctuations, which are particularly common among highly volatile securities of technology related companies; and . sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or other securities in the open marketGeneral political or economic conditions, such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations in the United States or abroad, also could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Please see "Underwriting." Our stock price is likely to be extremely volatile as the market for technology companies' stock has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuationsVolatility in the market price of our common stock could result in securities class action litigation. Any litigation would likely result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. Despite the strong pattern of operating losses of technology companies, the market demand, valuation and trading prices of these companies have been high. At the same time, the share prices of these companies' stocks have been highly volatile and have recorded lows well below their historical highs. As a result, investors 14 in these companies often buy the stock at very high prices only to see the price drop substantially a short time later, resulting in an extreme drop in value in the stock holdings of these investors. Our stock may not trade at the same levels as other technology stocks. In addition, technology stocks in general may not sustain current market prices. An active public market for our common stock may not developAn active public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained after this offering.

      <td>risk factors an investment in our common stock involves risks. before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the other information included in this prospectus. the discussion below presents material risks associated with an investment in our common stock. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. in such a case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. the risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. see cautionary noteregarding forward-looking statements. risks related to our businessour decisions regarding credit risk could be inaccurate and our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of our secured loans. we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we consider adequate to absorb future losses which may occur in our loan portfolio. in determining the size of the allowance, we analyze our loan portfolio based on our historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, national and local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. as of march31, 2006, our allowance for loan losses was approximately $24.4million, or 1.96% of our total loans receivable. if our assumptions are incorrect, our current allowance may be insufficient to cover future loan losses, and increased loan loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. in addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of our management. any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs could have a negative effect on our operating results.because we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate, a downturn in the real estate market could result in losses and materially and adversely affect business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate. as of march31, 2006, approximately 82.2% of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. an adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate generally or in our primary markets specifically could significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. furthermore, it is likely that we would be required to increase our provision for loan losses. if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses, our profitability and financial condition could be adversely impacted.because we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers, a significant loss on any of those loans could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers. under applicable law, each of our bank subsidiaries is generally permitted to make loans to one borrowing relationship up to 20% of their respective capital in the case of our arkansas bank subsidiaries, and 15% of capital (25% on secured loans) in the case of our florida bank subsidiary. historically, when our bank subsidiaries have lending relationships that exceed their individual loan to one borrower limitation, the overline, or amount in excess of the subsidiarybanks legal lending limit, is participated to our other bank subsidiaries. as a result, on a consolidated basis we may have aggregate exposure to individual or related borrowers in excess of each individual bank subsidiarys legal lending limit. as of march31, 2006, the aggregate legal lending limit of our bank subsidiaries for secured loans was approximately $34.4million. currently, our board of directors has established an in-house consolidated lending limit of $16.0million to any one borrowing relationship without obtaining the approval of our chairman and our vice chairman. as of march31, 2006, we had 11 borrowing relationships where we had a commitment to loan in excess of $10.0million, with the aggregate amount of those commitments totaling approximately $180.0million. the largest of those commitments to one borrowing relationship was $27.3million, which is 16.1% of our consolidated shareholders equity. given the size of these loan relationships relative to our capital levels and earnings, a significant loss on any one of these loans could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.the unexpected loss of key officers may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. our success depends significantly on our executive officers, especially john w. allison, ron w. strother, randy e. mayor, and on the presidents of our bank subsidiaries. our bank subsidiaries, in particular, rely heavily on their management teams relationships in their local communities to generate business. because we do not have employment agreements or non-compete agreements with our employees, our executive officers and bank presidents are free to resign at any time and accept an employment offer from another company, including a competitor. the loss of services from a member of our current management team may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.our growth and expansion strategy may not be successful and our market value and profitability may suffer. growth through the acquisition of banks, de novo branching, and the organization of new banks represents an important component of our business strategy. although we have no present plans to acquire any financial institution or financial services provider, any future acquisitions we might make will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. these risks include, among other things: credit risk associated with the acquired banks loans and investments; difficulty of integrating operations and personnel;and potential disruption of our ongoing business. we expect that competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant. we may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources. we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions. in addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, we plan to continue de novo branching, and we may consider the organization of new banks in new market areas. we do not, however, have any current plans to organize a new bank. de novo branching and any acquisition or organization of a new bank carries with it numerous risks, including the following: the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals; significant costs and anticipated operating losses associated with establishing a de novo branch or a new bank; the inability to secure the services of qualified senior management; the local market may not accept the services of a new bank owned and managed by a bank holding company headquartered outside of the market area of the new bank; the inability to obtain attractive locations within a new market at a reasonable cost;and the additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls. we cannot assure that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions, de novo branching and the organization of new banks. our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value and profitability. we expect to continue to grow our assets and deposits, the products and services we offer, and the scale of our operations, generally, both internally and through acquisitions. if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to control costs and maintain our asset quality. our ability to manage our growth successfully will depend on our ability to maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms. if we grow too quickly and are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, this rapid growth could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.there may be undiscovered risks or losses associated with our acquisitions of bank subsidiaries which would have a negative impact upon our future income. our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions of bank subsidiaries. we acquired three bank subsidiaries in 2005, and will continue to consider strategic acquisitions, with a primary focus on arkansas and southwestern florida. in most cases, our acquisition of a bank includes the acquisition of all of the target banks assets and liabilities, including its loan portfolio. there may be instances when we, under our normal operating procedures, may find after the acquisition that there may be additional losses or undisclosed liabilities with respect to the assets and liabilities of the target bank, and, with respect to its loan portfolio, that the ability of a borrower to repay a loan may have become impaired, the quality of the value of the collateral securing a loan may fall below our standards, or the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate. one or more of these factors might cause us to have additional losses or liabilities, additional loan charge-offs, or increases in allowances for loan losses, which would have a negative impact upon our future income.an economic downturn, natural disaster or act of terrorism, especially one affecting our market areas, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. our business is affected by prevailing economic conditions in the united states, including inflation and unemployment rates, but is particularly subject to the local economies in arkansas, the florida keys and southwestern florida. our relatively small size and our geographic concentration expose us to greater risk of unfavorable local economic conditions than the larger national or regional banks in our market areas. adverse changes in local economic factors, such as population growth trends, income levels, deposits and housing starts, may adversely affect our operations. we are at risk of natural disaster or acts of terrorism, even if our market areas are not primarily affected. our florida market, in particular, is subject to risks from hurricanes, which may damage or dislocate our facilities, damage or destroy collateral, adversely affect the livelihood of borrowers or otherwise cause significant economic dislocation in areas we serve. if and when economic conditions deteriorate, either in our local market areas or nationwide, we may experience a reduction in the demand for our products and services and deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio and consequently have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect our profitability. the banking business is highly competitive. we experience strong competition, not only from commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions, but also from mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other financial institutions operating in or near our market areas. we compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans.many of our competitors are much larger national and regional financial institutions. we may face a competitive disadvantage against them as a result of our smaller size and resources and our lack of geographic diversification. we also compete against community banks that have strong local ties. these smaller institutions are likely to cater to the same small and mid-sized businesses that we target and to use a relationship-based approach similar to ours. in addition, our competitors may seek to gain market share by pricing below the current market rates for loans and paying higher rates for deposits. competitive pressures can adversely affect our profitability.our recent results do not indicate our future results, and may not provide guidance to assess the risk of an investment in our common stock. we are unlikely to sustain our historical rate of growth, and may not even be able to expand our business at all. further, our recent growth may distort some of our historical financial ratios and statistics. in the future, we may not have the benefit of several recently favorable factors, such as a strong residential housing market or the ability to find suitable expansion opportunities. various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence. if we are not able to successfully grow our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.we may not be able to raise the additional capital we need to grow and, as a result, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired. federal and state regulatory authorities require us and our bank subsidiaries to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. while we believe that our capital will be sufficient to support our current operations and anticipated expansion, factors such as faster than anticipated growth, reduced earning levels, operating losses, changes in economic conditions, revisions in regulatory requirements, or additional acquisition opportunities may lead us to seek additional capital. our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance and on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control. if we need additional capital but cannot raise it on terms acceptable to us, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired.we are considered by the federal reserve board to be a source of financial strength for white river bancshares and may be required to support its capital. we hold a 20% ownership interest in white river bancshares, inc., a bank holding company headquartered in fayetteville, arkansas. our minority ownership means that we lack effective power to control the operations of the holding company. we are, nevertheless, considered by the federal reserve board to be a source of financial strength for that holding company. as a result, we may be required to contribute sufficient funds for white river bancshares to meet regulatory capital requirements if it is unable to raise funds from other sources. an obligation to support white river bancshares may be required at times when, in the absence of this federal reserve board policy, we might not be inclined to provide it. as of and for the year ended december31, 2005, white river bancshares had total assets of $184.7million, total shareholders equity of $51.2million, and a net operating loss of $2.7million. the capital ratios for white river bancshares wholly-owned bank subsidiary, signature bank of arkansas, at year-end and the minimum ratios required to be considered well capitalized were: leverage ratio, 24.7% (5.0% required); tier1 capital ratio, 27.8% (6.0% required); and total risk-based capital ratio, 29.0% (10.0% required). we may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on our common stock. although we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock since the second quarter of 2003 and expect to continue this practice, we cannot assure you of our ability to continue. our ability to pay dividends depends on the following factors, among others: we may not have sufficient earnings since our primary source of income, the payment of dividends to us by our bank subsidiaries, is subject to federal and state laws that limit the ability of these banks to pay dividends. federal reserve board policy requires bank holding companies to pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs and financial condition. before dividends may be paid on our common stock in any year, dividends of $0.25per share must first be paid on our classa preferred stock and $0.57per share on our classb preferred stock. before dividends may be paid on our common stock in any year, payments must be made on our subordinated debentures. our board of directors may determine that, even though funds are available for dividend payments, retaining the funds for internal uses, such as expansion of our operations, is a better strategy. if we fail to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be your sole opportunity for gains on your investment.our directors and executive officers own a significant portion of our common stock and can exert significant control over our business and corporate affairs. our directors and executive officers, as a group, will beneficially own approximately 38.6% of our common stock immediately following this offering. consequently, if they vote their shares in concert, they can significantly influence the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors. the interests of our officers and directors may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock, and they may take actions affecting our company with which you disagree.the holders of our subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders. we have $44.8million of subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities. payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are unconditionally guaranteed by us. the subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock. as a result, we must make payments on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock. we have the right to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock. risks related to our industryour profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and monetary policy. most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, and thus subject us to significant risks from changes in interest rates. consequently, our results of operations can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and our ability to manage interest rate risk. changes in market interest rates, or changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates, or changes in the relationship between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. this difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income or a decrease in interest rate spread. in addition to affecting our profitability, changes in interest rates can impact the valuation of our assets and liabilities.as of march31, 2006, our one-year ratio of interest-rate-sensitive assets to interest-rate-sensitive liabilities was 104.1% and our cumulative gap position was 2.3% of total earning assets, resulting in a minimum impact on earnings for various interest rate change scenarios. floating rate loans made up 39.1% of our $1.2billion loan portfolio. in addition, 70.7% of our loans receivable and 81.3% of our time deposits were scheduled to reprice within 12months and our other rate sensitive asset and rate sensitive liabilities composition is subject to change. significant composition changes in our rate sensitive assets or liabilities could result in a more unbalanced position and interest rate changes would have more of an impact to our earnings. our results of operations are also affected by the monetary policies of the federal reserve board. actions by the federal reserve board involving monetary policies could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand or business and earnings.we are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business, which limitations or restrictions could adversely affect our profitability. we are a registered financial holding company primarily regulated by the federal reserve board. our bank subsidiaries are also primarily regulated by the federal reserve board, the federal deposit insurance corporation, and the arkansas state bank department or florida office of financial regulation. complying with banking industry regulations is costly and may limit our growth and restrict certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. we are also subject to capital requirements by our regulators. violations of various laws, even if unintentional, may result in significant fines or other penalties, including restrictions on branching or bank acquisitions. recently, banks generally have faced increased regulatory sanctions and scrutiny, particularly under the usa patriot act and statutes that promote customer privacy or seek to prevent money laundering. as regulation of the banking industry continues to evolve, we expect the costs of compliance to continue to increase and, thus, to affect our ability to operate profitably. upon completion of this offering, we will become subject to the many requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq. these laws and regulations will increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. although we are accustomed to conducting business in a highly regulated environment, these laws and regulations have different requirements for compliance than we have previously experienced. our expenses for accounting, legal and consulting services will increase because of the new obligations we will face as a public company. in addition, the sudden application of these requirements to our business will result in some cultural adjustments and may strain our management resources. to date, we have not conducted a comprehensive review and confirmation of the adequacy of our existing systems and controls as will be required under section404 of the sarbanes-oxley act, and will not do so until after the completion of this offering. we may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. if that is the case, we intend to take the necessary steps to correct any deficiencies. these steps may be costly and strain our resources. a decline in the market price for our common stock may result if we are unable to comply with the sarbanes-oxley act. risks related to this offeringwe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering, and our use of those proceeds may not yield a favorable return on your investment. we will use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, our working capital needs and providing investments in our bank subsidiaries. we may also use the net proceeds to finance bank acquisitions, though we have no present plans in that regard. thus, ourmanagement has broad discretion over how these proceeds are used and could spend the proceeds in ways with which you may not agree. we may not invest the proceeds of this offering effectively or in a manner that yields a favorable (or any) return on our common stock, and consequently, this could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business or cause the price of our common stock to decline.there has been no prior active trading market for our common stock. we cannot assure you that an active public trading market will develop after the offering and, even if it does, our stock price may trade below the public offering price. there has been no public market for our common stock prior to this offering. an active trading market for our common stock may never develop or be sustained, which could affect your ability to sell your shares. even if a market develops for our common stock after the offering, the market price of our common stock may experience significant volatility. factors that may affect the price of our common stock include the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, investor perception of our financial strength, conditions in the banking industry such as credit quality and monetary policies, and general economic and market conditions. our quarterly operating results, changes in analysts earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or financial markets or other developments affecting us could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. in addition, the initial public offering price has been determined through negotiations between us and the underwriters, and may bear no relationship to the price at which the common stock will trade upon completion of the offering.investors in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution. purchasers in this offering will experience immediate dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price and the net tangible book value per share of our common stock. this dilution is estimated to be $8.36 per share, based on the initial offering price of $18.00 per share and our pro forma net tangible book value of $9.64per share as of march31, 2006. this per-share dilution takes into account the conversion to common stock of our outstanding shares of classa preferred stock and classb preferred stock, as it is our intent to effect those conversions as soon as practicable after the offering is completed. to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities in the future, our shareholders may experience additional dilution. our board of directors may determine, from time to time, a need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other securities. we may issue additional securities at prices or on terms less favorable than or equal to the public offering price and terms of this offering.the ability of our insiders or the holders of our classa and classb preferred stock to sell substantial amounts of common stock after this offering may depress the market price of our common stock or cause it to decline. there are three potentially significant sources of shares of our common stock that may come on the market after this offering: our directors and executive officers will beneficially own approximately 38.6% of our common stock immediately after this offering. although they are subject to lock-up agreements with our underwriters, which generally prevent them from selling their shares within 180days after the offering, the underwriters may release them from those obligations. in any event, after the lock-up agreements expire, approximately 6.7million additional shares of our common stock could become tradable by our directors and executive officers. we intend to require that all of the outstanding shares of our classa preferred stock be converted to common stock as soon as practicable after june6, 2006, the first date on which we can require conversion of those shares. we also intend, as soon as practicable after this offering, to require that our classb preferred stock be converted to common stock. conversion of our classa preferred stock and classb preferred stock will result in approximately 2,159,921shares of our common stock being issued. approximately 80,720additional shares of our common stock may be issued upon exercise of outstanding preferred stock options and the subsequent conversion to common stock of the preferred shares issued. most of the holders of the newly issued shares of common stock will be eligible immediately to sell their shares. we intend to register all common stock that we may issue upon exercise of outstanding options under our 2006 stock option and performance incentive plan. once we register these shares, they can be sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws and, if applicable, the lock-up agreements described above. as of march31, 2006, stock options to purchase968,244shares of our common stock had been granted under this plan, of which 481,224 are presently exercisable. sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock after this offering, or the expectation that these sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.</td>

      <td>risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in such case, you may lose all or part of your original investment. risks relating to our businessmany of the products we manufacture or purchase and resell are commodities whose price is determined by the market's supply and demand for such products, and the markets in which we operate are cyclical and competitive. the depressed state of the housing, construction and home improvement markets could continue to adversely affect demand and pricing for our products. many of the building products we produce or distribute, including osb, plywood, lumber and particleboard, are commodities that are widely available from other manufacturers or distributors with prices and volumes determined frequently in an auction market, based on participants' perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors. at times, the price for any one or more of the products we produce may fall below our cash production costs, requiring us to either incur short-term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities. therefore, our profitability with respect to these commodity products depends, in significant part, on managing our cost structure, particularly raw materials and labor, which represent the largest components of our operating costs. commodity wood product prices could be volatile in response to operating rates and inventory levels in various distribution channels. commodity price volatility affects our distribution business, with falling price environments generally causing reduced revenues and margins, resulting in substantial declines in profitability and possible net losses. historically, demand for the products we manufacture, as well as the products we purchase and distribute, has been closely correlated with new residential construction in the united states and, to a lesser extent, light commercial construction and residential repair and remodeling activity. new residential construction activity remained substantially below average historical levels during 2012 and so did demand for many of the products we manufacture and distribute. there is significant uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of any recovery in such construction activity and resulting product demand levels. demand for new residential construction is influenced by seasonal weather factors, mortgage availability and rates, unemployment levels, household formation rates, domestic population growth, immigration rates, residential vacancy and foreclosure rates, demand for second homes, existing home prices, consumer confidence and other general economic factors. wood products industry supply is influenced primarily by price-induced changes in the operating rates of existing facilities but is also influenced over time by the introduction of new product technologies, capacity additions and closures, restart of idled capacity and log availability. the balance of wood products supply and demand in the united states is also heavily influenced by imported products, principally from canada. we have very limited control of the foregoing, and as a result, our profitability and cash flow may fluctuate materially in response to changes in the supply and demand balance for our primary products.our industry is highly competitive. if we are unable to compete effectively, our sales, operating results and growth strategies could be negatively affected. the markets for the products we manufacture in our wood products segment are highly competitive. our competitors range from very large, fully integrated forest and building products firms to smaller firms that may manufacture only one or a few types of products. we also compete less directly with firms that manufacture substitutes for wood building products. certain mills operated by our competitors may be lower-cost manufacturers than the mills operated by us. the building products distribution industry that our building materials distribution segment competes in is highly fragmented and competitive, and the barriers to entry for local competitors are relatively low. competitive factors in our industry include pricing and availability of product, service and delivery capabilities, ability to assist customers with problem solving, customer relationships, geographic coverage and breadth of product offerings. also, financial stability is important to suppliers and customers in choosing distributors and allows for more favorable terms on which to obtain products from suppliers and sell products to customers. if our financial condition deteriorates in the future, our support from suppliers may be negatively affected. some of our competitors are larger companies and, therefore, have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. these resources may afford those competitors greater purchasing power, increased financial flexibility and more capital resources for expansion and improvement, which may enable those competitors to compete more effectively than we can.our manufacturing businesses may have difficulty obtaining wood fiber at favorable prices or at all. wood fiber is our principal raw material, which accounted for approximately 43% of the aggregate amount of materials, labor and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation), for our wood products segment in 2012. wood fiber is a commodity and prices have been cyclical historically in response to changes in domestic and foreign demand and supply. foreign demand for timber exports, particularly from china, increased timber costs in the western u.s. in 2010 and 2011 and negatively affected wood products manufacturers in the region. in 2012, china's demand for timber exports from the western u.s. declined from 2011 levels, but in the future we expect that the level of foreign demand for timber exports from the western u.s. will continue to fluctuate based on the economic activity in china and other pacific rim countries, currency exchange rates and the availability of timber supplies from other countries such as canada, russia and new zealand. sustained periods of high timber costs may impair the cost competitiveness of our manufacturing facilities. we currently enjoy the benefit of supply agreements put in place in 2005 following the sale of our timberlands (or successor arrangements), under which we purchase timber at market based prices. for 2012, approximately 33% of our timber was supplied pursuant to agreements assumed by (or replacement master supply agreements with) hancock natural resource group,inc. ("hancock"), the molpus woodlands groupllc ("molpus") and rayonier louisiana timberlands,llc, a timberland real estate investment trust ("rayonier"). the supply agreements with these parties terminate on december31, 2014, subject to additional one-year extensions unless notice is provided to the other party at least six months prior to expiration of the applicable agreement. if a counterparty to these agreements elects not to continue these agreements or we are unable to renegotiate these agreements on terms that are acceptable to us, we would need to locate a replacement supplier for our timber requirements, which could include private purchases with other suppliers, open-market purchases and purchases from governmental sources. if we are unable to locate a replacement supplier in a particular region to satisfy our timber needs at satisfactory prices, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. in 2012, we purchased approximately 21% of our timber from federal, state and local governments. in certain regions in which we operate, a substantial portion of our timber is purchased from governmental authorities. as a result, existing and future governmental regulation can affect our access to, and the cost of, such timber. future domestic or foreign legislation and litigation concerning the use of timberlands, timber harvest methodologies, forest road construction and maintenance, the protection of endangered species, forest-based carbon sequestration, the promotion of forest health and the response to and prevention of catastrophic wildfires can affect timber and fiber supply from both government and private lands. availability of harvested timber and fiber may be further limited by fire, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, windstorms, hurricanes, flooding and other natural and man-made causes, thereby reducing supply and increasing prices. availability of residual wood fiber for our particleboard operation has been negatively affected by significant mill closures and curtailments that have occurred among solid-wood product manufacturers. future development of wood cellulose biofuel or other new sources of wood fiber demand could interfere with our ability to source wood fiber or lead to significantly higher costs.significant changes in discount rates, actual investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect our earnings, equity and pension contributions in future periods. our earnings may be negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension plans. gaap requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. these valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. the most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension expense are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. in addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to "accumulated other comprehensive loss." a decline in the market value of the pension assets will increase our funding requirements. our pension plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension plans. at december31, 2012, the net underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans was $192.5million. if the status of our defined benefit plans continues to be underfunded, we anticipate significant future funding obligations, reducing the cash available for our business. for more discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan estimates, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimatespensions."our recent significant capital investments have increased fixed costs, which could negatively affect our profitability. in the past three years, we have completed a number of capital investments, including significantly increasing our outdoor storage acreage and leasing additional warehouse space. in the future, we expect to make further capital investments, primarily related to internal veneer production. these significant capital investments have resulted in increased fixed costs, which could negatively affect our profitability if the housing market does not recover and revenues do not improve to offset our incremental fixed costs.a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, including the demand from our building materials distribution business, reduce our sales, and/or negatively affect our financial results. any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including but not limited to: equipment failure, particularly a press at one of our major ewp production facilities; fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes; unscheduled maintenance outages; utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions; labor difficulties; other operational problems; or ecoterrorism or threats of ecoterrorism. any downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. if our machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to satisfy customer requirements would be impaired, resulting in lower sales and net income. because approximately 39% of our wood products sales in the ltm period, including approximately 73% of our ewp sales, were to our building materials distribution business, a material disruption at our wood products facilities would also negatively impact our building materials distribution business. we are therefore exposed to a larger extent to the risk of disruption to our wood products manufacturing facilities due to our vertical integration and the resulting impact on our building materials distribution business. in addition, a number of our suppliers are subject to the manufacturing facility disruption risks noted above. our suppliers' inability to produce the necessary raw materials for our manufacturing processes or supply the finished goods that we distribute through our building materials distribution segment may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.adverse conditions may increase the credit risk from our customers. our building materials distribution and wood products segments extend credit to numerous customers who are heavily exposed to the effects of downturns in the housing market. unfavorable housing market conditions could result in financial failures of one or more of our significant customers, which could impair our ability to fully collect receivables from such customers and negatively affect our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.a significant portion of our sales are concentrated with a relatively small number of customers. for the year ended december31, 2012, our top ten customers represented approximately 29% of our sales, with one customer accounting for approximately 11% of sales. at december31, 2012 and june30, 2013, receivables from such customer accounted for approximately 14% and 16%, respectively, of total receivables. although we believe that our relationships with our customers are strong, the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.our ability to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs is subject to various risks. our ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness and fund other liquidity needs depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets as well as the other risks described herein. in particular, demand for our products correlates to a significant degree to the level of residential construction activity in north america, which historically has been characterized by significant cyclicality. over the last several years, housing starts remained below historical levels. this reduced level of building was caused, in part, by an increase in the inventory of homes for sale, a more restrictive mortgage market, and a slowed economy. there can be no assurance as to when or if the housing market will rebound to historical levels. we have experienced significant losses from operations and used significant cash for operating activities in recent periods. we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. if we are unable to service our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we could be forced to curtail our operations, reorganize our capital structure, or liquidate some or all of our assets.we are subject to environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures, as well as other potential environmental liabilities. our businesses are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific environmental laws and regulations, particularly with respect to air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management and site remediation. enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, including those aimed at addressing greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant expenditures or restrict operations. from time to time, legislative bodies and environmental regulatory agencies may promulgate new regulatory programs imposing significant incremental operating costs or capital costs on us. in december 2012, the u.s. environmental protection agency (the "epa") finalized a revised series of four regulations commonly referred to collectively as boiler mact, which are intended to regulate the emission of hazardous air pollutants from industrial boilers. facilities in our wood products segment will be subject to one or more of these regulations and must be in compliance with the applicable rules by early 2016. we are currently undertaking a complete review of the revised rules to assess how they will affect our operations. even with the revised rules finalized, considerable uncertainty still exists, as there will likely be legal challenges to the final rules from industry and/or environmental organizations. notwithstanding that uncertainty, we are proceeding with efforts to analyze the applicability and requirements of the regulations, including the capital and operating costs required to comply. at this time, we cannot accurately forecast the capital or operating cost changes that may result from compliance with the regulations. as an owner and operator of real estate, we may be liable under environmental laws for the cleanup of past and present spills and releases of hazardous or toxic substances on or from our properties and operations. we could be found liable under these laws whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such substances. in some cases, this liability may exceed the value of the property itself. we may be unable to generate funds or other sources of liquidity and capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures to the extent we are not indemnified by third parties. for example, in connection with the completion of our acquisition of the forest products and paper assets of officemax in 2004 (the "forest products acquisition"), officemax is generally obligated to indemnify us for hazardous substance releases and other environmental violations that occurred prior to the forest products acquisition. however, officemax may not have sufficient funds to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations when required, and in some cases, we may not be contractually entitled to indemnification by officemax. in addition, in connection with the sale of our paper and packaging&amp; newsprint assets in 2008, boiseinc. and its affiliates assumed any and all environmental liabilities arising from our ownership or operation of the assets and businesses sold to them, and we believe we are entitled to indemnification by them from third-party claims in the event they fail to fully discharge any such liabilities on the basis of common law rules of indemnification. however, boiseinc. may not have sufficient funds to discharge its obligations when required or to indemnify us from third-party claims arising out of any such failure. for additional information on how environmental regulation and compliance affects our business, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsenvironmental." labor disruptions or increased labor costs could adversely affect our business. as of october13, 2013, we had approximately 5,210 employees. approximately 27% of these employees work pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. as of october13, 2013, we had nine collective bargaining agreements. two agreements, covering 375 employees at our facility in florien, louisiana, and 283 employees at our facility in oakdale, louisiana, expired on july15, 2013 but have been indefinitely extended by the parties, subject to either party submitting a ten-day written notice to terminate. we expect these two agreements to be negotiated together. if these agreements are not renewed or extended upon their expiration, we could experience a material labor disruption or significantly increased labor costs, which could prevent us from meeting customer demand or reduce our sales and profitability.if our long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record noncash impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations. we review the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. should the markets for our products deteriorate further or should we decide to invest capital differently than as expected, or should other cash flow assumptions change, it is possible that we will be required to record noncash impairment charges in the future with respect to the investments we have completed and expect to complete, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes restrict, and covenants contained in agreements governing indebtedness in the future may restrict, our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies. our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes contain, and any future indebtedness of ours may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose customary operating and financial restrictions on us. our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, among other things, to: incur additional debt; declare or pay dividends, redeem stock, or make other distributions to stockholders; make investments; create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; sell or transfer certain assets; and make prepayments on our senior notes and subordinated indebtedness. in addition, our revolving credit facility provides that if an event of default occurs or excess availability under our revolving credit facility drops below a threshold amount equal to the greater of 10% of the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility or $35million (and until such time as excess availability for two consecutive fiscal months exceeds that threshold amount and no event of default has occurred and is continuing), we will be required to maintain a monthly minimum fixed coverage charge ratio of 1.0:1.0, determined on a trailing twelve-month basis. our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees. our key managers are important to our success and may be difficult to replace because they have an average of 30years of experience in forest products manufacturing and building materials distribution. while our senior management team has considerable experience, certain members of our management team are nearing or have reached normal retirement age. the failure to successfully implement succession plans could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or inadequate skill sets, which could adversely affect our business.our growth strategy includes pursuing strategic acquisitions. we may be unable to integrate efficiently acquired operations or complete successfully potential acquisitions. we may not be able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses, including chester wood productsllc and moncure plywoodllc, in an efficient and cost-effective manner or without significant disruption to our existing operations or realize expected synergies. acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including uncertainties as to the future financial performance of the acquired business, difficulties integrating acquired personnel into our business, the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers, difficulties in integrating different computer and accounting systems, exposure to unknown or unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, and the diversion of management attention and resources from existing operations. in the future, we may be unable to complete successfully potential acquisitions due to multiple factors, such as issues related to regulatory review of the proposed transactions. we may also be required to incur additional debt in order to consummate acquisitions, which debt may be substantial and may limit our flexibility in using our cash flow from operations. our failure to integrate future acquired businesses effectively or to manage other consequences of our acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.we rely on boiseinc. for many of our administrative services. in conjunction with the sale of our paper and packaging&amp; newsprint assets in 2008, we entered into an outsourcing services agreement, under which boiseinc. provides a number of corporate staff services to us. these services include information technology, accounting and human resource transactional services. most of the boiseinc. staff that provides these services are providing the same services they provided when they were our employees. on october25, 2013, packaging corporation of america ("pca") acquired all of the outstanding common shares of boiseinc. the outsourcing services agreement remains in place after pca's acquisition of boiseinc. and is currently set to expire on february22, 2015. we cannot be assured that the staff providing such services will remain with pca after the acquisition, or that there will not be a disruption in the continuity or level of service provided. if pca is unwilling or unable to provide services at the same quality levels as those services have been provided in the past, or we are unable to develop and implement effective alternatives, if necessary, our business and compliance activities and results of operations could be substantially and negatively affected. risks relating to ownership of our common stockthe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them. the market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including: our operating and financial performance and prospects; our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry; the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the sec; changes in, or failure to meet, earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other companies in our industry; the failure of research analysts to cover our common stock; general economic, industry and market conditions; strategic actions by us, our customers or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; material litigation or government investigations; changes in general conditions in the u.s. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events; changes in key personnel; sales of common stock by us, our principal stockholder or members of our management team; termination of lock-up agreements with our management team and principal stockholder; the granting or exercise of employee stock options; volume of trading in our common stock; and the impact of the facts described elsewhere in "risk factors." in addition, in recent years, the stock market has regularly experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.the requirements of being a public company have increased certain of our costs and require significant management focus. we completed our initial public offering in february 2013 and boise cascade common stock is listed on the nyse. as a public company, our legal, accounting and other expenses associated with compliance-related and other activities have increased. for example, in connection with our initial public offering, we created new board committees and appointed an additional independent director to comply with the corporate governance requirements of the nyse. costs to obtain director and officer liability insurance contribute to our increased costs. as a result of the associated liability, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt even more changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase our compliance costs. until certain applicable phase-in periods expire, we are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements since we were a "controlled company" within the meaning of the nyse rules and, as a result, you will not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements. until july30, 2013, when bc holdings ceased to hold a majority of our common stock, we were considered a "controlled company" for the purposes of the nyse listing requirements. under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by a group is a "controlled company" and may elect not to comply with certain nyse corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that our board of directors, our compensation committee and our corporate governance and nominating committee meet the standard of independence established by those corporate governance requirements. we have one year from the date we ceased to be a controlled company to fully comply with all of nyse's corporate governance requirements. accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse's corporate governance requirements until the applicable phase-in periods expire.our significant stockholder, bc holdings, has the ability to influence corporate activities and its interests may not coincide with yours. after the consummation of this offering, bc holdings will beneficially own approximately 22.4% of our outstanding common stock, assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional shares. if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, bc holdings will beneficially own approximately 19.8% of our outstanding common stock. as a result of its ownership, bc holdings (and madison dearborn as its indirect controlling equityholder) has the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and, through our board of directors, the ability to influence decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies. matters over which bc holdings, directly or indirectly, has the ability to influence decision-making include: election of directors; mergers and other business combination transactions, including proposed transact</td>

      <td>RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the remainder of this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are intended to highlight risks that are specific to us and are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, such as those that generally apply to business enterprises in our industry, also may impair our business operations. Our future profitability is uncertain due to our limited operating historyWe have a limited operating history and cannot assure you that our revenue will continue to grow or that we will maintain profitability in the future. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies in the early stages of development. We rely substantially on sales of our MeetingPlace products, which have limited market acceptanceIn addition, we are unable to predict our future product development, sales and marketing, and administrative expenses. To the extent that these expenses increase, we will need to increase revenue to sustain profitability. Our ability to increase revenue and sustain profitability also depends on the other risk factors described in this section. Our operating results may fluctuate significantlyOur operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock would likely decline. The factors that may cause fluctuations of our operating results include the following: . changes in our mix of revenues generated from product sales and services; . changes by existing customers in their levels of purchases of our products and services; . changes in our mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold; and . changes in our mix of domestic and international salesOrders at the beginning of each quarter typically do not equal expected revenue for that quarter. In addition, a significant portion of our orders are received in the last month of each fiscal quarter. If we fail to ship products by the end of a quarter in which the order is received, or if our prospective customers delay their orders or delivery schedules until the following quarter, we may fail to meet our revenue objectives. 6 Our market is highly competitiveBecause of intense market competition, we may not be successful. Currently, our principal competitors include: . major telecommunications carriers that operate service bureaus for voice conferencing, such as AT&amp;T Corp., MCI Worldcom, Inc. and Sprint Corporation; . private branch exchange, or PBX, vendors that sell systems with voice conferencing capabilities, such as Lucent Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks; . providers of video conferencing systems such as PictureTel Corporation, Pinnacle Systems, Inc. and 8x8, Inc.; and . smaller start-up companies that offer web-based voice and data conferencing productsMany of these companies have longer operating histories, stronger brand names and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. These companies also may have existing relationships with many of our prospective customers. In addition, these companies may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirementsIn addition, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future which could adversely affect our ability to increase sales, penetrate new markets and maintain average selling prices. In the future, we may experience competition from potential competitors that include: . networking companies, such as Cisco Systems, Inc., 3Com Corporation, Lucent Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks that are focusing on enabling the transmission of voice over the Internet and that may offer voice and data conferencing functionality; and . collaborative software providers, such as Microsoft Corporation and Lotus Development Corporation, that are focusing on data conferencing products and that may in the future incorporate voice conferencing functionality into their products. Our market is in an early stage of development, and our products may not be adoptedIf the market for our integrated voice and data conferencing products fails to grow or grows more slowly than we anticipate, we may not be able to increase revenues or remain profitable. The market for integrated real-time voice and data conferencing is relatively new and rapidly evolving. Our ability to remain profitable depends in large part on the widespread adoption by end users of real-time voice and data conferencingWe will have to devote substantial resources to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products. In addition, businesses that have invested substantial resources in other conferencing products may be reluctant or slow to adopt our products, which might replace or compete with their existing systems. Our efforts to educate potential customers may not result in our products achieving market acceptance. 7 Rapid technological changes could cause our products to become obsolete or require us to redesign our productsThe market in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards. In particular, we expect that the growth of the Internet and Internet-based telephony applications, as well as general technology trends such as migrations to new operating systems, will require us to adapt our product to remain competitive. This adaptation could be costly and time-consuming. Our products could become obsolete and unmarketable if products using new technologies are introduced and new industry standards emerge. For example, the widespread acceptance of competing technologies, such as video conferencing and the transmission of voice over the Internet, could diminish demand for our current products. As a result, the life cycle of our products is difficult to estimateTo be successful, we will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards, such as the transmission of voice over the Internet, in a timely manner and on a cost effective basis. In addition, our current full care support agreements with our customers require us to deliver two product upgrades per year. We cannot assure you that we will successfully develop these types of products and product enhancements or that our products will achieve broad market acceptance. Our sales cycle is lengthy and unpredictableAny delay in sales of our products could cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. The typical sales cycle of our products is lengthy, generally between six to nine months, unpredictable, and involves significant investment decisions by prospective customers, as well as our education of potential customers regarding the use and benefits of our products. Furthermore, many of our prospective customers have neither budgeted expenses for voice and data conferencing systems nor have personnel specifically dedicated to procurement and implementation of these conferencing systems. As a result, our customers spend a substantial amount of time before purchasing our products in performing internal reviews and obtaining capital expenditure approvals. We cannot be certain that this cycle will not lengthen in the future. The emerging and evolving nature of the real-time voice and data conferencing market may lead to confusion in the market, which may cause prospective customers to postpone their purchase decisions. In addition, general concerns regarding Year 2000 compliance may further delay purchase decisions by prospective customers. If we fail to expand our sales and distribution channels, our business could sufferIf we are unable to expand our sales and distribution channels, we may not be able to increase revenue or achieve market acceptance of our MeetingPlace product. We have recently expanded our direct sales force and plan to recruit additional sales personnel. New sales personnel will require training and take time to achieve full productivity, and there is strong competition for qualified sales personnel in our business. In addition, we believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners. To date, we have entered into agreements with only a small number of these distribution partners. We cannot be certain that 8 we will be able to reach agreement with additional distribution partners on a timely basis or at all, or that these distribution partners will devote adequate resources to selling our products. Furthermore, if our distribution partners fail to adequately market or support our products, the reputation of our products in the market may suffer. In addition, we will need to manage potential conflicts between our direct sales force and third-party reselling efforts. Our ability to expand into international markets is uncertainWe intend to continue to expand our operations into new international markets. In addition to general risks associated with international expansion, such as foreign currency fluctuations and political and economic instability, we face the following risks and uncertainties any of which could prevent us from selling our products in a particular country or harm our business operations once we have established operations in that country: . the difficulties and costs of localizing products for foreign markets, including the development of multilingual capabilities in our MeetingPlace system; . the need to modify our products to comply with local telecommunications certification requirements in each country; and . our lack of a direct sales presence in other countries, our need to establish relationships with distribution partners to sell our products in these markets and our reliance on the capabilities and performance of these distribution partners. If we fail to integrate our products with third-party technology, our sales could sufferOur products are designed to integrate with our customers' data and voice networks, as well as with enterprise applications such as browsers and collaborative software applications. If we are unable to integrate our products with these networks and systems, sales of our products could suffer In addition, we may be required to engage in costly and time-consuming redesigns of our products because of technology enhancements or upgrades of these systems. We may not be able to redesign our products or be certain that any of these redesigns will achieve market acceptance. In addition, we will need to continually modify our products as newer versions of the enterprise applications with which our products integrate are introduced. Our ability to do so largely depends on our ability to gain access to the advanced programming interfaces for these applications, and we cannot assure you that we will have access to necessary advanced programming interfaces in the future. We may experience difficulties managing our expected growthOur recent growth has strained, and we expect that any future growth will continue to strain, our management systems and resources, which could hinder our ability to continue to grow in the future. We may also experience difficulties meeting the demand for our products and services. If we are unable to provide training and support for our products, the implementation process will be longer and customer satisfaction may be lowerWe may not be able to install management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner, and our current or planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be 9 adequate to support our future operations. Competition for qualified personnel in the San Francisco Bay area, as well as other markets in which we recruit, is extremely intense and characterized by rapidly increasing salaries, which may increase our operating expenses or hinder our ability to recruit qualified candidates. Our business could suffer if we lose the services of our current management teamOur future success depends on the ability of our management to operate effectively, both individually and as a group. If we were to lose the services of any of these key employees we may encounter difficulties finding qualified personnel to replace them In addition, three of our seven executive officers joined us during the past 12 months. Accordingly, our executive officers' ability to function effectively as a management team remains unproven. The loss of our right to use technology licensed to us by third parties could harm our businessWe license technology that is incorporated into our products from third parties, including digital signal processing algorithms and the MeetingPlace server's operating system and relational database. Any interruption in the supply or support of any licensed software could disrupt our operations and delay our sales, unless and until we can replace the functionality provided by this licensed software. Because our products incorporate software developed and maintained by third parties, we depend on these third parties to deliver and support reliable products, enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. Any interruption in supply of components from outside manufacturers and suppliers could hinder our ability to ship products in a timely mannerWe rely on third parties to obtain most of the components of the MeetingPlace server and integrate them with other standard components, such as the central processing unit and disk drives. If these third parties are no longer able to supply and assemble these components or are unable to do so in a timely manner, we may experience delays in shipping our products and have to invest resources in finding an alternative manufacturer or manufacture our products internallyIn addition, we obtain key hardware components, including the processors and digital signal processing devices used in the MeetingPlace server, from sole source suppliers. In the past, we have experienced problems in obtaining some of these components in a timely manner from these sources, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to obtain an adequate supply of these components in a timely manner or, if necessary, from alternative sources. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components or to locate alternative sources of supply, we may experience delays in shipping our products and incur additional costs to find an alternative manufacturer or manufacture our products internally. Our products may suffer from defects, errors or breaches of securitySoftware and hardware products as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Any errors or defects 10 that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our customer relationships or reputation or increased service and warranty cost. Our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun, and we are aware of instances in which some of our customers have experienced product failures or errorsMany of our customers conduct confidential conferences, and transmit confidential data, using MeetingPlace. Concerns over the security of information sent over the Internet and the privacy of its users may inhibit the market acceptance of our products. In addition, unauthorized users in the past have gained, and in the future may be able to gain, access to our customers' MeetingPlace systems. Any compromise of security could deter people from using MeetingPlace and could harm our reputation and business and result in claims against us. We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, and we may be subject to infringement claimsUnauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, which could cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States In the future, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement of third party proprietary rights. Any of these claims, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, divert management's attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us. Parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could prevent us from selling our productsDell Computer Corporation has registered the "Latitude" mark for computers in the United States and in other countries. Dell's United States trademark registration and Canadian application have blocked our ability to register the "Latitude Communications" and "Latitude" with logo marks in the United States and the "Latitude Communications" mark in Canada. Since we believe that we have priority of trade name usage in the United States, we have petitioned to cancel Dell's United States registration and opposed its Canadian application. The outcome of these proceedings is uncertain. If Dell's registration for the "Latitude" mark is not canceled or if we are unable to obtain consent from Dell for our registration of our marks, we may not be able to register our marks and would have to rely solely on common law protection for these marks. We cannot assure you that we will be free from challenges of or obstacles to our use or registration of our marks. We are subject to government regulation, and our failure to comply with these regulations could harm our businessOur products are subject to a wide variety of safety, emissions and compatibility regulations imposed by governmental authorities in the United States or in other countries in which we sell our products. If we are unable to obtain necessary approvals or maintain compliance with the regulations of any particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from selling our products in that territory. In addition, to sell our products in many international markets, we are required to obtain certifications that are specific to the local telephony infrastructure. 11 We may be subject to claims related to Year 2000 issues, and Year 2000 concerns could adversely affect our revenuesMany currently installed computer systems are not capable of distinguishing 21st century dates from 20th century dates. As a result, beginning on January 1, 2000, computer systems and software used by many companies and organizations in a wide variety of industries, including technology, transportation, utilities, finance and telecommunications, will produce erroneous results or fail unless they have been modified or upgraded to process date information correctly. Year 2000 compliance efforts may involve significant time and expense, and uncorrected problems could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may face claims based on Year 2000 issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system. We may also experience reduced sales of our products as potential customers reduce their budgets for voice and data conferencing products due to increased expenditures on their own Year 2000 compliance efforts. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure." Our stock price may be volatileWe expect that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results. These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low. In addition, due to the technology-intensive and emerging nature of our business, the market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to: . announcements of technological or competitive developments; . acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors; or . the gain or loss by us of significant orders. Our executive officers and directors and their affiliates own a large percentage of our voting stock and could control the voting power of the common stockOn completion of this offering, executive officers and directors and their affiliates will beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 58% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent transactions that would result in the change of control, which in turn could reduce the market price of our common stock. Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock priceAfter this offering, we will have outstanding 18,581,657 shares of common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market following this offering could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. All the shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable. Upon the expiration of arrangements between our stockholders and Latitude or the underwriters in which our stockholders have agreed not to sell or dispose of their Latitude common stock, all of the remaining 15,581,657 shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be eligible for sale in the public market 180 days following the date of this prospectus. Of these shares, 11,682,572 shares will be subject to volume limitations under federal securities laws. 12 If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could fall.

      <td>risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be harmed. in these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our financial position and need for additional capitalwe have incurred significant losses since inception, expect to incur significant and increasing losses for at least the next several years, and may never achieve or maintain profitability. we have incurred significant annual net operating losses in every year since our inception. we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing net operating losses for at least the next several years. our net losses were $13.4million and $29.8million for the years ended december31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and $10.6million for the three months ended march31, 2016. as of march31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $64.1million. we have not generated any revenues from product sales, have not completed the development of any product candidate and may never have a product candidate approved for commercialization. we have financed our operations to date primarily through private placements of our preferred stock. we have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expense to support such research and development. our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders' (deficit) equity and working capital. we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we: continue to develop and begin clinical trials with respect to sy-1425, including a phase2 clinical trial we expect to initiate in mid-2016; continue to develop sy-1365, including initiating a phase 1/2 clinical trial in the first half of 2017; initiate and continue research, preclinical and clinical development efforts for our preclinical programs; further develop our gene control platform; seek to identify and develop additional product candidates; acquire or in-license other product candidates or technologies; seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; establish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure in the future to commercialize various products for which we may obtain marketing approval, if any; require the manufacture of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and, potentially, commercialization; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire and retain additional personnel, such as clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and help us comply with our obligations as a public company; and add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development programs. our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we are, or any future collaborator is, able to obtain marketing approval for, and successfully commercialize, one or more of our product candidates. successful commercialization will require achievement of key milestones, including initiating and successfully completing clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we, or any of our future collaborators, may obtain marketing approval, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payors. because of the uncertainties and risks associated with these activities, we are unable to accurately predict the timing and amount of revenues, and if or when we might achieve profitability. we and any future collaborators may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, or any future collaborators do, we may never generate revenues that are large enough for us to achieve profitability. even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our pipeline of product candidates or continue our operations and cause a decline in the value of our common stock.we have a limited operating history, no products approved for sale and no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability. we commenced operations in 2011. our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing our company, developing our gene control platform and conducting preclinical research. we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully conduct clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial-scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. accordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, especially clinical stage biopharmaceutical companies such as ours. any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known or unknown factors in achieving our business objectives. we will eventually need to transition from a company with a development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. we may not be successful in such a transition. we expect our financial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. accordingly, you should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or annual periods as indications of future operating performance.we will need substantial additional funding, and if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts. developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we initiate clinical trials of sy-1425, advance the development of sy-1365, initiate new research and preclinical development efforts and seek marketing approval for any product candidates that we successfully develop. moreover, under license agreements with various licensors, we are obligated to make milestone payments upon the successful completion of specified development and commercialization activities. in addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate that we may successfully develop, we may incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of a future collaborator. furthermore, following the closing of this offering, we expect to incur significant additional costs associated with operating as a public company. accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. if we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts. we plan to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to fund our ongoing research and development efforts. we will be required to expend significant funds in order to advance the development of sy-1425 and sy-1365, as well as our other preclinical programs. in addition, while we may seek one or more collaborators for future development of our current product candidate or any future product candidates that we may develop for one or more indications, we may not be able to enter into a collaboration for any of our product candidates for such indications on suitable terms, on a timely basis or at all. in any event, the net proceeds of this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund all of the efforts that we plan to undertake or to fund the completion of development of our product candidates or our other preclinical programs. accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources. we do not have any committed external source of funds. adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. we believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents as of march31, 2016, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through mid-2018. our estimate as to how long we expect the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, to be able to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. further, changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including: the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of sy-1425 and sy-1365; research and preclinical development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop; our ability to enter into and the terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements; the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements; the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; the costs of acquiring potential new product candidates or technology; the costs of any physician education programs relating to selecting and treating genomically defined patient populations; the timing and amount of milestone and other payments due to licensors for patent and technology rights used in our development platform; revenue received from commercial sales, if any, of our current and future product candidates; our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development and establish a commercial infrastructure; the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and the costs of operating as a public company.raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, including purchasers of common stock in this offering, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates. we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our planned operations. to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms of these securities could include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that could adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. in addition, debt financing, if available, would result in fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, creating liens, redeeming stock or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. in addition, securing financing could require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management's ability to oversee the development of our product candidates. if we raise additional funds through collaborations or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. risks related to the discovery, development and commercialization of product candidatesour approach to the discovery and development of product candidates based on our gene control platform is novel and unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any products of commercial value. we are focused on discovering and developing medicines for the treatment of cancer and other diseases based upon our gene control platform. we are leveraging our platform to create a pipeline of gene control drug candidates for genomically defined patients whose diseases have not been adequately addressed to date by other genomics approaches and to design and conduct efficient clinical trials with a higher likelihood of success. while we believe that applying our gene control platform to create medicines for genomically defined patient populations may potentially enable drug research and clinical development that is more efficient than conventional small molecule drug research and development, our approach is both novel and unproven. because our approach is both novel and unproven, the cost and time needed to develop our product candidates is difficult to predict, and our efforts may not result in the discovery and development of commercially viable medicines. we may also be incorrect about the effects of our product candidates on the diseases of genomically defined patient populations, which may limit the utility of our approach or the perception of the utility of our approach. furthermore, our estimates of genomically defined patient populations available for study and treatment may be lower than expected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct clinical trials and may also adversely affect the size of any market for medicines we may successfully commercialize. we have not yet succeeded and may never succeed in demonstrating efficacy and safety for our current or any future product candidates in clinical trials or in obtaining marketing approval thereafter. for example, although we have discovered and evaluated compounds using our novel gene control platform, we have not yet advanced a compound into any phase of clinical development.our gene control platform may fail to help us discover and develop additional potential product candidates. a significant portion of the research that we are conducting involves identifying novel targets and points of intervention and developing new compounds using our gene control platform. the drug discovery that we are conducting using our gene control platform may not be successful in identifying compounds that have commercial value or therapeutic utility. our gene control platform may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield viable product candidates for clinical development or commercialization for a number of reasons, including: compounds created through our gene control platform may not demonstrate efficacy, safety or tolerability; potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance; competitors may develop alternative therapies that render our potential product candidates non-competitive or less attractive; or a potential product candidate may not be capable of being produced at an acceptable cost. our research programs to identify new product candidates will require substantial technical, financial and human resources, and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to identify new product candidates. if we are unable to identify suitable additional compounds for preclinical and clinical development, our ability to develop product candidates and obtain product revenues in future periods could be compromised, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.in the near term, we are dependent on the success of sy-1425 and sy-1365. if we are unable to initiate or complete the clinical development of, obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize sy-1425 or sy-1365, either alone or with a collaborator, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be substantially harmed. we currently have no products approved for sale and are investing a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of sy-1425 and sy-1365. our prospects are substantially dependent on our ability, or that of any future collaborator, to develop, obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize product candidates in one or more disease indications. the success of sy-1425 and sy-1365 will depend on several factors, including the following: initiation and successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials; a safety, tolerability and efficacy profile that is satisfactory to the u.s. food and drug administration, or fda, or any comparable foreign regulatory authority for marketing approval; timely receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; the performance of our future collaborators, if any; the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities; establishment of supply arrangements with third-party raw materials suppliers and manufacturers including with respect to the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient for sy-1425; establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain finished drug product that is appropriately packaged for sale; adequate ongoing availability of raw materials and drug product for clinical development and any commercial sales; obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the united states and internationally, including our ability to maintain our license agreement with tmrc, which we refer to as the tmrc license agreement; protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; successful launch of commercial sales following any marketing approval; a continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval; commercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; successful identification of biomarkers for patient selection; continued availability of appropriate tissue samples to enable the identification of novel targets in genomically defined subsets of patients; and our ability to compete with other therapies. many of these factors are beyond our control, including clinical development, the regulatory submission process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the manufacturing, marketing and sales efforts of any future collaborator. if we are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for and successfully commercialize sy-1425 or sy-1365, on our own or with any future collaborator, or experience delays as a result of any of these factors or otherwise, our business could be substantially harmed.if clinical trials of any future product candidates that we, or any future collaborators, may develop fail to satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy to the fda and other regulators, we, or any future collaborators, may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of these product candidates. we, and any future collaborators, are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the united states without obtaining marketing approval from the fda. foreign regulatory authorities, such as the european medicines agency, or the ema, impose similar requirements. we, and any future collaborators, must complete extensive preclinical development and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans before we will be able to obtain these approvals. clinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome. we cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. the clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any stage of product development, including failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of adverse events that are severe or medically or commercially unacceptable, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements and determination by the fda or any comparable foreign regulatory authority that a product candidate may not continue development or is not approvable. for example, a phase2 clinical trial of tamibarotene (sy-1425) for the treatment of late-stage non-small cell lung cancer, or nsclc, under a previous license between tmrc and a third party was terminated when interim data suggested that the primary endpoint of progression-free survival for 18months after starting therapy would not be reached. interim data also showed that tamibarotene combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy was associated with increased toxicity in this non-selected nsclc patient population. although we have no current plans to conduct studies of sy-1425 in nsclc or combine tamibarotene with paclitaxel and carboplatin in late-stage nsclc patients, we face a similar risk of failure in our planned clinical trials of sy-1425. it is possible that even if one or more of our product candidates has a beneficial effect, that effect will not be detected during clinical evaluation as a result of one or more of a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of our clinical trials. conversely, as a result of the same factors, our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any. similarly, in our clinical trials we may fail to detect toxicity of or intolerability caused by our product candidates, or mistakenly believe that our product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated when that is not in fact the case. any inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us, or any future collaborators, and impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. moreover, if we, or any future collaborators, are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond the trials and testing that we or they contemplate, if we, or they, are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, or the results of these trials or tests are unfavorable, uncertain or are only modestly favorable, or there are unacceptable safety concerns associated with our product candidates, we, or any future collaborators, may: incur additional unplanned costs; be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates; not obtain marketing approval at all; obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings; be subject to additional post-marketing testing or other requirements; or be required to remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval. our failure to successfully initiate and complete clinical trials of our product candidates and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates would significantly harm our business.adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, product candidates that we develop may be identified during development and could delay or prevent their marketing approval or limit their use. adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, sy-1425, sy-1365 or any future product candidates that we may develop could cause us, any future collaborators, an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. because gene control techniques are relatively new, side effects from gene control approaches may be unpredictable. tamibarotene has been observed to be associated with adverse events, such as mild or moderate dry skin, skin rash, headache and bone pain, as well as retinoic acid syndrome and elevated levels of cholesterol, lipids, liver function enzymes and white blood cells, which were severe in certain cases. furthermore, retinoids such as sy-1425 may cause birth defects and therefore may carry a warning on their label. other examples of retinoids, a class of chemical compounds that are related to vitamin a, include all trans retinoic acid or atra, retin-a, retinol (found in over-the-counter skin creams), isotretinoin and bexarotene. we have not yet tested sy-1365 in humans so the safety profile that sy-1365 will demonstrate in human clinical trials is unknown. if any of our product candidates is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we, or any future collaborators, may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that prevented further development of the compound.if we, or any future collaborators, experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials of our current product candidate or any future product candidates that we, or any future collaborators, may develop, potential clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented. we, or any future collaborators, may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization of our current product candidate or any future product candidates that we, or any future collaborators, may develop, including: regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us, any future collaborators or our or their investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; we, or any future collaborators, may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites; clinical trials of our product candidates may produce unfavorable or inconclusive results; we, or any future collaborators, may decide, or regulators may require us or them, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we, or any future collaborators, anticipate, patient enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we, or any future collaborators, anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we, or any future collaborators, anticipate; our estimates of the genomically defined patient populations available for study may be higher than actual patient numbers and result in our inability to sufficiently enroll our trials; the cost of planned clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; our third-party contractors or those of any future collaborators, including those manufacturing our product candidates or components or ingredients thereof or conducting clinical trials on our behalf or on behalf of any future collaborators, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us or any future collaborators in a timely manner or at all; patients that enroll in a clinical trial may misrepresent their eligibility to do so or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to drop the patients from the clinical trial, increase the needed enrollment size for the clinical trial or extend the clinical trial's duration; we, or any future collaborators, may have to delay, suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate; regulators or institutional review boards may require that we, or any future collaborators, or our or their investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their standards of conduct, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate or findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar product or product candidate; the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our, or any future collaborators', clinical trial designs or our or their interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials; the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we, or any future collaborators, enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies; the supply or quality of raw materials or manufactured product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions
